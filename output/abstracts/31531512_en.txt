The study aimed to verify the association between birthweight of Terena children living in the urban area of Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil, and demographic, socioeconomic, and health variables and to describe the prevalence of low birthweight. Data were collective through home visits with a form completed with the mothers and based on records from the prenatal and neonatal cards. The sample included all the Terena women who gave birth to liveborn children from June 1, 2017, to July 31, 2018, and living in the Água Bonita, Darcy Ribeiro, Marçal de Souza, and Tarsila do Amaral villages. Birthweight was the outcome, and demographic, socioeconomic, and health characteristics were the exposure variables. A total of 43 mothers participated with their children. Low birthweight prevalence was 2.3%. In the final model, children living in households with makeshift cesspools showed lower birthweight when compared to those living in households connected to the public sewage disposal system, and daughters of mothers who were obese prior to the pregnancy presented higher birthweight than those born to normal weight mothers, according to pregestational body mass index. The data seek to contribute to discussions on the health and nutrition of this important share of the indigenous population that lives in urban areas.
