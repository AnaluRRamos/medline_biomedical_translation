To evaluate the correlation of morphological criteria of the cecal appendix using computed tomography (CT) and the possible risk of developing acute appendicitis. Cases were defined as patients with surgically confirmed acute appendicitis who had undergone CT at least twice: at diagnosis and at least one month prior. Controls were defined as emergency patients with abdominal pain who had undergone abdominal CT that excluded acute appendicitis and had also undergone CT at least one month before. 100 cases and 100 controls were selected for inclusion in the final analysis. Comparisons between the cases and controls revealed the following: mean transverse diameter of 0.6 cm (range, 0.4-1.0 cm) versus 0.6 cm (range, 0.6-0.8 cm; <i>p</i> = 0.37); mean length of 6.6 cm (range, 3.5-9.7 cm) versus 6.6 cm (range, 4.5-8.3 cm; <i>p</i> = 0.87); mean angle of 100째 (range, 23-178째) versus 86째 (range, 43-160째; <i>p</i> = 0.01); vertical descending orientation in 56% versus 45% (<i>p</i> = 0.2); absence of gas in 69% versus 77% (<i>p</i> = 0.34); and presence of an appendicolith in 17% versus 8% (<i>p</i> = 0.08). Hypothetical risk factors for obstruction of the vermiform appendix detected on CT were not associated with acute appendicitis. That suggests that factors other than those related to mechanical obstruction are implicated in the pathogenesis of acute appendicitis.
