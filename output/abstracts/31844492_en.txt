Cognitive deficits in Parkinson's disease typically affect executive functions. Recently, the concept of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) has been related to PD (PD-MCI). PD-MCI is considered a transition phase to Parkinson's disease Dementia. Therefore, it is important to identify PD-MCI in a reliable way. To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the INECO Frontal Screening (IFS) in detecting cognitive deficits in PD-MCI. Additionally, we compare the IFS and the Addenbrook Cognitive Examination Revised (ACE-R) between three groups; PD-MCI, MCI, and controls. The IFS and ACE-R were administered to 36 patients with PD-MCI, 31 with MCI (amnestic-multidomain subtype) and 92 healthy controls. Sensitivity and specificity were determined using ROC analysis. The groups were compared using one-way analysis of variance. The IFS had adequate accuracy in differentiating patients with PD-MCI from healthy controls (AUC=0.77, sensitivity=0.82, specificity=0.77), and good accuracy in differentiating PD-MCI from MCI patients (AUC=0.80, sensitivity=0.82, specificity=0.61). However the IFS had low accuracy in differentiating MCI patients from healthy controls (AUC=0.47, sensitivity=0.52, specificity=0.41). On the ACE-R, the PD-MCI group had low performance in Fluency and Language. Only patients with PD-MCI had difficulties on the IFS, specifically in inhibitory control and visual working memory. This dysexecutive profile explains the sensitivity and specificity values found in the IFS. The present study results suggest that the IFS is a suitable screening tool for exploring cognitive dysfunction in PD-MCI, especially in those patients with a dysexecutive profile.
