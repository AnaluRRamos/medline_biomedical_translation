The high frequency of learning difficulties, attention disorders or developmental delay in children in the early years of schooling has resulted in a greater demand for pediatric services. Such services generally include assessments covering various specialties, are lengthy and often inaccessible to families due to prohibitively high cost. This paper presents an economically efficient model of interdisciplinary diagnosis. A group of 109 Brazilian students from public schools aged between 5 and 14 years old, referred by teachers for a history of learning disabilities, behavioral changes or language problems, was evaluated at the NANI (Nucleo de Atendimento Neuropsicologico Infantil). Assessments were performed simultaneously during a single day's attendance and comprised clinical-genetic examination, behavioral assessment and neuropsychological screening, specially developed for the process. The multiaxial system of DSM-IV was adopted for diagnostic description. The results revealed heterogeneity in diagnoses which included specific learning disorders (25.7%), mild intellectual disabilities (17.43%), as well as suspected dysmorphic features (11.93%). Logistic regression showed good sensitivity of neuropsychological screening in the detection of predictive factors for specific developmental disorders, while working memory (p=0.05) and language (p=0.02) problems were found to be higher risk. The model adopted proved to be useful for defining the diagnosis of several conditions in infancy, and can be incorporated into specialized clinics such as psychiatric or developmental pediatric services.
