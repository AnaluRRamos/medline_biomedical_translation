Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) acquired the features of a chronic disease, thus requiring long-term follow-up. Different forms of work organization might prevent or increase the likelihood of poorer clinical prognosis. To analyze HIV clinical monitoring indicators according to work shift, work ability and fatigue symptoms relative to workers living with HIV. Cross-sectional study conducted with 115 workers (daytime: 97; night shift: 18) living with HIV followed up at the Specialized Care Service of Santos, Sao Paulo, Brazil. Generalized linear models (with LSD as <i>post hoc</i> test) were fitted to compare viral load, CD4+ T cell count and CD4+/CD8+ ratio according to work shift, work ability and fatigue symptoms adjusted for sex, age, time since diagnosis, duration of antiretroviral therapy, use of efavirenz and psychoactive substances, and emotional disorders. We found association of fatigue symptoms with CD4+ T cell count and CD4+/CD8+ ratio; the CD4+ T cell count was higher among the participants with moderate need for recovery after work (p=0.02) and the CD4+/CD8+ ratio among those with lower need for recovery (p=0.03). We also found a borderline relationship (p=0.05) between work shift and CD4+ T cell count, which was lower for night workers. Difference was not found in the analyzed indicators as a function of work ability. HIV clinical monitoring indicators were poorer for night workers and better for those with more severe fatigue symptoms. Work ability did not influence HIV clinical monitoring indicators.
