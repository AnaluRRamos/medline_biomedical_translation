The complexity of the pathological reactions of the brain to an aggression caused by an internal or external noxa represents a challenge for molecular imaging. Positron emission tomography (PET) can indicate <i>in vivo,</i> anatomopathological changes involved in the development of different clinical symptoms in patients with neurodegenerative disorders. PET and the multitracer concept can provide information from different systems in the brain tissue building an image of the whole disease. We present here the combination of <sup>18</sup>F-flourodeoxyglucose (FDG) and N-[<sup>11</sup>C-methyl]-L-deuterodeprenyl (DED), FDG and N-[<sup>11</sup>C-methyl] 2-(4'-methylaminophenyl)-6-hydroxybenzothiazole (PIB), PIB and L-[<sup>11</sup>C]-3'4-Dihydrophenylalanine (DOPA) and finally PIB and [<sup>15</sup>O]H2O.
