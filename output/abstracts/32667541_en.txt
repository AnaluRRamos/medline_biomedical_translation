The scope of this study was to analyze the distribution of anthropometric variables according to demographic, socioeconomic, and health characteristics among children of Haitian descent between 0 and 5 years of age living in Cuiab√°-MT. It consists of a cross-sectional and census-based study with data collected between August 2016 and February 2017. The dependent variables were body mass index (BMI) and height-for-age z-score, using Student's t-Test and ANOVA in the statistical analysis. A total of 67 children, 73.2% to 24 months of age and 34.3% being male, were evaluated. There was a significant proportion of families with per capita income of less than 1/4 of the minimum wage (65.6%), with no home monitoring for the family health strategy (88.1%), and long working hours for mothers (43.3%). The onset of prenatal care until the third month of pregnancy and female sex were associated with higher BMI averages. For height-for-age, an association with lower mean values was found for households with more than one resident per room, higher age range of the child, and child-care in daycare centers. Thus, although few factors have an association with the anthropometric indications evaluated, it is necessary to consider the precarious socioeconomic conditions in which these children find themselves.
