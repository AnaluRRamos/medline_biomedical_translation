Scientific and technological advances, coupled with the work of multidisciplinary teams in intensive care units, have increased the survival of critically ill patients. An essential life support resource used in intensive care is extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Despite the increased number of studies involving critically ill patients, few studies to date have demonstrated the safety and benefits of physical therapy combined with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. This review identified the clinical outcomes of physical therapy in adult patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support by searching the MEDLINEÂ®, PEDro, Cochrane CENTRAL, LILACS, and EMBASE databases and by manually searching the references of the articles published until September 2017. The database search retrieved 1,213 studies. Of these studies, 20 were included in this review, with data on 317 subjects (58 in the control group). Twelve studies reported that there were no complications during physical therapy. Cannula fracture during ambulation (one case), thrombus in the return cannula (one case), and leg swelling (one case) were reported in two studies, and desaturation and mild vertigo were reported in two studies. In contrast, improvements in respiratory/pulmonary function, functional capacity, muscle strength (with reduced muscle mass loss), incidence of myopathy, length of hospitalization, and mortality in patients who underwent physical therapy were reported. The analysis of the available data indicates that physical therapy, including early progressive mobilization, standing, ambulation, and breathing techniques, together with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, is feasible, relatively safe, and potentially beneficial for critically ill adult patients.
