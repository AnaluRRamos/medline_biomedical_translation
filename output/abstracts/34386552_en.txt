Diverticular disease of the vermiform appendix (DDA) has an incidence of 0.004 to 2.1% in appendicectomy specimens. DDA is variably associated with perforation and malignancy. We report a single-center experience of DDA. The primary aim is to validate the association of DDA with complicated appendicitis or malignancy, and the secondary aim is to validate systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria and quick Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) scores. The histopathology reports of 2,305 appendicectomy specimens from January 2011 to December 2015 were reviewed. Acute appendicitis was found in 2,164 (93.9%) specimens. Histology of the remaining 141 (6.1%) patients revealed: normal appendix (<i>n</i> = 110), DDA (<i>n</i> = 22), endometriosis of appendix (<i>n</i> = 6), and an absent appendix (<i>n</i> = 3). Patient demographics, clinical profile, operative data, and perioperative outcomes of DDA patients are studied. Modified Alvarado score, Andersson score, SIRS criteria, and qSOFA scores were retrospectively calculated. The incidence of DDA was 0.95%. Ten patients (45.5%) had diverticulitis. The mean age of DDA patients was 39.5 years (range 23-87), with male preponderance (<i>n</i> = 12, 54.5%). The median Modified Alvarado score was 8 (range 4-9), and the median Andersson score was 5 (range 2-8). Fourteen patients (63.6%) had SIRS, and none had a high qSOFA score. Eight patients (36.4%) had complicated appendicitis (perforation [<i>n</i> = 2] or abscess [<i>n</i> = 6]). Eleven (50%) patients underwent laparoscopic appendicectomy. There were three 30-day readmissions and no mortality. DDA is a distinct clinical pathology associated with complicated appendicitis.
