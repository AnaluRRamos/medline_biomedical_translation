Evaluate the reproducibility of Forling, a portable instrument for measuring axial tongue force. Axial force of the tongue was measured in 49 individuals (30 women and 19 men) aged 18-25 years using the Forling portable instrument. Measurements were performed in three days at intervals of 7Â±2 days. On each day, three 7-second measurements were performed with one-minute intervals between them. The coefficient of variation, Wilcoxon paired test, and intraclass correlation coefficient were used in the statistical analysis of the data. Maximum and mean tongue force values were analyzed, and comparison between them was performed using three approaches: the mean of the three values; the mean of the two highest values; the highest value of each measurement. In the analysis of mean tongue force, the coefficient of variation was considered desirable and the intraclass correlation coefficient was acceptable. Significant differences were observed regarding the maximum value between the second and third days, mean of the two highest values and mean of the three values between the first and second days and the second and third days. In the analysis of maximum tongue force, the coefficient of variation and the intraclass correlation coefficient were acceptable. Significant difference was found only in the comparison between the second and third days. Good reproducibility of the data obtained with the use of the Forling portable instrument was observed.
