This article describes and analyzes the role of governance in the development of the Chilean community mental health model. It describes and analyzes five dimensions of governance: 1) the implementation of a series of strategies to encourage the participation of users of mental health services has yielded limited results; 2) the implementation of three national mental health plans with the same strategic vision over the course of three decades has helped increase access to community care for people with mental illness and diminish the role of psychiatric hospitals; 3) the lack of a mental health law remains a challenge, although a series of laws and decrees has partially compensated for this; 4) financial resource allocation regulations, human resources education, and technical guidelines have helped improve access and the quality of care; and 5) the gradual development of a mental health information system has provided knowledge, primarily on access rates, treatment gaps, and geographical inequities. The Chilean experience confirms the importance of implementing a set of governance strategies and mechanisms to promote the development and operation of mental health services. The type of governance strategies and mechanisms can vary from country to country, depending on the context and windows of opportunity.
