The Oral Health Policy of the Federal District State Health Secretariat was in a fragmented state, similarly to the entire health system. There was no integration between oral health teams and other Primary Care professionals and performance at the other levels was inconsistent and limited, preventing the effective establishment of the Care Network. In 2017, the head management chose to convert the system organically based on the family health strategy and the logic of the care networks. The aim of this study is to report on the main actions carried out so that oral health care would conform to the changes, developing into the construction of the specific Care Line in the area, allowing increased access and qualification of care .
