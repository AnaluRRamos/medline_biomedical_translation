To assess the Perme mobility scale score as a predictor of functional status and complications in the postoperative period in patients undergoing liver transplantation. The sample consisted of 30 patients who underwent liver transplantation. The patients were evaluated at two time points to determine their perception of pain, degree of dyspnea, peripheral muscle strength, and functional status according to the Perme scale. The collected data were analyzed by descriptive and inferential statistics. To compare the means between the evaluations, Student's t test for paired samples was applied. In case of asymmetry, the Wilcoxon test was used. In the evaluation of the association between the quantitative variables, the Pearson or Spearman correlation tests were applied. A total of 30 individuals who underwent liver transplantation were included. The patients were predominantly male, and the mean age was 58.4 Â± 9.9 years. The most prevalent underlying pathology was cirrhosis C virus (23.3%). Significant associations of the time on mechanical ventilation with the Perme scale score at discharge from the intensive care unit (r = -0.374; p = 0.042) and the number of physical therapy treatments (r = -0.578; p = 0.001) were recorded. When comparing the results of the initial evaluation and the evaluation at hospital discharge, there was a significant improvement in functional status (p < 0.001). Functional mobility, peripheral muscle strength, pain perception, and dyspnea are significantly improved at hospital discharge compared with those at inpatient unit admission.
