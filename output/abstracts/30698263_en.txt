We evaluated the association between quality of life, family cohesion and sociodemographic factors of beneficiary families of the BolsaFam√≠lia Program (PBF). This was an analytical, cross-sectional study with exploratory methodology. The sample was composed of 385 respondents. The dependent variable was the quality of life (WHOQOL-BREF), and the independent variables were sociodemographic characteristics, self-rated health, family cohesion and adaptability (FACES III). The best quality of life was associated with an age younger than or equal to 36 years (OR = 2.15), higher educational level (OR = 1.54), good/very good health (OR = 6.39), not having current health problem (OR = 5.68), no treatment (OR = 1.76), moderate (OR = 3.39) and high (OR = 3.66) family cohesion and moderate adaptability (OR = 2.23). Individuals from families with moderate and high family cohesion were more likely to have a better quality of life than those from families with low cohesion. The male volunteers were 3.54 times more likely to have a better quality of life. It was concluded that moderate and high levels of cohesion may impact positively to the quality of life of persons receiving the PBF, indicating that social programs should seek to strengthen these dynamics.
