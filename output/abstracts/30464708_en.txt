To verify if there is consensus about the treatment of each type of injury or amputation of the fingertips, and if there is a statistical difference among the treatment options according to the surgeon's length of time in the hand surgery specialty. A cross-sectional survey was conducted during the 37th Brazilian Congress of Hand Surgery, when one hundred and twenty questionnaires were randomly distributed. Observing the inclusion and exclusion criteria, ninety completed questionnaires were included. The answers were submitted to descriptive and inferential analysis with a significance level of p <0.05. This study showed agreement of 63.3% for the treatment with statistical difference for dorsal oblique injury less than 1 cm with bone exposure for the VY advancement flap alternative; 46.7% for volar tip oblique injury with bone exposure less than 1 cm for the Cross Finger alternative; 47.8% for oblique thumb volar injury greater than 1 cm with no bone exposure to the Moberg alternative; 54.4% for thumb pulp injury up to 2.5 cm with bone exposure to the Moberg alternative with proximal release, and 92.2% for antibiotic use, for the 'cephalexin' alternative. There is no consensus regarding the treatment of most types of fingertip lesions, with agreement of 45.4%. When we subdivided by time group of specialty in hand surgery, there was an increase in agreement to 54.5% of the questions per subgroup. Further comparative studies are needed to assess the consensus among surgeons regarding the treatment of fingertip injury. <b><i>Level of Evidence III; Cross-sectional survey.</i></b>
