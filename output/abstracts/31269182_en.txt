The 'Bolsa Fam√≠lia' Program (BFP) is an income transfer program based on meeting certain conditions, being Brazil's main strategy for combating extreme poverty, hunger and social inequality. To satisfy the educational criteria, the offspring of the beneficiary families must attend school and score minimum school attendance rates. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review to assess the outcomes (effects and impact) of the BFP on educational indicators among the beneficiary families. A search was conducted in the Medline, Lilacs, EBSCO, Econstor, Science Direct and Web of Knowledge databases and the methodological quality of the articles included was evaluated using the Downs & Black checklist. Of the 2,391 studies identified, only 12 were selected. There was evidence that BFP had positive outcomes on educational indicators for the female gender and for the Northern region of Brazil. The results showed that BFP has no impact on academic proficiency and performance, but has a significant impact on school attendance and dropout rates.
