The aim of this article is to present a description and analysis of the scientific production in Epidemiology of the Journal Ciência & Saúde Coletiva since its creation in 1996. The titles and abstracts of all articles published in three periods (1996 to 2002, 2011 and 2019) were read and those related to Epidemiology were analyzed. These publications were classified according to the thematic area, study design, sampling method and sample size, and place of origin of the first author. The percentage of epidemiological articles published in the journal jumped from 12.8% in the first period to 31.0% in 2011, and to 55.3% in 2019. The most studied topics were chronic non-communicable diseases (20.3%), nutritional epidemiology (12.2%) and evaluation of health systems, policies, programs and services (10.9%). Descriptive/cross-sectional studies, conducted among adults and from the Southeast region, predominated. The results indicate the need for greater participation of cohort studies, case-control and clinical trials in the scope of the journal's publications, in addition to articles that use more sophisticated statistical methods and well-defined theoretical models, which may contribute in a more relevant way to prevention and control of health problems.
