The aim of this paper was to assess the prevalence of suicide ideation and attempts in Portuguese psychiatry trainees (adult and child and adolescence), and compare the data with the general population and other European countries. A structured and anonymous questionnaire was sent by email to 159 portuguese trainees of adult psychiatry and child and adolescence psychiatry with questions about personal history of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts, as well as family history of suicide attempts and completed suicides. This is part of the BoSS Study (Burnout Syndrome Study) performed in 21 countries worldwide. Data was analysed in SPSS v.19. From the inquired population, 62 trainees (40,3%) partially responded, and 46 (29%) were complete responders - these entered the final analysis. There was a ratio of 2:1 (female:male) and a mean age of 29 years. The suicidal ideation was present in passive form in 44% and in active form in 33%; also, 4.3% of respondents had previous suicide attempts. In first degree relatives, 22% had attempted suicide and 13% completed suicide. The results are worriying and may be associated with some factors to which this population is exposed. It is necessary further research to better understand this phenomenon, its causes and potential modifiers.
