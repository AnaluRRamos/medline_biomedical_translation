This article presents a methodology for professional training in obstetrics nursing (ON) that goes beyond teaching specific competencies and contributes to the change in the model of childbirth care as proposed by Brazilian Unified Health System. This methodology addresses gaps and challenges in the current ON model and it builds on existing initiatives for the inclusion of ON in the teamwork environment. The training-intervention-evaluation method proposes the inclusion of evaluation as part of the training, which is in line with methods for intervention research. A triangulation of strategies, techniques, and instruments is conducted articulated to analytical dimensions of obstetric and neonatal care. This methodology was implemented in multicentric ON courses coordinated by the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG) between 2016 and 2018. A total of 20 ON courses across states, 1,150 professionals (students, faculty, coordinators, preceptors, and supervisors), and 400 health services (internship fields and teaching hospitals) participated in the process. In conclusion, based on the experiences of those participating in this project, the implementation of this methodology produced nurses more qualified and better prepared for practice and for adapting the model of childbirth care.
