Systematic screening for TORCH infections and group B Streptococcus (GBS) during pregnancy has been an important factor in the improvement of perinatal care. To evaluate TORCH serology and GBS carriers state in the population of a maternity, to assess variability with age and nationality and to search for congenital infections. Non-probabilistic prevalence study. 9508 TORCH and 2639 GBS results were registered. Immunity rate for rubella was 93.3%, higher for Portuguese women; for toxoplasmosis it was 25.7%, higher among the oldest and foreign women; IgG for CMV was positive in 62.4%, no influence of age was found. VDRL was reactive in 0.5%; HBsAg was found to be positive in 2.3%, higher in foreign women. Antibodies for hepatitis C virus and HIV were found respectively in 1.4% and 0.7%. No congenital infections were diagnosed. GBS carrier state was found in 13.9%. A high rate of positive IgG was found for rubella reflecting vaccines policy. For toxoplasmosis the low rate of positives means that a high number of pregnant women have to repeat serology during pregnancy with inherent costs. Like in the general population, a high rate of CMV positive mothers was found. For some infections we found that foreign women had different conditions. Knowledge on TORCH and GBS state helps to better draw guidelines concerning screening policies during pregnancy.
