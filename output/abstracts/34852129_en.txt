To describe the evolution of decrees and indicators related to COVID-19 in Santa Catarina, Brazil, up until August 2020. This was an ecological study that analyzed epidemiological indicators and state decrees on social distancing. The decrees were grouped into restriction, maintenance and relaxation. The indicators were mortality, incidence and transmissibility. 179,443 cases and 2,183 deaths were recorded in the period. The incidence rate went from 20.4 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in March to 642.2 in August. Fifteen state decrees were issued. In August, when the highest mortality rate was observed (13.1 per 100,000 inhabitants), it was found that all decree categories, except one, had been relaxed. The decrees that relaxed social distancing measures were issued early and in disagreement with the epidemiological context in the state.
