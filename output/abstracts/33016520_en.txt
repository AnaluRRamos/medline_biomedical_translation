Equine sarcoids are the most prevalent skin neoplasm in horses worldwide. Although several treatments are available, none are consistently effective and recurrence is common. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of topical imiquimod 5% cream and Sanguinaria canadensis + zinc chloride for treatment of equine sarcoids and investigate possible systemic effects on distant untreated sarcoids. Twenty-five client-owned horses with a total of 164 tumours were included in the study. Fifty-seven tumours were treated and 107 tumours were left untreated. Skin biopsy samples were collected from a minimum of one tumour per horse and the rest were diagnosed based on clinical appearance as likely sarcoids. Imiquimod 5% (A) was applied three times weekly, while Sanguinaria canadensis + zinc chloride (X) was applied every fourth day after a six day daily initiation phase. Treatment continued until clinical remission or for a maximum of 45 weeks, with a long follow-up period (mean 34 months). Skin biopsy samples of sarcoid lesions were re-taken before treatment termination and at follow-up if the owner gave consent. Complete remission was recorded in 84.4% (A) and 75.0% (X) of the tumours. Relapse was recorded in 7.3% (A) and 21.4% (X). Spontaneous remission was observed in 1.9% of untreated tumours. No systemic effect on untreated tumours was detected. During treatment varying degrees of local inflammatory reaction were common. Both treatments were considered effective and safe. Smaller tumours responded more favourably to treatment. Relapse rate was low and not observed in sarcoids with repeat biopsies before treatment termination.
