This study compares the challenges for work in emergency services of publicuniversity hospitals in Algeria, Brazil and France. The description and analysis are organized in three topics: context and trajectory of the health systems; hospitals and emergency services; and the challenges that are faced. The research carried out interviews, surveys, observation and 'groupes de rencontre du travail' / GRT. The data analysis was done using participatory appraisal techniques associated to triangulation of sources and data. The main challenges found were: workforce deficit; lack of hospitals beds in inpatient units; deficit of infrastructure and materials; excess of 'chronophagic activities'; generational transition; and violence by patients and families.Despite their particularities, the countries coincide regarding the challenges. Measures to rationalize and restrain spending have a greater impact on Algeria and Brazil due to the low level of public funding, but they also occur in France. The hospital management cannot be dissociated from healthcare system planningconsidering the increasing pressures of the demographic and epidemiological transition. In medium term, measures that may mitigate 'chronophagic activities', materials deficit and the violence should be considered to improve work in emergencies.
