The study aimed to investigate psychometric indicators of validity in the new version of CASP-19 for Brazilians 55 years and older and to study relations between scores on the scale and sex, age, schooling, and conjugal status. A total of 368 participants enrolled in educational programs for the elderly answered the CASP-19 scale (control, autonomy, self-realization, and pleasure), translated from English by five specialists and tested in 19 women (α = 0.730). The data were submitted to exploratory factors analyses (EFA) and confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) using the structural equations method for latent variables and for internal consistency and correlation with scales of similar content. The scores were compared according to sex, age, schooling, and conjugal status. CFA produced a model with 19 items and 2 factors (self-realization/pleasure and control/autonomy), with good fit indices (GFI = 0.8; AGFI = 0.7606; CFI = 0.7241; NNFI = 0.6876; SRMR = 0.0902; RMSEA = 0.0928; 90%CI: 0.0827-0.1031). Cronbach's α was 0.837 for factor 1 and 0.670 for factor 2, and 0.874 on the total scale for individuals with 9 or more years of schooling, 0.834 for 5 to 8 years, and 0.772 for 1 to 4 years. High and significant correlations were observed with the scores in scales on satisfaction and subjective happiness. Men scored higher than women on self-realization/pleasure; older individuals and those with the most schooling scored lower on control/autonomy; individuals with a spouse or partner scored higher on control/autonomy. The new version of CASP-19 was effective in assessing self-rated quality of life in individuals 55 years or older in residents of the Southeast, South, and Northeast of Brazil.
