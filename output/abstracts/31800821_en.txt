To verify the association of stress factors and depressive symptoms with the academic performance of nursing students. Cross-sectional, quantitative, observational research conducted at a public university in Manaus. Socio-demographic data, academic performance coefficient and individual semester performance, the Instrument for the Assessment of Stress in Nursing Students and the CES-D Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale were used to characterize the students. Pearson's correlation coefficient, ANOVA test and multiple linear regression were used for the analysis. 155 nursing students participated in the study. The stress factors 'performance of practical activities', 'professional communication' and 'professional education' had a positive correlation with individual semester performance, while the factors 'depressive affect', 'interpersonal' and 'somatic/attitudes' had a negative correlation. The present study identified positive impacts of stress factors on academic performance, however, the presence of depressive symptoms was associated with lower academic performance.
