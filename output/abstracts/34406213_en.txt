The objective of this study was to analyze the positions and developments in the Brazilian Congress in an inquiry from March to August 2020 on policy for COVID-19 treatment using chloroquine. The analysis aimed to identify the factors situating this policy in the context of government action during the pandemic. The ethnographic artifacts used for the analysis included the videoconferences of the committee meetings and public hearings and the stenographic notes publicly available on the Chamber of Deputies website. The analysis showed that the debate on chloroquine was forged from scientific evidence used with a denialist perspective, prioritizing the search for uncertainty as a way of fomenting dissent and thus sustaining personal convictions and ideologies. By rejecting empirically backed proposals and scientific consensus itself, the attempt was to create a false appearance of debate. The objective was to convince the public that there were no sufficient grounds for rejecting the use of chloroquine to treat COVID-19. Thus, the success achieved by the government was not based on verification of truths, but as the result of a temporary accommodation that stabilized this purported fact not through certainties, but through fear of doubt.
