To determine whether the radiomic features of lung lesions on computed tomography correlate with overall survival in lung cancer patients. This was a retrospective study involving 101 consecutive patients with malignant neoplasms confirmed by biopsy or surgery. On computed tomography images, the lesions were submitted to semi-automated segmentation and were characterized on the basis of 2,465 radiomic variables. The prognostic assessment was based on Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank tests, according to the median value of the radiomic variables. Of the 101 patients evaluated, 28 died (16 dying from lung cancer), and 73 were censored, with a mean overall survival time of 1,819.4 days (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1,481.2-2,157.5). One radiomic feature (the mean of the Fourier transform) presented a difference on Kaplan-Meier curves (<i>p</i> < 0.05). A high-risk group of patients was identified on the basis of high values for the mean of the Fourier transform. In that group, the mean survival time was 1,465.4 days (95% CI: 985.2-1,945.6), with a hazard ratio of 2.12 (95% CI: 1.01-4.48). We also identified a low-risk group, in which the mean of the Fourier transform was low (mean survival time of 2,164.8 days; 95% CI: 1,745.4-2,584.1). A radiomic signature based on the Fourier transform correlates with overall survival, representing a prognostic biomarker for risk stratification in patients with lung cancer.
