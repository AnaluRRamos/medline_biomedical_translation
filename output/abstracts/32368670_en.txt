Cytotechnologists are laboratory professionals who analyze cytology slides under optical microscopes. Static postures, speed and repetitive movements are associated with occurrence of musculoskeletal complaints. To establish the main musculoskeletal complaints among cytotechnologists at the National Cancer Institute, Brazil, test associations between absenteeism due to musculoskeletal complaints and individual and occupational variables, and characterize absenteeism related to diseases of the musculoskeletal system in 2016 and 2017. Cross-sectional study in which we administered the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire and tested associations between exposure variables and absenteeism. We also analyzed morbidity records kept at the Occupational Health Division (OHD) to establish the main disorders related to absenteeism. Associations were investigated by means of Fisher's test using SPSS version 20.0. The significance level was set to p<0.05. 34.4% of the sample required sick leave due to musculoskeletal complaints. The most affected body site was the neck (18%). As per the OHD records, sickness absenteeism was mainly due to diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue (25%). We found statistically significant association of absenteeism with length in the job and body mass index. Diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue were the main reason for missing work days. Absenteeism was associated with length in the job and high body mass index.
