The aim of this study was to evaluate dental and skeletal changes induced by the use of Herbst appliance compared to natural growth in young adults with Class II division I malocclusion with mandibular retrusion, by means of lateral oblique radiographs. Forty-six subjects, I4 -18 years old, after pubertal growth peak, with Class II division I malocclusion were assessed. Subjects were divided into two groups: the Experimental group included 23 subjects treated with Metallic Splinted Herbst and the Control group included 23 subjects followed without treatment. The Experimental and Control groups were paired by sex and chronological age. Oblique lateral cephalometric radiographs of the left and the right side of the mandible before treatment (TI) and after 8 months' treatment (T2) were used to evaluate dental and skeletal changes. Statistical analysis was performed with Intra Class Correlation and Student t-test, according to the study hypothesis. The results showed that the appliance corrected the Class II relationship in an 8-month period by mesial tipping movement of lower permanent first molars. It had little influence on mandibular structure and mandibular length and no influence on maxillary structure and upper molar. To conclude, late treatment of Class II malocclusion with the Herbst appliance was accomplished by means of dentoalveolar changes. These findings suggest that this type of treatment can be used in patients after growth has ceased because the results do not depend upon skeletal changes.
