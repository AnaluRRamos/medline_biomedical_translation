This article aims to evaluate the quality of life of working women and its relationship with sociodemographic and occupational aspects. Cross-sectional study in a sample of 579 working women in a city with a population of 318,000. Data was collected by means of questionnaires for sociodemographic, occupational and WHOQOL-BREF characteristics. For the analysis, we used descriptive statistics, t-student test and the Pearson correlation. The working women on average were 42.70 Â±13.74 years old; there was a predominance of Caucasians with 9 to 12 years of formal education and an individual monthly minimum-wage income at a single job as a registered employee or civil servant. The average Quality of Life was 72.87, with a better result in the area of Social Relations and the lowest in the area of Environment. The Environment domain was significantly more compromised in women who did not have rest breaks during work, those who did not have good relationships with their coworkers, had more diseases or injuries, less formal education and lower monthly income. The Social Relations domain was significantly compromised by the number of injuries or diseases.
