We reviewed the scientific production on maternal health and the health of children under ten years of age, published in Journal Ciência & Saúde Coletiva during the last 25 years, focusing on quantitative studies. The authors' characteristics, populations under study, thematic areas, and methodology are described. A total of 170 publications were identified and grouped into 12 major themes. Pregnancy, delivery, and puerperium were the subject of 47 studies, followed by child anthropometric assessments (29), breastfeeding (24), and mortality (13). The selected publications represented 3.5% of the total original papers published by the Journal since its creation in 1996 and about 5% of the publications in the 2015-2020 period. The primary data sources were health service records, information systems, and population surveys. The cross-sectional design was used in 113 of the 170 articles, and 70% covered only one municipality. The Southeast and Northeast Regions of Brazil were the target of most studies, and the North Region was the least represented. The publications reflect the complexity of maternal and child health themes, with a particular focus on the importance of the Unified Health System and showing how open access data can contribute to public health research.
