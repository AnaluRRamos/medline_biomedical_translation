Subcortical Ischemic Vascular Disease (SIVD) is underdiagnosed. This review investigates the relationship among SIVD severity, cognitive status and neuroimaging markers. Cohort, cross-sectional and case control studies were searched on ISI, Medline, Scielo, PsychoInfo and LILACS databases published between 1995 and 2006. The most impaired cognitive domains were executive, attentional and memory retrieval mechanisms. These cognitive features were frequently associated to White Matter Lesions (WML). WML is an independent factor in cognitive decline. However, the threshold for this impact is not yet clearly established.
