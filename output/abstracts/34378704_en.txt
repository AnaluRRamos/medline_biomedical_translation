The study analyzed and compared the types of food sold in the surroundings of 30 private and 26 public elementary schools in the city of Niter√≥i, Rio de Janeiro. Data were collected by audit using a checklist instrument to characterize establishments (formal or informal) and identify the types of food and beverages sold, which were classified by processing level (fresh, processed, and ultraprocessed). Mann-Whitney statistical tests were used to verify the difference in the type of trade outlets d the categories of food sold between schools. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to verify the difference in the amount of food traded between the categories. The amount of ultraprocessed food in the surroundings of public and private schools was statistically higher (p=0.0001) than the other categories. Some culinary preparations had a high rate of energy contribution from ultraprocessed foods (above 15%). There was no statistically significant difference (p = 0.478) in the categories of food sold between public and private schools. The sale of ultraprocessed products predominates around public and private schools, favoring the exposure of children to an environment that encourages the consumption of these products.
