This study aimed to characterize women's socioeconomic and epidemiological profile in Uberaba according to the breast cancer screening practice and identify associated factors with this practice. This is a cross-sectional research part of the Women's Health Survey in Uberaba (MG). Data was collected by home interview, referring to socioeconomic and epidemiological issues and breast cancer screening practice, from a sample of 1,520 women above 20 years of age. After processing the data, we performed statistical analysis with measures of association by the Chi-square test, bivariate and multivariate Poisson regression, with a significance level of 5%. The results showed a profile of breast cancer screening practice with white women (66%), high schooling and per capita income, in common-law marriage (67,5%), non-heads of households (64,4%) and non-smokers (64,6%). Factors associated with higher practice were the age groups 40-49 and 50-69 years (PR = 0.7 and 0.64), per capita income higher than one minimum wage (PR = 1.17) and public or health plan mammography coverage (PR = 1.98 and 1.94). We can conclude that factors associated with breast cancer screening practice have been identified in the studied sample.
