The international literature points out an association between stress and psychosocial factors at work (PFW) in different occupational groups. Among health care workers, providing direct patient care might be rewarding or contribute to cause stress, and central sterile services departments (CSSD) provide relevant support to in-hospital care. To investigate PFW liable to cause stress among the nursing staff of a university hospital CSSD. Quantitative and qualitative study of a non-probabilistic sample of 63 workers who responded a sociodemographic questionnaire and the Effort-Reward Imbalance (ERI) scale. Fifty-one participants were also subjected to individual interviews, which were recorded, transcribed and subjected to content analysis, resulting in thematic matrices and categories. The sample mainly comprised women (92%) and was aged 45 years old, on average. Effort-reward imbalance was found for 16% of the participants. Working conditions, equipment and materials, relationship among coworkers, and management support were listed as factors related to job satisfaction or dissatisfaction. Lack of peer recognition was described as the main factor associated with dissatisfaction and stress. CSSD workers feel they are stigmatized and underestimated by their coworkers involved in direct patient care and the institution as a whole. Recognition of the work done is fundamental for job satisfaction and health protection and preservation.
