This paper presents a historical narrative about the incidence of pemphigus foliaceus in Brazil in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. This autoimmune blistering skin disease is more common in children, adolescents, and young adults who live in rural areas of endemic regions. It was first described in Brazil in 1903 by the physician Caramuru Paes Leme. The main foci of the disease are in the Federal District and the states of Goiás, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Minas Gerais, Paraná, and São Paulo. This research topic, which has attracted widespread attention from medical practice, especially dermatology, has not received similar attention from historians of health and disease.
