The Social Participation in Health has been consolidated in the Unified Health System through the efforts of the Municipal, State, National Councils and Health Conferences. The division into municipalities isconstitutionally prohibited in the Federal District and, therefore, there is a District Health Council and the Regional Health Councils. The aim was to describe the profile of the Federal District Health Council, analyzing its actions in Primary Health Care from 2016 to 2018. This was a qualitative case study, with documentary collection using the Iramuteq software. A statistical report of the Health Council Monitoring System and public minutes of the Federal District Health Council were collected, dispensing with approval by the Ethics Committee. The Federal District Health Council is in agreement to what was stated in Resolution 453/2012 of the National Health Council. We analyzed 43 minutes, generating two categories and five classes. It was concluded that the Federal District Health Council originated the reform of Primary Health Care during the study period, through the publication of a resolution that established guidelines for the reorganization of the primary care level.
