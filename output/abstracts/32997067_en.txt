To analyze the relationship between health conditions and weight changes among elderly people monitored by the SABE Survey over a ten-year period in SÃ£o Paulo/SP. This was a longitudinal study that followed (2000-baseline, 2006 and 2010) change in body weight (outcome variable) and associated health conditions (exposure variables) in the elderly (n=571); multinomial logistic regression analyses were employed. Average weight increase in the evaluated period was 29.0%. 34.0% (2006) and 12.5% (2010) lost weight and 18.2% (2006) and 39.9% (2010) gained weight. Prevalence of chronic diseases increased from 34.1% (2000) to 51.9% (2006) and 60.1% (2010). Older people with weight gain also rated their overall health as poorer in 2006 (RR:3.15; 95%CI 1.21;8.17) and 2010 (RR:2.46; 95%CI 1.02;5.94). The higher numbers of diseases (RR:2.12; 95%CI 1.00;4.46) and hospitalizations (RR:3.50; 95%CI 1.40;8.72) were associated with a decrease in weight in 2010. Weight changes are related to poorer health status among the elderly.
