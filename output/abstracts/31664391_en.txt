To verify the influence of physical performance on elderly mortality, functionality and life satisfaction. A follow-up was performed on 900 Brazilian non-hospitalized elderly in the period 2008-2016, in which 154 deaths from natural causes were included in the survival analysis. the worst grip strength (RR = 1.60; CI 95% = 1.15-2.23, p = 0.005) and gait speed (RR = 1.82; CI 95% = 1.30-2.55, p < 0.001) performances were associated with increased mortality risk. Age was a confounding factor for strength (RR = 1.06; CI 95%  =  1.03-1.09, p < 0.001) and rheumatoid arthritis was a confounding factor for speed (RR = 2.02; CI 95% = 1.36-3.01, p < 0.001). The elderly with good physical performance realized more instrumental and advanced activities of daily living, and good gait performance had a significant effect on life satisfaction (F = 6.87, p = 0.009). good physical performance seems to be fundamental for longevity and for accomplishing daily tasks. Furthermore, good mobility can affect life satisfaction-related mechanisms.
