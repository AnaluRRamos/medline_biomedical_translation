To analyze the number of hospital permits for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total hip arthroplasty (THA) in Brazil between 2008 and 2015, and correlate them with regional, national, and international demographic and epidemiological aspects. Data on demographics, economic level, and TKA and THA were obtained from the website of the Ministry of Health/DATASUS, Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, and the National Health Agency to assess the assistance provided by the Public Health Care System in arthroplasties for elderly Brazilian population without private health care. The South and Southeast had the best care, with 8.07 and 6.07 TKAs/100,000 inhabitants, one TKA per 1811 and 2624 seniors, 17.3 and 10.99 THAs/100,000 inhabitants, and one THA per 923 and 1427 seniors, respectively. The worst rates were found in the North and Northeast, with 0.88 and 0.98 TKAs/100,000, one TKA per 6930 and 10,411 seniors, 0.96 and 3.25 THAs/100,000, and one THA per 6849 and 2634 seniors, respectively. The national average was 4.00 TKAs/100,000, one TKA per 3249 seniors, 8.01 THAs/100,000, and one THA per 1586 seniors. The international average was 142.8 TKAs/100,000 and 191.8 THAs/100,000. The results expressed unsatisfactory results for TKA and THA in Brazil, with greater relevance in the North and Northeast.
