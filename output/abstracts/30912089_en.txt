To describe the immunological and hematological reference intervals of low-risk pregnant women.  A cross-sectional retrospective database analysis of a basic and translational study analyzing the hematological evaluation blood counts and immunophenotyping of TCD3 + , TCD4 + , TCD8 + , B, and natural killer (NK) cells of the peripheral blood in 79 low-risk pregnant women and of 30 control women from the state of Pernambuco, Brazil, was performed.  No significant differences were detected between the hematological profiles of the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> trimesters. Nevertheless, the median level of B cells decreased significantly in the 2<sup>nd</sup> (174 × 10<sup>3</sup> µL; <i>p</i> < 0.002) and 3<sup>rd</sup> trimesters (160 × 10<sup>3</sup> µL; <i>p</i> < 0.001), compared with the control group (296 × 10<sup>3</sup> µL). Similarly, the median level of NK cells was lower in the 2<sup>nd</sup> (134 × 10<sup>3</sup> µL; <i>p</i> < 0.0004) and 3<sup>rd</sup> trimesters (100 × 10<sup>3</sup> µL, <i>p</i> < 0.0004), compared with the control group (183 × 10<sup>3</sup> µL). In contrast, relative TCD4+ and TCD8+ levels increased in the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> trimesters compared with the controls (TCD4 + : 2<sup>nd</sup> trimester = 59%; <i>p</i> < 0.001; 3<sup>rd</sup> trimester = 57%; <i>p</i> < 0.01; control = 50%; and TCD8 + : 2<sup>nd</sup> trimester = 31%; <i>p</i> < 0.001; 3<sup>rd</sup> trimester = 36%; <i>p</i> < 0.01; control = 24%).  Low-risk pregnant women have ∼ 40% less B and NK cells in the peripheral blood, compared with non-pregnant women. These parameters may improve health assistance for mothers and contribute to define reference values for normal pregnancies.
