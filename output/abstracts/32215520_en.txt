The way old age was depicted during the 1930s, in Brazilian modernity, is investigated. A historical study was conducted using as its sources newspapers and magazines published in SÃ£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, as well as medical periodicals. It showed that the particularities and contradictions of Brazilian modernity contributed to a variety of representations of old age. The analysis of the documentary corpus failed to reveal a homogenous description of old age, but identified a considerable increase in the power of scientific and medical knowledge about behaviors considered adequate with regard to bodies in the 1930s.
