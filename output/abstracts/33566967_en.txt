Cardiomegaly on chest X-ray is an independent predictor of death in individuals with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC). However, the correlation between increased cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) on chest X-ray and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) on echocardiography is not well established in this population. To assess the relationship between chest X-ray and LVEDD on echocardiography in patients with Chagas disease and its applicability to the Rassi score. Retrospective study on 63 Chagas disease outpatients who underwent chest X-ray and echocardiography. Cardiomegaly on chest X-ray was defined as a CTR>0.5. LVEDD was analyzed as a continuous variable. ROC curve was used to evaluate the ability of LVEDD in detecting cardiomegaly by chest X-ray, with a cut-off point defined by the highest sum of sensitivity and specificity. Median age 61 years [interquartile range 48-68], 56% were women. CCC was detected in 58 patients, five patients had the indeterminate form of Chagas disease. Cardiomegaly was detected in 28 patients. The area under the ROC curve for LVEDD was 0.806 (95%CI: 0.692-0.919). The optimal cut-off for LVEDD was 60 mm (sensitivity = 64%, specificity = 89%). The use of LVEDD on echocardiography as a surrogate for CTR on chest X-ray changed the Rassi score values of 14 patients, with a reduction in the presumed risk in 10 of them. LVEDD on echocardiography is an appropriate, highly specific parameter to distinguish between the presence and absence of cardiomegaly on chest X-ray in Chagas disease.
