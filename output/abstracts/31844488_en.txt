Evidence on dementia in Latin America (LA) is limited and varies between and within countries, contributing to a delay in the establishment and implementation of dementia action plans by governments and services. The harmonization of standardised measurement outcomes and the use of unified databases that address the key issues affecting the LA population can help address this issue. This paper is based on a presentation delivered at a satellite Alzheimer's Association International Conference held in April 2019, in Brazil, and aims to discuss the challenges and benefits of harmonizing epidemiological studies on dementia in the region. First, we mention some of the characteristics of LA in relation to geography, population, socioeconomic and epidemiological conditions, which could potentially affect preventative measures and dementia diagnosis in the region. Second, we cite some studies to demonstrate how research on dementia in LA is limited and uses diverse methodology. We proceed by justifying the need for harmonization of epidemiological studies in LA and discuss what type of data could be harmonised. We conclude by briefly mentioning harmonization in relation to risk factors for dementia.
