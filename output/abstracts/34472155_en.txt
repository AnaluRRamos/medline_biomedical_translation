A 4-year-old, female spayed, domestic short hair cat presented with an acute eruption of pustules and bullous plaques after application of a plant-based, essential oil flea preventative. Histopathological evaluation of biopsies revealed severe neutrophilic infiltrate within the dermis and culture was negative. The cat's skin lesions responded rapidly to glucocorticoid monotherapy.
