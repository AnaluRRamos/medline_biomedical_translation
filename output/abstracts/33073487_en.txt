An enthesis refers to the interface at which a tendon or a ligament integrates into the periosteum. Its morphology can be influenced by intrinsic factors such as sex, age, and extrinsic factors such as levels of activity, which will in turn impact on bone remodeling and lead to morphological changes. In bioarcheology, entheseal changes have had a long tradition of being used for the reconstruction of past activities. The literature has shown that in some cases of osteoarthritis, entheseal changes are associated with osteoarthritic manifestations. This work aims to evaluate the relationship between the degree of entheseal changes and the severity of osteodegenerative processes. The studied materials consisted of 30 humeri and 30 femora from the osteological collection at St George's University of London. Intensities of both entheseal changes and osteodegenerative processes were macroscopically assessed and scored. The difference in scores of entheseal changes between osteoarthritic groups and nonosteoarthritic groups is statistically significant at a confidence level of 95% (α = .05) for both the humeri and femora. Results show a positive correlation between the degree of entheseal changes and the severity of osteodegenerative processes in the femora, suggesting that enthesis may play a role in osteoarthritis. Findings from this work supports the proposed hypothesis that the degree of entheseal changes and the severity of osteoarthritic manifestation are related. This work contributes to current knowledge that osteoarthritis is a disease involving the whole joint; the enthesis could potentially be a target for the diagnosis of osteoarthritis.
