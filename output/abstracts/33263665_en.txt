To describe the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics and those related to the sexual life, and to identify sexual dysfunction in women after cervical cancer treatment. Cross-sectional study including women aged ≥18 years and completion of the three-month treatment. Two instruments were used: form with sociodemographic, clinical and sexual life-related information; and the Female Sexual Function Index to assess the sexual function of sexually active participants, with score values ≤26 classified as sexual dysfunction. Descriptive statistics was used to check associations through the Mann-Whitney test and Pearson's chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. Out of a total of 46 women, 15 (32.61%) had sexual intercourse after treatment and eight had an indication of sexual dysfunction (score 21.66; standard deviation=7.06). The types of treatment (p=0.03) and of radiotherapy (p=0.01), in addition to the staging of the disease (p=0.02) interfered with the sexual function. The most affected domains of the Female Sexual Function Index were lubrication (p=0.03) and pain (p=0.04). Sexual dysfunction was present in women studied and had a negative impact on quality of life.
