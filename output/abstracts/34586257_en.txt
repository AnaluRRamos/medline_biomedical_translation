This paper aims to identify the conditions and trends in access and use of primary health care (PHC) services by Brazilian older adults in 2008, 2013, and 2019. We performed a cross-sectional panel study with a descriptive analysis of the percentages and confidence intervals of the variables listed, in which data on the elderly population investigated in the Health Supplement of the 2008 National Household Sample Survey (PNAD) and the 2013 and 2019 National Health Surveys (PNS) were obtained. We initially identified that, while PHC was the primary service sought for care needs, this demand tended to decline in all Brazilian regions, among older women, the 60-69 years age group, and whites. The number of households registered with the USF increased 15.2%; the search for a place, service, or health professional by 4.5%; and the population served by 31.4%. The main factors of non-attendance were not being able to get a vacancy/service ticket and doctor unavailability. A growing trend was observed among those diagnosed with Systemic Arterial Hypertension, Diabetes Mellitus, and multimorbidities among those investigated.
