Several cases of bilateral diffuse pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) or tenosynovial giant cell tumor have been described in the literature. Nevertheless, some presentations are rare and differential diagnoses are necessary. The purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review of the literature related to PVNS and to report a rare supra-patellar bilateral and focal presentation. We performed a systematic data review in the Pubmed Clinical Queries database using MeSH and keywords related to PVNS and tenosynovial giant cell tumor. Two cases of bilateral and local PVNS had been previously described, but neither was localized in the supra-patellar compartment. To our knowledge, this case report is the first to describe supra-patellar bilateral and localized PVNS of the knee. This case involves a 28 -year-old woman with bilateral localized PVNS of the supra-patellar recess of the knee. MRI showed a low-signal intensity nodule in T1- and T2-weighted images. These were associated with hemosiderin pigmentation. The most important finding of the case reported is related to rarity and location. Histopathology analysis confirmed a rare case of hemosiderin pigmentation in the capsular nodule with internal non-pigmented villous content. Lipoma arborescens in the supra-patellar form must be ruled out as a differential diagnosis since it occurs in the same site. <i><b>Level of Evidence IV; Case series.</b></i>
