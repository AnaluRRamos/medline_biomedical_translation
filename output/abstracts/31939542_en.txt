The study's objective was to discuss public policies for drug abuse prevention targeted to young people in Brazil and the United States. Brazil has formulated its policy with programs that are questioned at the international level on epistemological, theoretical, and methodological grounds. The authors conclude that social policymaking in Latin America is still permeated by dependence on central countries, since the tension between the prohibitionist and harm reduction policies persists in the policy provisions for drug abuse prevention under the National Secretariat for Drug Policies and the Ministry of Health and what is actually implemented. The article suggests pursuing autonomy vis-Ã -vis the models for preventive measures imposed by the dominant countries, through a wider debate between researchers, health professionals, users, and social movements in the leadership of more appropriate policies for Brazil.
