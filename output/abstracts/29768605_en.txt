Obese individuals are often blamed for their own condition and the targets of discrimination and prejudice. The scope of this study is to describe the cross-cultural adaptation to Brazilian Portuguese and the validation of the Antifat Attitudes Test - specifically developed for evaluation of negative attitudes toward the obese individual. The scale has 34 statements distributed in three subscales - Social/Character Disparagement (15 items), Physical/Romantic Unattractiveness (10 items) and Weight Control/Blame (9 items). The method involved the translation of the scale; evaluation of the conceptual, operational and item equivalence; evaluation of the semantic equivalence using the paired t test, the Pearson correlation coefficient and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC); internal consistency evaluation (Cronbach's alpha) and test-retest reliability (ICC) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis - after application in 340 college students in the area of health. The results showed good global internal consistency and reliability (Î± 0.85; CCI 0.83), and factor analysis showed that the original subscales can be kept in the adaptation, and therefore the scale adapted to the Brazilian-Portuguese version is valid and useful in studies to explore negative attitudes toward obese individuals.
