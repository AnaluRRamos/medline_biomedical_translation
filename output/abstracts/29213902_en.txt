Previous studies support that regular physical activity in aging contributes as a protective factor against cognitive decline and improves mood states. However, there is a lack of longitudinal studies in this area. To observe possible changes in cognition related with physical activity. This study reassessed, after one-year period, 31 elderly women divided into two groups, sedentary <i>versus</i> active, using behavioral scales and cognitive tests. The active group exhibited significantly enhanced performance in general cognitive function, particularly on tasks of episodic memory and praxis, and also on the mood states scale compared to the sedentary group. The active women also reported higher self-efficacy. Long-term physical activity promoted improvement on quality of life in the elderly women.
