Considering the variety of mechanisms of Herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) contamination and its broad invasive potential of the nervous system, a life-long latent infection is established. Infected adult individuals may be susceptible to viral reactivation when under the influence of multiple stressors, especially regarding immunocompromised patients. This guides a series of neuroinflammatory events on the cerebral cortex, culminating, rarely, in encephalitis and cytotoxic / vasogenic brain edema. A sum of studies of such processes provides an explanation, even though not yet completely clarified, on how the clinical evolution to cognitive impairment and dementia might be enabled. In addition, it is of extreme importance to recognize the current dementia and cognitive deficit worldwide panorama. The aim of this literature review is to elucidate the available data upon the pathophysiology of HSV-1 infection as well as to describe the clinical panorama of the referred afflictions.
