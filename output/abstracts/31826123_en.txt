Mammography is the main screening test for early detection of breast cancer; however, its access is not equal for all women in Brazil. The objective of this study was to analyze the factors associated with not having this examination done in a period of less than two years in Brazil and according to macro-region, considering sociodemographic characteristics, health conditions, lifestyle, and the use of health services. Cross-sectional study using data from the National Health Survey in Brazil (Pesquisa Nacional de Saúde - PNS). The sample consisted of 10,571 women (≥40 years old) living in all Brazilian regions. Poisson regression model with hierarchical approach was used to estimate prevalence ratios. The characteristics associated with not getting a mammogram were: age ≥60 years, low schooling, living without a partner, negative health self-rating, having some chronic disease, no regular exercise, not getting a clinical breast examination for up to one year or a Pap smear for up to three years, not seeing a doctor in the last year, not having health insurance, feeling discriminated by a health professional, and being enrolled in a family care unit. Sociodemographic factors were prominent in the North and Northeast, while in other regions, health conditions and health behavior were predominant. Variables related to the use of health services were especially important in not getting a mammogram. Measures should be taken in each macro-region of Brazil to reduce disparities in access to mammography.
