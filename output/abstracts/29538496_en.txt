The aim of this study was to estimate the contribution of the effect of age, period, and birth cohort on mortality from colorectal cancer. The study analyzed data on deaths from this cancer in individuals over 35 years of age in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil, obtained from the Mortality Information System (SIM) from 1980 to 2014. Mortality rates were calculated by gender and age bracket. The effect of age, period, and birth cohort was estimated by the method that uses estimable functions: deviations, curves, and drift in the Epi library of the R software. Standardized mortality rates from colorectal cancer were 27.37/100,000 men and 21.83/100,000 women in 2014. The data showed an increase in mortality from this cancer from 1980 to 2014, and mortality rates were higher in men than in women after the 1990s. Age effect was observed with an increase in the rates and aging. Generational analysis showed lower risk of death in older versus younger cohorts, possibly related to the adoption of the Western lifestyle. This scenario underscores the need for screening strategies aimed at early diagnosis and treatment of precursor lesions.
