Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorder, which can affect all members of a society, regardless of age, sex, race or socioeconomic status. Because of its high prevalence and chronic nature, it represents a significant economic burden. In fact, these patients have a relevant impairment of their quality of life, which limits their work productivity and daily social activities, especially when it is associated with other disorders, such as anxiety and depression. The diagnosis of IBS relies on symptom-based diagnostic criteria with normal results on a limited number of complementary tests that rule out other possible diagnoses. The aetiology of this condition is incompletely established. However, evidence suggests that it is a multifactorial disorder with several different mechanisms that have been implicated as responsible for the symptoms. Since the treatment strategy is usually based on predominant symptoms and their severity, it is important to recognise the underlying mechanisms in order to successfully relief the visceral pain and altered bowel habits. The aim of this non-systematic review of the literature was to explore the pathophysiology and treatment options of IBS, highlighting the most recent evidence, from the new Rome IV criteria to the new drug armamentarium.
