Inflammatory bowel disease may cause both intestinal and extraintestinal manifestations. Respiratory symptoms in ulcerative colitis are rare and tracheal involvement is exceedingly rare in children. Sixteen year-old female with a 4-week-complaint of abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, fever and cough. The investigation was consistent with the diagnosis of concomitant ulcerative colitis/coinfection to <i>Escherichia coli</i>. On day 4 respiratory signs persisted so azithromycin and inhaled corticosteroids were added. By day 6 she progressed to respiratory failure and was diagnosed with necrotic tracheitis so started on intravenous steroids with fast clinical improvement. Twelve-year-old male adolescent with ulcerative colitis and sclerosing cholangitis started dry cough and throat pain 10 days after diagnosis. Laboratory investigations showed increased inflammatory signs and normal chest X-ray. He started treatment with azithromycin without clinical improvement and on day five he presented dyspnea and fever. Laryngeal fibroscopy suggested tracheitis and so systemic steroids where added with fast clinical and analytic improvement. Tracheitis should be suspected if there are persistent respiratory symptoms even when exams are normal. Early recognition and early treatment are essential for a good prognosis preventing progression to respiratory failure.
