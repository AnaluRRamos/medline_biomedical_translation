To identify risk factors related to postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) and severe PPH with blood loss quantified objectively.  This is a complementary analysis of a prospective cohort study that included pregnant women delivering vaginally. The total blood loss was obtained through the sum of the volume collected from the drape with the weight of gauzes, compresses and pads used by women within 2 hours. Exploratory data analysis was performed to assess mean, standard deviation (SD), frequency, percentage and percentiles. The risk factors for postpartum bleeding were evaluated using linear and logistic regression.  We included 270 women. The mean blood loss at 120 minutes was 427.49 mL (±335.57 mL). Thirty-one percent (84 women) bled > 500 mL and 8.2% (22 women) bled > 1,000 mL within 2 hours. Episiotomy, longer second stage of labor and forceps delivery were related to blood loss > 500 mL within 2 hours, in the univariate analysis. In the multivariate analysis, only forceps remained associated with bleeding > 500 mL within 2 hours (odds ratio [OR] = 9.5 [2.85-31.53]). Previous anemia and episiotomy were also related to blood loss > 1,000mL.  Prolonged second stage of labor, forceps and episiotomy are related to increased incidence of PPH, and should be used as an alert for the delivery assistants for early recognition and prompt treatment for PPH.
