Aging should not be seen as a hindrance to the continuity of work, while including older adults in the labor market contributes to national economies. To analyze the association between subjective quality of life (QoL) assessment, sociodemographic variables and self-reported morbidity among working older adults. The present study was conducted at farmers' markets in Presidente Prudente, Sao Paulo, Brazil. Participants were 24 older adults aged 68.69Â±6.5 years old. We administered the World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-bref) questionnaire, a sociodemographic questionnaire including working conditions and a questionnaire to survey the participants' medical history. The normality assumption was assessed with the Shapiro-Wilk test. Pearson's and Spearman's tests were used for correlation analysis. The sample exhibited average QoL. Most participants were female, with 1 to 8 years of formal schooling, married, with family income 1 to 3 times the equivalent of the minimum wage and sought healthcare within the national health system. All the participants lived in their own house. Hypertension was the most prevalent disease. QoL and morbidity exhibited moderate negative correlation. There was negative correlation between the QoL physical and psychological domains and variables years in the job, daily working hours, meal/rest breaks and number of meals/day. There was moderate negative correlation between the QoL environment domain and meal/rest breaks.
