This study aimed to investigate, using the PINT Brasil, the influence of the interstimulus interval on the performance of children with moderate and severe hearing loss fitted with hearing aids. Ten children with normal hearing (CG) and 20 children with hearing loss (SG) participated in the study. Both groups were assessed using the speech perception test called PINT Brasil in PAUSE and NO PAUSE situations. When comparing the PAUSE and NO PAUSE situations, only the SG presented a statistically significant difference, indicating that the NO PAUSE situation had the best performance. In this situation, the noise oscillations were smaller, and the noise reduction algorithm, which may cause the loss of message information, was not repeatedly activated. The interstimulus interval in the PINT Brasil influenced the performance of children with moderate and severe hearing loss fitted with hearing aids. The NO PAUSE situation presented the best results.
