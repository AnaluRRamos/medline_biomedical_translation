To evaluate the main technical limitations of automated breast ultrasound and to determine the proportion of examinations excluded. We evaluated 440 automated breast ultrasound examinations performed, over a 12-month period, by technicians using an established protocol. In five cases (1.1%), the examination was deemed unacceptable for diagnostic purposes, those examinations therefore being excluded. Automated breast ultrasound is expected to overcome some of the major limitations of conventional ultrasound in breast cancer screening. In Brazil, this new method can be accepted for inclusion in routine clinical practice only after its advantages have been validated in the national context.
