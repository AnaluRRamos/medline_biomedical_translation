One of the major challenges the European colonizers faced in sixteenth-century Portuguese America was adaptation to their new environment, especially nutritional obstacles. Obtaining the human body's daily calorie requirements may have been one of the more strenuous tasks in colonial dynamics.

Our goal is to highlight the importance of colonial sweets, identify how they were consumed, and show the relationship between this activity and the medical discourse which was present in sixteenth-century Europe.
