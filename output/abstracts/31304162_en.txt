Analyzed the association of bone mass with the functional capacity of elderly aged 80 or more. The sample consisted of 93 elderly aged 80 and 91 years (83.2±2.5 years) being 61 women (83.3±2.7 years) and 32 men (83.1±2.2 years) living in the city of Presidente Prudente - São Paulo/Brazil. The assessment of bone mass was realized by absorptiometry dual-energy X-ray (DXA), where have been measured values bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD) of the femur and spine (L1-L4). The functional capacity was evaluated by means of walking speed tests, static equilibrium and strength of lower limbs contained in the questionnaire Wellness Health and Aging (SABE). The variables of bone mass and functional capacity were categorized according to the median values and score tests, respectively. For statistical analysis we carried out the chi-square test, the software used was SPSS (13.0) and the significance level was set at 5%. Elderly male with higher performance in the functional tests showed higher femur BMC compared to lower performance, result not found when evaluated women. Thus, the bone of the femur for the oldest old male is associated with functional capacity. The constant assessment of the bone mineral mass and practive of physical activity throughout life would be measures to prevent falls in the elderly.
