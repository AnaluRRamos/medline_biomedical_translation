Acute pulmonary embolism (APE) has a variable clinical outcome. Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is the gold standard for this diagnosis. To evaluate if the pulmonary vascular volume (PVV) quantified by automated software is a mortality predictor after APE. Retrospective cohort study where the CTPA imaging of 61 patients with APE was reanalyzed. Pulmonary vascular volume (PVV) and pulmonary volume (PV) were automatically estimated using the Yacta software. We calculated the adjusted PVV by the ratio: PVV(cm<sup>3</sup>)/PV(liters). Classical prognostic CTPA parameters (clot load index, right ventricle/left ventricle diameter ratio, pulmonary artery/aorta diameter ratio, ventricular septal bowing, pulmonary infarction and reflux of contrast into the hepatic vein) were assessed. The outcome assessed was one-month mortality. We considered a p-value <0.05 as statistically significant. Seven deaths (11%) occurred at one month among these 61 patients. PVV<23cm<sup>3</sup>/L was an independent predictor of one-month mortality in the univariate [odds ratio (OR): 26; 95% confidence interval (CI): 3-244; p=0.004] and multivariate analyses [adjusted OR: 19; 95%CI: 1.3-270; p=0.03]. The classical CTPA parameters were not associated with one-month mortality in this sample. The PVV<23cm<sup>3</sup>/L showed a sensitivity of 86%, a specificity of 82%, a negative predictive value of 94% and a positive predictive value of 64% to identify the patients who died. PVV<23cm<sup>3</sup>/L was an independent predictor of one-month mortality after APE. This parameter showed better prognostic performance than other classical CTPA findings.
