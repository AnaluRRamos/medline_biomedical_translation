To evaluate tendencies in the planning, diagnosis, and treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) by Brazilian hand surgery specialists. This cross-sectional study was performed at the 36th Brazilian Hand Surgery Congress. We prepared a questionnaire about preferences in the management of CTS, and board-certified hand surgeons that attended the congress were asked to fill out the questionnaires. A total of 174 questionnaires were analyzed. Electromyography examination is used by most surgeons. Night splinting is the most commonly used conservative treatment option. Half of the surgeons utilized prophylactic antibiotics. Most of the interviewees conduct inpatient surgery in the operating room and prefer intravenous regional anesthesia. Most of surgeons use the standard open technique associated with proximal release of the antebrachial fascia and do not perform neurolysis. Compressive dressings are most commonly used for 7 days. The approach to CTS among Brazilian hand surgeons with regard to pre-, intra-, and post-operatory conduct is consistent with the international literature. However, there is a need to reflect and conduct new studies on non-surgical treatment involving local corticosteroid injection, use of prophylactic antibiotics, hospital admission, and type of anesthesia in order to provide more cost-effective approach to surgical treatment for CTS. Level of Evidence V; Expert opinion.
