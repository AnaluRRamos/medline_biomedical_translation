To analyze the characteristics of patients diagnosed with pediatric osteoarticular infections treated in a level III trauma center in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. We retrospectively analyzed patients admitted between September 2012 and August 2014. The outcomes analyzed were: age, sex, diagnosis, etiologic agent, anatomic location, time to diagnosis, history of previous trauma and infection, laboratory tests, treatment, and complications. Twenty patients were included, 50% with septic arthritis, 35% with osteomyelitis, and 15% with both. Boys were predominant (80%), and the mean age was 6.6 years. The most common etiologic agent was <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. C-reactive protein value and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were elevated. The infections were treated with antibiotic therapy (intravenous and oral) and oxacillin was most frequently used. Most patients underwent at least one surgical procedure, and 35% of patients had complications. This epidemiological mapping identified clinical and demographic characteristics which are useful for improving preparation for care. Future prospective studies with longer patient follow-up and the development of treatment protocols are needed to improve therapeutic decision-making and the prognosis of children with suspected osteoarticular infections. <i><b>Evidence Level II; Prognostic studies - Investigation of the effect of patient characteristics on the outcome of the disease.</b></i>
