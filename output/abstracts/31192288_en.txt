Drug-induced liver injury is an increasingly prevalent consequence of the diversification of available therapeutic weapons, mostly idiosyncratic and with several possible mechanisms and patterns of specific damage for each drug. Carvedilol, a widely used non-selective alpha and beta blocker leads, in very rare cases, to injury of the bile ducts by toxic metabolites, resulting in a mixed-pattern hepatitis with possible progression to chronic cholestatic syndrome and cirrhosis. The authors report the second known case of this important toxicity. An 83-year-old woman was admitted to the Internal Medicine ward for etiological clarification of a mixed-pattern hepatitis. Clinical history was unremarkable and structural, infectious, and autoimmune causes were excluded by blood tests and imaging exams, ultimately leading to the diagnosis of toxic hepatitis that was further confirmed by liver biopsy with morphologic findings of mixed-pattern liver injury. Carvedilol, started 6 months before, was deemed the causal agent since it was the only drug with a clinically, temporally, analytically, and histologically compatible pattern. The withdrawal of the drug resulted in slow reversal of the referred abnormalities. In very rare cases, carvedilol can cause important liver toxicity as a chronic cholestatic syndrome which can evolve to cirrhosis. It should be taken in consideration as causal agent in similar cases and stopped immediately upon suspicion, as the timely withdrawal results in reversion of the pathological findings.
