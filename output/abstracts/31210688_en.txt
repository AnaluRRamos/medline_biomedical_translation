To emphasize the most appropriate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) diffusion protocol for the detection of lesions that cause transient global amnesia, in order to perform an accurate examination, as well as to determine the ideal time point after the onset of symptoms to perform the examination. We evaluated five patients with a diagnosis of transient global amnesia treated between 2012 and 2015. We analyzed demographic characteristics, clinical data, symptom onset, diffusion techniques, and radiological findings. Examination techniques included a standard diffusion sequence (b value = 1000 s/mm<sup>2</sup>; slice thickness = 5 mm) and a optimized diffusion sequence (b value = 2000 s/mm<sup>2</sup>; slice thickness = 3 mm). Brain MRI was performed at 24 h or 36 h after symptom onset, except in one patient, in whom it was performed at 12 h after (at which point no changes were seen) and repeated at 36 h after symptom onset (at which point it showed alterations in the right hippocampus). The standard and optimized diffusion sequences were both able to demonstrate focal changes in the hippocampi in all of the patients but one, in whom the changes were demonstrated only in the optimized sequence. MRI can confirm a clinical hypothesis of transient global amnesia. Knowledge of the optimal diffusion parameters and the ideal timing of diffusion-weighted imaging (> 24 h after symptom onset) are essential to improving diagnostic efficiency.
