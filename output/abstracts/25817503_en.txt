Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis constitute a major threat to worldwide tuberculosis control. The treatment demands the use of a therapeutic regimen in second-line drugs for a minimum period of 20 months, which includes aminoglycosides over a period of about eight months. These are associated with permanent cochleovestibular changes. This cross-sectional study aims to evaluate the auditory function in individuals who completed treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (with scheme that included aminoglycosides) at the Center of Regional Reference for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis located in the North of Portugal, between the years 2009 and 2012. Patients who met the inclusion criteria were submitted to tonal and vocal audiograms, otoacoustic emissions at 2000-5000 Hz frequencies, and a tympanogram. Between 2009 and 2012, 27 patients were referred to the Centre of Regional Reference for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, in the North Region of Portugal, resulting in five deaths. Of the 22 individuals invited, 11 attended. These were aged between 31 and 59 years (41 Â± 10). Amikacin was used in 80% of patients. Six patients (60%) had sensorineural hearing loss. The results of this study suggest the need for a more frequent audiological monitoring in patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treated with aminoglycosides allowing early detect hearing loss.
