To analyze the maternal perception about the paternal care and to understand how this care Is made effective In practical actions in the care of the child/adolescent with chronic disease in the family routine. Exploratory-descriptive, qualitative study, carried out at the pediatric outpatient clinic of a public hospital in the state of Para√≠ba, between November/2013 and April/2014, with 10 mothers whose children had more than six months of diagnosis. Semi-structured interview subsidized the data collection, which was submitted to thematic analysis. Parents participated in activities such as routine care of the child, medication management, leisure, binomial support and household chores. They took on different roles in the care depending on the availability of time and the maternal freedom given for their participation. Among the separated couples, the distance between parents in the care reflected on the child's health. It is important to involve fathers in the care of the child with chronic diseases. However, there is a need for a greater involvement of fathers in the performance of this care.
