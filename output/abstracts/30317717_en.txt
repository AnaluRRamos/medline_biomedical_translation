The authors present the case of an elderly woman with multiple comorbidities hospitalized with the diagnosis of community- acquired pneumonia with pleural effusion. However, there was a history of fall with chest trauma 1 week before, coinciding with the onset of symptoms. The patient had a massive hemothorax that could not be drained. There was a progressive worsening of the patient clinical status with sustained fever and arising of inflammatory parameters, despite broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy and antipyretics. The case was discussed in a multidisciplinary team, and the possibility of surgical intervention was rejected. As life-saving therapy, it was decided to perform fibrinolysis with tissue plasminogen activator, through the thoracic drain, which occurred successfully and without complications. The hemothorax was drained completely allowing recovery of the patient.
