Evaluation of rheumatoid hand-associated metacarpophalangeal joint silicone arthroplasty most often relies on functional scores alone. This study aimed to understand the correlation between perceived and observed function, strength, and alignment. Cross-sectional study including all 11 women (15 hands) submitted to second to fifth metacarpophalangeal joint arthroplasty due to rheumatoid arthritis involvement for a time period of seven years. Measurements relied on the Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire, Lafayette Purdue Pegboard, pinch and grip strength, and analysis of a lateral 'OK-sign' X-ray view. Correlation analysis used Spearman's coefficient, assuming statistical significance for <i>p</i>-values < 0.05. Objective function was strongly correlated with all other variables (<i>p</i> < 0.05), while perceived function failed to correlate with articular alignment in both measurements (<i>p</i> = 0.240 and <i>p</i> = 0.354). Strength and alignment were also strongly correlated (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Most measurements strongly correlate with each other, with emphasis on objective dexterity measurement.
