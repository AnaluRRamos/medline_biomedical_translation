A ruptured descending thoracic aortic aneurysm (rDTAA) is a life-threatening condition associated with high morbidity and mortality. Endovascular treatment for rDTAA promotes effective aneurysm exclusion with a minimally invasive approach. The authors report a case of a 76-year-old man with hemodynamically unstable 9-cm-diameter rDTAA treated with emergency thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR).
