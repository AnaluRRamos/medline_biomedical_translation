To compare the evolution of asthma indicators in the editions of the National School Health Survey (PeNSE 2012 and 2015). Cross-sectional study including Brazilian 9th grade students from public and private schools. Wheezing was assessed through the question: 'In the past 12 months, did you have wheezing (or chirping) chest? (yes/no)', and to assess lifetime presence of asthma, the question was 'Have you ever had asthma? (yes/no)'. Of the students, 23,52% reported wheezing or chirping chest in the past 12 months, with prevalences ranging from 16,80% (in Salvador, Bahia) to 27,43% (in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul). Lifetime presence of asthma was reported by 17,92% of the students, ranging from 13,98% (in Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul) to 30,35% (in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul). There was also a decrease in the prevalence of self-report of wheezing/chirping chest in the last 12 months between the two editions of the survey (2012/2015) in 20 of the 27 Brazilian state capitals, especially in Belo Horizonte, Florianópolis, Cuiabá and Goiânia. However, prevalence of lifetime diagnostic of asthma increased from 2012 to 2015 in 26 of the 27 Brazilian state capitals. There was a decrease in the prevalence of self-report of asthma symptoms and an increase of self-reported lifetime presence of asthma. Certainly, monitoring indicators of asthma prevalence is of high importance for health knowledge and the development of public policies.
