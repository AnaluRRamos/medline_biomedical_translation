Psychiatry is influenced by society changes, so it should be permanently updating itself, foreseeing future behaviours and pathologies. This study aims to describe psychiatry trainee's opinion in Portugal concerning their training and the modifications they would want to witness in the near future. A structured questionnaire of 26 questions was developed by the Portuguese Association of Psychiatry Trainees and sent via email. The percentage of responses was 41.5%. The majority of the trainees were satisfied with their formation. However, some changes were pointed out concerning obligatory and optional placements. Most trainees claimed psychotherapy should be included in their training, along with an easier access to investigational procedures and clinical training opportunities abroad. This detailed perspective can facilitate the transformation of the curricula throughout Portugal and Europe, allowing the improvement of psychiatry training, as well as the enhancement of mental health care.
