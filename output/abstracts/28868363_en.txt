Polyglandular syndrome is characterized by the association of autoimmune, organ-specific, endocrine and non-endocrine diseases. To present a case of polyglandular syndrome type III (b) accompanied by pernicious anemia and autoimmune thyroiditis. Report the clinical case of a young patient that developed progressive and disabling peripheral neuropathy framework, triggered by vitamin B12 deficiency. It was proven that atrophic gastritis with positive intrinsic anti-factor was responsible for the framework of pernicious anemia, which in turn dangerously reduced the serum levels of vitamin B12, leading to myelopathy. There was a progressive neurological improvement after parenteral cyanocobalamin replacement, keeping the patient at ambulatory, under maintenance therapy. The importance of suspecting on polyglandular syndrome in the presence of autoimmune frameworks is important, especially those involving diabetes, thyroiditis, atrophic gastritis, pernicious anemia, vitiligo, among others.
