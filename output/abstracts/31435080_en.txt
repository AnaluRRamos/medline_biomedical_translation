To assess the impact of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on the locoregional staging of breast cancer. We evaluated 61 patients with breast cancer who underwent pre-treatment breast MRI, between August 2015 and April 2016. An experienced breast surgeon determined the surgical treatment, on the basis of the findings of conventional imaging examinations, and made a subsequent treatment recommendation based on the MRI findings, then determining whether the MRI changed the approach, as well as whether it had a positive or negative impact on the treatment. The mean age was 50.8 years (standard deviation, 12.0 years). The most common histological type was invasive breast carcinoma of no special type (in 68.9%), and the most common molecular subtype was luminal B (in 45.9%). Breast MRI modified the therapeutic management in 23.0% of the cases evaluated, having a positive impact in 82.7%. Breast MRI is an useful tool for the locoregional staging of breast cancer, because it provides useful information that can have a positive impact on patient treatment.
