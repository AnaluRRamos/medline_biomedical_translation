This study aimed to develop an algorithm for downloading and preprocessing microdata furnished by the Brazilian Health Informatics Department (DATASUS) for various health information systems, using the R statistical programming language. The package allows downloading and preprocessing data from various health information systems, with the inclusion of labeling categorical fields in the files. The download function was capable of directly accessing and reducing the workload for the selection of microdata files and variables in DATASUS, while the preprocessing function enabled automatic coding of various categorical fields. The package thus enables a continuous workflow in the same program, in which the algorithm allows downloading and preprocessing and other packages in R allow analyzing data from the health information systems in the Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS).
