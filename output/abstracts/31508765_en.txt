This study evaluated the psychometric properties of the Brazilian version of the Sexually Transmitted Disease Knowledge Questionnaire (STD-KQ). A convenience sample of 429 students of a Brazilian public university participated in the study. Exploratory Factor Analysis suggested one factor solution (variance explained = 61.1%, eigenvalue = 7.2), confirmed by the confirmatory analysis (Root Mean Square Error of Approximation = 0.04; Comparative Fit Index = 0.91; Tucker-Lewis Index = 0.90; Standardized Root Mean Square Residual = 0.05). Five items feature charges less than 0.30 and wer eliminated. The instrument demonstrated internal consistency (Composite reliability = 0.97; Cronbach's alpha = 0.83) and temporal stability (Pearson correlation = 0.86; kappa = 0.16) over a brief period. The knowledge significantly varies by age, sex and course of study. In conclusion, this study highlights the satisfactory psychometric proprieties of the Brazilian version of STD-KQ in university students.
