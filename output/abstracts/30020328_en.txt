To know the perception of users on self-care of ulcers in the lower limbs. This is a qualitative, exploratory, and descriptive study conducted with 10 users registered in the complementary programme of a wound care clinic in Canoas, RS, Brazil. Data were collected using information from the medical records of the users and semi-structured interviews conducted between October and November 2016. The results were discussed according to thematic content analysis with three thematic categories: self-care and living with the ulcer, self-care deficit and supporting users with ulcer, and self-care and the ulcer care network, based on the Nursing Self-Care Deficit Theory. Self-care is the result of dialogue between the user/nurse/health workers and the link they establish when they share care. The support of family members and the service can facilitate or limit care.
