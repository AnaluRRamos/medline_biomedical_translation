To develop and validate an instrument to assess the knowledge of nurses on enteral nutrition. Methodological study, with literature review, content validation and pre-test. Studies published from 2008 to 2018 on enteral nutrition were included in the review. The material was evaluated by 6 judges, following psychometric criteria. The degree of agreement was calculated. The pre-test was carried out with 30 nurses, with the objective of verifying the suitability and understanding of the instrument for its use in clinical practice. The instrument constructed had four domains with 10 items each. The domains Indication of enteral nutrition and Monitoring of enteral nutrition had better degrees of agreement -0.94 and 0.93, respectively. The categories that obtained values below 0.90 were reformulated or removed, resulting in 38 categories distributed in 4 domains. In the pre-test, the agreement was 0.90, and the instrument was considered easy to understand and adequate for practice. The instrument constructed was validated regarding content and application in nursing practice.
