To verify the association between obesity and demographic, clinical and lifestyle variables in climacteric women, a cross-sectional study was conducted in outpatient clinics, with 469 women aged 40 to 65 years in the city of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. The dependent variables were: obesity according to body mass index (BMI) and obesity according to percentage of body fat (% BF). The main explanatory variable was: climacteric phase (pre or postmenopausal); and control variables were: age; years of formal study; parity; menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) use; physical activity practice and smoking habit. Multiple regression analysis was performed using the Stata 9.2 software. According to the BMI, obesity was positively associated with parity (RR = 1.62, 95% CI = 1.11-2.37) and, negatively, with years of formal study (RP = 0.71, CI 95% = 0.55-0.91) and with physical activity practice (PR = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.33-0.61). According to the % BF, obesity was positively associated with parity (PR = 1.60, 95% CI = 1.03-2.49) and negatively with physical activity practice (PR = 0.43; 95% CI = 0.29-0.63). While being active physically was protective, multiparity was a risk factor for developing obesity for women in this study.
