To clinically and radiologically evaluate patients who received meniscal suture using the outside-in technique, comparing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), arthro-magnetic resonance imaging (arthro-MRI), and arthro-computed tomography (arthro-CT) to evaluate the healing of meniscal sutures. We evaluated eight patients with an average follow-up of 15 months. The evaluation analyzed clinical parameters using the Lysholm and IKDC scores as well as MRI, arthro-MRI, and arthro-CT imaging. At the end of the follow-up period, mean Lysholm score was 89.5 and mean IKDC score was 78.6. In the MRI, signs of meniscal healing were observed in 50% of the cases. The arthro-MRI and arthro-CT showed signs of healing in 75% of cases. There was a positive correlation between arthro-MRI and arthro-CT results in all the cases studied (kappa correlation index=1). Meniscal suture using the outside-in technique presented good or excellent results in 87.5% of our patients. The arthro-CT and arthro-MRI showed the same level of accuracy in detecting healing of the sutured region of the meniscus. <b><i>Level of Evidence IV; Case series.</i></b>
