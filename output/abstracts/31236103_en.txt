Primary vasculitides are diseases with a wide variety of anatomical, clinical, radiological, and laboratory presentations. Primary vasculitides are difficult to diagnose because of the complexity of clinical presentation, which may lead to delayed treatment and increased financial costs of workup investigations involving non-essential tests. Our objective in the present study is to create an algorithm that helps diagnosis of Primary vasculitides. The algorithm presented in this article allows fast, simple and cost-effective diagnosis of primary vasculitides using just clinical concepts and a few laboratory tests.
