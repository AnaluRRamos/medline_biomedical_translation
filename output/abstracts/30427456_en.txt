This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and distribution profile of malocclusion in Brazilian preschoolers and its association with macro-region, housing, gender, and self-reported race. In total, 6,855 children aged five years participating in the National Oral Health Survey (called SB Brasil 2010) were analyzed. Malocclusion was diagnosed according to the Foster and Hamilton index. We conducted descriptive, bivariate and multiple regression analyses (PR/CI95%). We identified that 63.2% of children had at least one of the occlusal problems evaluated: canines' key (22.9%), overjet (32.9%), overbite (34.6%), and posterior crossbite (18.7%) and, thus, were considered with malocclusion. Higher probability of the presence of malocclusion was identified among the residents of the Midwest (1.08/95%CI 1.01-1.15), Northeast (1.21/95%CI 1.14-1.28), Southeast (1.27/95%CI 1.20-1.34) and South (1.34/95%CI 1.26-1.42) regions when compared to residents in the North. It was also higher among female children (1.06/95% CI 1.02-1.09). No associations were identified concerning race and location of the municipality (capital/no capital). A high prevalence of malocclusion was identified in Brazilian preschoolers, and it was associated with gender and the macro-region. These findings may contribute to expanded public policies and greater access to treatment for this population.
