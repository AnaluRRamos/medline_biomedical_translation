This article analyzes the social and cultural dimensions of food addressed in the dietary guidelines of the second edition of the Dietary Guideline for the Brazilian Population (DGBP) in contrast to its first edition. This is a qualitative study. We employ the Pecheutian discourse analysis. The study universe is the first and second edition of DGBP. Data analysis used three steps: identification of similar and different texts of these materials; elucidation of the social and cultural dimensions of food in these materials; and systematic analysis with contrasting emerging discourses in both DGBPs. We emphasize that in the second edition the theoretical references-epidemiological, clinical, sociological, anthropological studies, and popular knowledge-and the use of the NOVA food classification favored the development of more holistic dietary guidelines that address food and eating patterns, culinary practices, the act of eating and the commensality. It is concluded that the second editions of DGPB allows health professionals and the population an understanding of food as something concrete in the life of individuals and collectivity, extrapolating its physiological and biological dimension.
