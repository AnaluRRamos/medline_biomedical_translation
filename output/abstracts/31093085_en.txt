To describe the estimated prevalence of noncommunicable diseases and their common risk factors among the adult population of Curitiba, Paraná, Brazil, based on results of the EPIdemiology of CURitiba: EvaluAtion of Noncommunicable diseases (EPICUREAN) study. This was a cross-sectional, population-based survey of 1 103 residents of Curitiba, grouped by age (18 - 39 years of age, 40 - 59, and ≥ 60 years), conducted in August 2013 - August 2014. Household interviews, anthropometry, blood pressure measurements, and fasting capillary glycemia were performed during two visits to each participant. The analyses included frequency distribution and prevalence estimates of main outcomes. Prevalence estimates, weighted by age and sex, were presented as absolute numbers and percentages. Prevalence estimates for self-reported depression were 21.2%; hypertension, 31.2%; diabetes, 9.1%; self-reported dyslipidemia, 21.7%; obesity, 21.2%; current smoking, 16.1%; binge drinking, 23.4%; and insufficient physical activity, 35.1%. Prevalences of diabetes and hypertension were higher among individuals with less schooling and the elderly. Binge drinking and leisure-time physical activity were more prevalent in young adults. Men presented higher prevalences of overweight, current smoking, and harmful use of alcohol. Obesity and moderate- to-severe risk of depression were more frequent among women and those with lower income. The prevalence of NCDs and common risk factors among the adult population of Curitiba are high and reveal a gradient of vulnerabilities by age, sex, education level, and income. To address health inequities and meet the needs of different population groups, the health system should monitor NCDs and risk factors and implement equitable public health policies.
