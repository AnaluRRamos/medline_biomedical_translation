This study aimed to investigate changes in the health service use pattern based on information from the 2013 and 2019 National Health Surveys (PNS). The two outcomes, 'Seeking health-related care in the past two weeks' and 'Medical visit in the last twelve months', were analyzed according to socioeconomic, geographic and health conditions characteristics. Multivariate Poisson regression models were used to investigate the factors associated with seeking care due to a health problem or prevention. The prevalence of chronic diseases increased from 15.0% to 22.5% between 2013 and 2019. The proportion of seeking care increased from 15.3 to 18.6%, and medical visits from 71.2% to 76.2%, ranging from 61.4 to 75.8% and 68.0 to 80.6% between the North and Southeast regions. There was no significant association of seeking care due to a health problem with per capita income, after controlling for the other covariates. We conclude by saying that, despite the expanded coverage of health service use, the persistent regional inequalities indicate unmet health needs among residents of the less developed regions. Health care models focused on prevention and health promotion are required.
