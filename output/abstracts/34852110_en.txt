The objective of this study was to establish the quantity and variety of fruit and vegetables (FV) available in Brazilian households in 2008-09 and 2017-18, and according to regions and income classes in 2017-18. Data from the Household Budget Surveys were used regarding household availability of fruit and vegetables. The annual per capita amount of each food item purchased was transformed into daily amounts. The absolute (gram/per capita/day) and the relative average quantities of each type of FV in Brazil (in both periods), and according to region and income (in 2017-18), were analyzed. An insufficient quantity of fruit and vegetables purchased in Brazil (54.4 g and 42.7 g in 2008-09; 49.7 g and 37.4 g in 2017-18, respectively) in all regions and income classes was verified. The South represented the highest amount purchased, while the North revealed the lowest; the quantity of FV increased as income increased. Six varieties of fruit (banana, apple, plantain, orange, watermelon, and papaya) and three types of vegetables (tomato, onion, and carrot) represented more than 50% of the total acquisition in Brazil, which was similar for all strata analyzed. The acquisition of fruit and vegetables in Brazil was low and featured little variation. This scenario was the same for all regions and income brackets.
