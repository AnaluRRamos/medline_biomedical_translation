The aim was to evaluate the prevalence of utilization of prenatal oral health services and its associated factors, through data from Cycle I (2011-12) and II (2013-14) of PMAQ-AB. This was cross-sectional study with 4,340 women (Cycle I) and 6,209 women (Cycle II), with outcome of utilization oral health service in prenatal care. Multilevel Poisson regression was used for obtain prevalence ratios (PR). In Cycle I, the prevalence of prenatal oral health service utilization was 45.9% and 51.9% in cycle II. In cycle I, large municipalities (PR = 1.35; 95%CI 1.05-1.81), income ranging from 1 to 2 minimum wages (PR = 1.13; 95%CI 1.03-1.25), age ranging from 31 to 40 years old (PR = 1.33, 95%CI 1.15-1.54) and registry of dental appointments (PR = 1.17; 95%CI 1.06-1.29) they were associated with the outcome. In cycle II, southeast region (PR = 1.18; 95%CI 1.03-1.36), high oral healthcare coverage (PR = 1.11; 95%CI 1.01-1.22), age ranging from 31 to 40 years old (PR = 1.22; 95%CI 1.09-1.36), the health workers enrollment in permanent education actions (PR = 1.14; 95%CI 1.01-1.30) and opening times that match the user's needs (PR = 1.40; 95%CI 1.25-1.57) they were associated with the outcome. The individual factors and factors related to the organization of the healthcare service are associated with oral healthcare utilization during prenatal care.
