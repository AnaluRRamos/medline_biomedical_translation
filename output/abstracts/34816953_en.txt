The study aimed to analyze factors associated with inflammatory biomarkers in adolescents. This was a cross-sectional study in 391 adolescents 17-18 years of age in public schools in São Luís, Maranhão State, Brazil. Three-stage random cluster sampling was performed in schools, classes, and students. Food consumption was studied with a food frequency questionnaire, and dietary patterns were extracted by principal components factor analysis. Assessment of factors associated with inflammatory biomarkers used structural equation modeling. Latent variables were constructed: socioeconomic status, which included maternal schooling, family income, and economic class; and inflammation, consisting of interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and interleukin-8. A theoretical model was developed to assess factors associated with inflammatory biomarkers, indicating direct and indirect effects between the latent and observed variables. Three dietary patterns were identified (Western, basic Brazilian, and healthy), with 31% explained variance and the Western pattern with the largest share. No associations were found between the patterns and the latent variable inflammation (standardized coefficients = 0.281; p = 0.002). Extraction of the three patterns evidenced higher consumption of foods high in carbohydrates and fats, which are nutrients associated directly with the increase in chronic noncommunicable diseases. Excess weight was associated with higher levels of inflammatory biomarkers.
