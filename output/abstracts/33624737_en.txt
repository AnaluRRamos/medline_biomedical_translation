In Brazil, since 2001, pesticides in food products have been monitored by the Program for Analysis of Pesticide Residues in Food Products (PARA, in Portuguese). The study aimed to analyze the challenges and strides in the control of pesticide residues in food products in Brazil based on the program's results from 2001 to 2015. A descriptive-analytical document review was conducted that used data from reports by the PARA, available at the website of the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency. The program's main challenges feature the wide variation in the number of samples and active ingredients analyzed, as well as the reports' format. There is a need for more in-depth discussions of the criteria used for classification and authorization of active ingredients in Brazil, as well as the information's transparency to society. A total of 25 types of foods were analyzed, with more than 30,000 samples, since the PARA has been in force, but the maximum number of active ingredients analyzed was 228. The presence of active ingredients unauthorized for crops and unauthorized in the country was the principal cause of irregularities diagnosed in the foods. Although the program still faces various challenges, it helps spawn debate on the issue in society. Given the current government context of greater flexibility in the authorization of active ingredients in Brazil, it is necessary to strengthen the PARA.
