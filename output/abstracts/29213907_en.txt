The Conversation Analysis Profile for People with Aphasia (CAPPA) provides specific information about strengths and weaknesses of the communication between people with aphasia and their family caregiver within a conversational context. The aim of this paper was to present the results of the first stages of cross-cultural adaptation of the CAPPA for the European Portuguese language. This methodology study describes the translation and back-translation processes, following the recommended steps to that end. In addition, following the consent of one of the original authors, the process of content validation of the CAPPA commenced. The instrument was submitted for assessment before a panel of experts in the area, who constituted the population of this study. After the translation and back-translation processes, a panel of experts was convened to adapt the Delphi technique. Some questions were excluded on the basis of ambiguity, relevance and potential repetition. Suggestions made by the expert panel were included in a revised version of the tool. 159 items obtained a 100% consensus in relevance, and 157 items were considered suitable by the expert panel, validating the content of the instrument. The final version will now be applied to the target population in order to carry out the psychometric validation.
