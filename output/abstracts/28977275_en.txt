: This study aimed to understand and analyze how processes of continuing education are experienced by professionals in the Centers for the Support of Family Health (NASF) and family health teams. The aim was also to understand how matrix support as a strategy for continuing education was incorporated into the work of these professionals. This was a multiple case study with a qualitative approach in six municipalities in southeast Bahia State, Brazil, which had type-I NASF. Semi-structured interviews were held with 43 NASF professionals and 40 with physicians and nurses from the supported teams. The interviews were categorized and analyzed using thematic content analysis. The results showed that the activities in continuing education are insufficient and inadequate, with a supply of sporadic training developed with a traditional teaching methodology. Continuing education had not been institutionally consolidated in the six municipalities. Training in matrix support and the work process in the NASF proved weak for both groups, which interfered in the support function and management of care. The study revealed the limited action of NASF as promotors of continuing education for the supported teams.
