To describe the implantation of the Surveillance System for Noncommunicable Diseases (NCDs) in the Unified Health System (Sistema Único de Saúde) and the challenges in maintaining it. A literature review was carried out the information contained in federal government directives between 2003 and 2015 was consulted. A comprehensive risk and protection factor surveillance system was implemented. It is capable of producing information and providing evidence to monitor changes in the health behavior of the population. Among the advances cited are the organization of epidemiological surveys, such as the Surveillance System for Risk Factors and Protection for NCD (Sistema de Vigilância de Fatores de Risco e Proteção para DCNT - Vigitel), the National School Health Survey (Pesquisa Nacional de Saúde do Escolar - PeNSE), and the National Health Survey (Pesquisa Nacional de Saude) from 2013, which enabled the most extensive health diagnosis of the Brazilian population. In 2011, the NCD National Plan 2011-2022 established targets for reducing risk factors and NCD mortality. The information gathered from the NCD surveillance system can support the implementation of sectoral and intersectorial strategies, which will result in the implementation of the Brazilian Strategic Action Plan for the prevention and control of NCDs, as well as the monitoring and evaluation of their results periodically. Finally, it can be a very important tool to help Brazil achieve the goals proposed by the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Global Plan to Tackling NCDs.
