Fibrous dysplasia is a bone disease characterized by abnormal differentiation of fibrous tissue in the bones; it is often asymptomatic. It may affect one bone (monostotic) or several bones (polyostotic). The monostotic form primarily affects the ribs, but hardly ever affects the hand. It is important to make the differential diagnosis with malignant bone tumors. This article describes the treatment and outcome of a rare case of a patient admitted with a history of tumor growth in the right hand, diagnosed as fibrous dysplasia of the right second metacarpal. Male patient, 14 years of age, admitted to the Sarah Hospital with lesion on the dorsum of the right hand without pain complaints, previous history of trauma, nor local signs of inflammation. Physical examination revealed swelling on the dorsum of the second metacarpal, painless, with unaltered mobility and sensitivity. Radiography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging indicated the involvement of the entire length of the second metacarpal: only the distal epiphysis was preserved, with areas of bone lysis. After biopsy confirmation, the patient underwent surgery, using a long cortical graft for reconstructing the metacarpal. During the follow-up period of five years there were no signs of recurrence, and proper digital growth and functionality of the operated hand were observed.
