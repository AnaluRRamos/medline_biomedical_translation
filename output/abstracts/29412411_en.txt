This study aimed to evaluate the structure and process of institutional foster care services for the protection of children and adolescents who are victims of neglect and/or violence in Recife. A semi-structured questionnaire was applied to those responsible for the services. Variables frequency were calculated and the following implementation level classification system adopted: critical, when compliance was less than 40% of the recommended standards; inadequate, 40-59%; acceptable, 60%-89%; adequate and excellent, 90-100%. The qualitative analysis consisted in interviews with one manager from the Judiciary and three managers from the Executive. Of the five philanthropic institutions investigated, two had an excellent standard structure; two were acceptable and one inadequate. Among public institutions, one was considered inadequate and the others acceptable. Regarding the process, one institution was found to be excellent and the others acceptable. The content analysis identified that the greatest challenges to introduction of the measures envisaged in the Child and Adolescent Statute are drug use, family geographical remoteness, lack of integration with other institutions and staff turnover.
