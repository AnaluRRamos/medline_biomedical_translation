We report an unprecedented case of ectopic thymoma in a young adult. A 33-year-old male presented with a 10-day history of non-productive cough and fever. Investigation revealed mediastinal widening without pulmonary involvement. Computed tomography showed a large mass-14.8 × 10.8 × 8.4 cm-in the mid-posterior mediastinum, and a biopsy obtained by video-assisted thoracoscopy indicated that the mass was a tumor. Immunohistochemistry showed combined thymoma type AB1. Because of the considerable proportions of the tumor and its close proximity to major structures, the patient was treated with chemotherapy.
