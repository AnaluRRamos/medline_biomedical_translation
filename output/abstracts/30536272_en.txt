Tamoxifen (TMX) is the main drug used both in pre and postmenopausal women as adjuvant treatment for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. An important barrier to the use of TMX is the development of drug resistance caused by molecular processes related to genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, such as the actions of cytochrome P450 2D6 (<i>CYP2D6</i>) polymorphisms and of its metabolites. The present study aimed to review recent findings related to the impact of <i>CYP2D6</i> polymorphisms and how they can affect the results of TMX in breast cancer treatment. The keywords <i>CYP2D6</i>, <i>tamoxifen</i>, and <i>breast cancer</i> were searched in the PubMed, Scopus, The Cochrane Library, Scielo, and Bireme databases. Studies related to other types of neoplasms or based on other isoenzymes from cytochrome P450, but not on CYP2D6, were excluded. The impact of <i>CYP2D6</i> polymorphisms in the TMX resistance mechanism remains unclear. The <i>CYP2D6</i> gene seems to contribute to decreasing the efficacy of TMX, while the main mechanism responsible for therapy failure, morbidity, and mortality is the progression of the disease.
