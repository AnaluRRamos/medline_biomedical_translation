To analyze the demographic, behavioral and occupational factors associated with obesity among urban collective transportation workers of the Metropolitan Region of Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais State, Brazil. This is a cross-sectional study conducted with 1,448 drivers and collectors in the Metropolitan Region of Belo Horizonte. Anthropometric, demographic, behavioral data, as well as participants' link to the company and bus conditions were gathered in 2012 through a questionnaire applied by an interviewer. To calculate obesity, the body mass index cut off point was â‰¥ 30 kg/m2. Prevalence ratios (PR) and respective 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were adjusted by Poisson's multivariate regression. The prevalence of obesity among urban collective transportation workers was 16.1%. Female sex (PR = 1.84; 95%CI 1.37 - 2.49), aging 30 to 39 years old (PR = 1.66; 95%CI 1.17 - 2.37) and 40 to 49 years old (PR = 1.59; 95%CI 1.04 - 2.42), being in the same job role from 5.01 to 10 years (PR = 1.52; 95%CI 1.04 - 2,42) and from 20.01 to 47 years (PR = 1.90; 95%CI 1.21 - 3.00), and physical inactivity (PR = 1.32; 95%CI 1.01 - 1.73) remained independently associated with obesity after multivariate adjustment data. These findings highlight the need to consider actions that encourage employees to participate in healthy activities when discussing health promotion for public transport workers, as well as actions to improve the organization and management of work, so it becomes a health and well-being feature for this population.
