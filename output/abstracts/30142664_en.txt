To identify maternal factors associated with the presence of low birth weight in term neonates.  Matched hospital-based case-controlled study performed in a high complexity institution located in the city of Neiva, Colombia. The study included women with term gestation and singleton live fetuses. Patients with prior diseases, coming from other regions, with pregnancy resulting from assisted reproduction, or with a diagnosis of fetal abnormality or aneuploidy were excluded. Low birth weight was the dependent variable, and the independent variables that were analyzed were maternal sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Adjusted and non-adjusted odds ratios (aOR and OR) together with the 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were reported.  The study included 270 participants (90 cases and 180 controls). Controlling for maternal age, educational level, socioeconomic and civil status, social security and the presence of maternal disease during gestation, it was found that weight gain (aOR 0.77, 95% CI 0.70-0.85) and the absence of prenatal care (aOR 8.20, 95% CI 3.22-20.87) were among the factors associated with low birth weight.  The absence of weight gain and of prenatal care are factors associated with the presence of low birth weight in term neonates and should be considered in clinical practice.
