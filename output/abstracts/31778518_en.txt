The scope of this study was to analyze the narratives of health professionals about their experiences on courses aimed at the development of knowledge and practices in health education. Two analytical categories formed the basis of this study: experience and temporality. In the analysis, narratives constructed based upon the educational experiences of health professionals in postgraduate courses were used, in order to give substance to their reflections in relation to given learning trajectories. These courses are based on articulated activities that simulate practices and performances in realistic scenarios. In analytical terms, the focus is on the structural components of the narrative (contexts, scenarios, storylines and actors), as well as the articulation between these components and the theoretical principles of the study. Among the results obtained, the highlight is on the active methodologies that are the central players in the storylines, thereby providing an opportunity to consider health training in a way that is different from traditional approaches. Among other aspects, the conclusion reached is that these narratives provide new possibilities such that, in addition to the cognitive domain and theoretical understanding, this practice may be valued and exploited as a historical and social construction based on both words and actions.
