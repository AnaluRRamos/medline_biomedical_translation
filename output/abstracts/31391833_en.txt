Compare World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for contraception in a human rights framework with the existing regulatory frameworks of Bolivia, Colombia, and Uruguay and evaluate which aspects of those regulations need to be developed. A systematic analysis was based on the WHO analytical framework 'Ensuring human rights in the provision of contraceptive information and services: Guidance and recommendations' to determine whether the legislation of Bolivia, Colombia, and Uruguay contain general references to the population, specific references to adolescents, or do not refer to the topic. To this end, 36 documents related to contraception were analyzed: 9 from Bolivia, 15 from Colombia, and 12 from Uruguay. It was confirmed that each country's legislation complies with several WHO recommendations. The three countries have strengths in nondiscrimination and in opportunity for informed decision-making, and have weaknesses in accessibility, quality, and accountability. Acceptability is a strength in Colombia and Bolivia, and confidentiality is a strength in Bolivia and Uruguay. Colombia has weaknesses in availability, confidentiality, and participation. Comparison of national legislation with WHO guidance helps to see the strengths and weaknesses of national regulatory frameworks and to see opportunities to improve regulations.
