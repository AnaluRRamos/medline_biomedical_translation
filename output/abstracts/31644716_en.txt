To verify the elastic therapeutic tape effects on the trapezius muscle in healthy adults, using data from surface electromyography and a self-reported questionnaire. A total of 51 across sex healthy adults were enrolled in this study, whose age range was 20 to 35 years.. The individuals were divided into three groups: G1, who wore the elastic therapeutic tape applied with tension; G2, who wore the elastic therapeutic tape applied with no tension; and G3, control group, who did not wear the elastic therapeutic tape. The elastic therapeutic tape was bilaterally applied on the trapezius muscle. For measuring results, surface electromyography signals were collected before, while and after the elastic therapeutic tape was worn, and a qualitative questionnaire was applied. There were no significant differences in either pre- or post-electromyography findings within each group, or when groups were compared. When comparing G1 and G2 moments before and while the elastic therapeutic tape was worn, a statistically significant difference was noted during the maximum voluntary contraction variable on the individuals' left side. When answering the questionnaire, most individuals mentioned a relaxing feeling while wearing the elastic therapeutic tape. The individuals wearing the elastic therapeutic tape in this sample did not present any significant differences during the surface electromyography assessment. As for the questionnaire, most of the individuals investigated reported a relaxing feeling after wearing the elastic therapeutic tape.
