To evaluate supraspinatus tendon integrity with ultrasound (US) in patients submitted to proximal humeral fracture (PHF) fixation with a locking intramedullary nail. Thirty-one patients with PHF treated with curvilinear locking intramedullary nail, aged between 50 and 85 years, were assessed by US at six months postoperatively and clinically at six and 12 months postoperatively. The primary aim was supraspinatus tendon integrity, evaluated by US at six months postoperatively. Secondary aims included the Constant-Murley, DASH score, and visual analog pain scores, as well as complications and reoperation rates. Full-thickness rotator cuff ruptures were observed in four patients (13%), supraspinatus ruptures in three cases (10%), and subscapularis ruptures in one case (3%). Partial ruptures were diagnosed in 10 cases (32%). The results using the Constant-Murley score at 12 months were 71.3 ± 15.2 points for the entire series, with 73.2 ± 16.1 points for patients without rotator cuff ruptures and 68.7 ± 14.1 points for those with partial or complete ruptures, without a statistically significant difference (<i>p</i> = 0.336). Complications, exclusively for rotator cuff ruptures, were observed in nine patients (29%). A high rate of rotator cuff ruptures was demonstrated, with partial ruptures in 32% of cases and full-thickness ruptures in 13%. However, clinical results are satisfactory, and are not influenced by the presence of rotator cuff ruptures.
