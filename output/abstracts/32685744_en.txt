Musculoskeletal complaints of the arm, neck and/or shoulder not attributed to acute trauma or any systemic disorder (CANS) are characterized by symptoms such as pain, numbness and paresthesia which may reach severe and disabling levels and thus significantly interfere with the performance of work and daily living activities. Computer use at work considerably increased in recent years, being attended with a substantial elevation of the prevalence of CANS among individuals who use computers at work. To investigate biomechanical and psychosocial risk factors, scapular static imbalance and functional impact on work and daily living activities of upper limb complaints among workers who use computers. We analyzed ergonomic and psychosocial risk factors by means of MUEQ-Br, scapular static malposition with the SICK-scapula protocol, and functional impairment in work and daily living activities with DASH. The sample comprised 109 employees of a private institution who use computers at work. The average scores on body posture and control over tasks were significantly higher among the symptomatic participants. Scapular malposition did not differ between the symptomatic and asymptomatic participants, but functional impairment did. Awkward posture at work and poor control over tasks seem to contribute to the occurrence of CANS among office workers who use computers. Scapular malposition is not systematically present among individuals with CANS, but the opposite is true. Individuals with CANS exhibited functional impairments.
