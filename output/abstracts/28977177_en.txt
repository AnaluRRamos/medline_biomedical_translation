to identify spatial and space-time clusters of risk for tuberculosis and to characterize them according to social vulnerability. ecological study which considered cases of tuberculosis in the municipality of São Carlos-SP, in the period from 2008 to 2013; spatial scan statistic was applied; the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI:) were calculated; the Social Vulnerability Index of São Paulo State was used to characterize the clusters. three clusters were identified: two of high risk (RR=7.44; 95%CI: 4.73;11.65 / RR=6.94; 95%CI: 3.82;12.57) and one of low risk (RR=0.3; 95%CI: 0.35;0.96); all the clusters presented very low and medium vulnerability; in the space-time analysis, two clusters presented high risk (RR=12.6; 95%CI: 7.07;19.58 / RR=11.78; 95%CI: 6.00;21.47), with the same tracts of spatial analysis and classification of social vulnerability. the results may address to specific actions for tuberculosis control considering the early detection of the cases in the areas with higher transmission of the disease.
