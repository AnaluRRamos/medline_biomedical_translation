This paper aims to analyze the relationship between the cost of health care and the aging of the population assisted by a self-managed plan, reflecting on the ways to address the challenge arising from this conjunction of population demographic changes. This is a descriptive study of the 1997-2016 period based on secondary data from the management operator of the health plan under study and from another administrative database of a self-managing provider with broad nationwide coverage. Older adults (over 60 years) increased 55% during the study period. On the other hand, the so-called 'very old' (over 80 years) grew 332.8%. The population above 60 years corresponds to 25.7% of the total, and accounts for 68.8% of expenses. Most of the population covered (84,6%) is located in the State of Rio de Janeiro, which has the highest per capita health care cost in Brazil. We found a relationship between aging of the beneficiary population and increased expenditure. It is imperative to invest in health promotion and disease prevention initiatives as a way of improving the quality of life and financial sustainability of the plan, and define a subsystem that delimits and regulates access to the network and is accepted by the beneficiaries.
