To evaluate the association between bone mineral density (BMD) and body composition in healthy older adults at different skeletal sites. We analyzed 87 medical records and BMD along with the body composition of men ranging from 60 to 87 years of age (mean: 68.5, standard deviation: 6.5). Inclusion criteria were normal BMD values (T-score greater than or equal to -1.0) and body mass index within normal or overweight range (18.5 to 29.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Body composition was evaluated using bone densitometry with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) in a LUNAR-DPX apparatus. Greater lean mass, fat mass, and soft tissue was associated with better BMD values in older adults, and higher age was associated with poorer BMD. Body composition (lean and fat masses and soft tissue) in older men is positively associated with BMD at all body sites (arms, legs, and trunk). Level of Evidence II; Prognostic studies - Investigating the effect of a patient characteristic on the outcome of disease.
