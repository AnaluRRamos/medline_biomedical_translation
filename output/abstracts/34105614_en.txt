To investigate the influence of photobiomodulation associated with orofacial myofunctional therapy (OMT) in patients with temporomandibular muscle disorders (TMD). Randomized, blinded trial clinical study with a sample of eleven women with muscle TMD divided into two groups. The experimental group (EG) consisted of five women submitted to orofacial myofunctional therapy associated with photobiomodulation, and the control group (CG) consisted of six women submitted to orofacial myofunctional therapy associated with inactive photobiomodulation (placebo). The intervention was performed in the following twelve sessions: one evaluation, ten speech therapy sessions associated with photobiomodulation, and one reevaluation. For outcomes, investigation on pain perception using the visual analogue scale (VAS), investigation of palpation sensitivity with the research diagnostic criteria for temporomandibular disorders (RDC/TMD), and quality of life (QOL) verification through oral health impact profile - short form (OHIP-14) were considered. The EG increased measurements of mandibular movements of opening and protrusion and improved in the evaluation of QOL. Orofacial myofunctional therapy, when associated with photobiomodulation, contributed to increase the range of mandibular movements, with important improvements in the perception of quality of life and with significant improvement in the painful conditions of volunteers with TMD.
