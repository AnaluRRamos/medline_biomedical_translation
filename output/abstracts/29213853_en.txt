Staff training has been cited as an effective intervention to reduce behavioral and psychiatric symptoms of dementia (BPSD) in nursing home residents. However, the reproducibility of interventions can be a barrier to their dissemination. A systematic review of controlled clinical trials on the effectiveness of staff training for reducing BPSD, published between 1990 and 2013 on the EMBASE, PUBMED, LILACS, PSYCHINFO and CINAHL databases, was carried out to evaluate the reproducibility of these interventions by 3 independent raters. The presence of sufficient description of the intervention in each trial to allow its reproduction elsewhere was evaluated. Descriptive analyses were carried out. Despite reference to a detailed procedures manual in the majority of trials, these manuals were not easily accessible, limiting the replication of studies. The professional expertise requirement for training implementation was not clearly described, although most studies involved trainers with moderate to extensive expertise, further limiting training reproducibility.
