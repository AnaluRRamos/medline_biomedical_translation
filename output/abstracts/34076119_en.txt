The elderly population is vulnerable to the risks of the use of medications, especially those considered potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs), in which the risks outweigh the benefits. The study sought to evaluate the PIMs prescribed in Primary Health Care (PHC) and associated factors. A cross-sectional, analytical study was carried out from March to December 2019 in PHC in Campina Grande, Para√≠ba, through interviews with 458 elderly individuals. The independent variables included socioeconomic characteristics, health status and the use of medications, and the outcome was classified as PIM by the Brazilian Consensus on Potentially Inappropriate Medications. There was a prescription of at least one PIM for 44.8% of the elderly and the majority affecting the Central Nervous System (54.4%). In the adjusted model, depression (PR=2.01; 95%CI 1.59-2.55), using other medications in addition to those prescribed (PR=1.36; 95%CI 1.08-1.72) and polypharmacy (PR=1.80; 95%CI 1.40-2.33) remained an associated factor, and self-reporting systemic arterial hypertension became a protective factor (PR=0.65; 95%CI 0.49-0.87). This reveals the need for actions to monitor closely the use of PIMs by the elderly to ensure access in conjunction with safety.
