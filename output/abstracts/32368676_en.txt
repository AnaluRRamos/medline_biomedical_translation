Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are major causes of morbidity among workers. They comprise several signs and symptoms, as e.g. pain, paresthesia, fatigue and limited range of motion, which can be related to work tasks. Workplace-related factors include physical, psychological, social and biomechanical hazards. The main kinetic factors associated with MSDs include repetitive movements, exerting excessive force, awkward postures, compression and mechanical vibration. Accurate knowledge of epidemiological aspects, evaluation of ergonomic hazards and musculoskeletal symptoms, and workplace exercise may help reduce the occurrence of MSDs. The aim of the present review is to analyze the applicability of preventive strategies against MSDs among workers. We performed a narrative review based on a survey of databases PubMed and BIREME and included studies published in English, Spanish or Portuguese. We found that workplace exercise is beneficial for both employers and workers. Risk analysis of MSDs is essential for early identification of occupational hazards and to prevent health consequences and costs associated with absenteeism.
