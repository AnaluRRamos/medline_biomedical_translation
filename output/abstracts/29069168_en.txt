In 2017, Epidemiology and Health Services: journal of the Brazilian National Health System (RESS) celebrates 25 years. RESS was created in 1992 as SUS Epidemiological Report (IESUS) and, in 2003, adopted its current name and format. This study's objectives are to describe the subjects covered and the geographical spread of authors' institutions of the articles published in IESUS and RESS; and to map RESS' editorial policies and strategies in the following areas of focus: education, information, communication, co-responsibility and anticipation. The comparison between IESUS (1992-2002) and RESS (2003-2016) periods revealed an increase in the number of documents published, as well as an increase in the topics covered, the geographical spread of the authors and the scope of publication. The mapping of editorial policies and strategies has evidenced a large number of initiatives aligned with the principles of publication ethics, which may have contributed to the development of the journal.
