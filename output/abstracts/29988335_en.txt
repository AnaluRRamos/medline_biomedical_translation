The surrounding circumstances and environments of Malaysian older adults could make conducting interventions (mainly in terms of clinical or randomized controlled trials) a challenge. Working with older adults and facing cultural issues could be challenging. This paper illustrates a significant perspective of some of the challenges faced while conducting a randomized controlled trial exploring the impact of a multi-component intervention that included strategy- and process-based prospective memory (PM) training among Malaysian older adults. The current study was a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and therefore the challenges were presented in accordance with the CONSORT statement style. A discussion on how these issues were addressed is provided. Some suggestions were presented to help researchers plan and create interventions for similar studies and to support a practical method of addressing all related challenges.
