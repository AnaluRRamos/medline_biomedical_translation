Studies emphasize the training of cognitive functions to decrease losses in the population. Memory training associated with neurotracker was performed by an 80-year-old man with memory complaints. A battery for measuring memory, quality of life and stress was initially applied and showed low scores. The patient underwent a program for stimulating memory and attention comprising 32 sessions (2 weekly sessions of 90 minutes each). The post-test follow-up showed improvements in the process of storage and retrieval of episodic and working memory, greater use of strategies, faster information processing speed, as well as reduction in complaints and positive impact on quality of life. The results suggest that the use of Neurotracker for training cognitive processes is valid for cognitive rehabilitation programs to promote improvements in quality of life in the elderly.
