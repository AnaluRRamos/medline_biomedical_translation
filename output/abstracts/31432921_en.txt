to identify the frequency of fatigue and domains affected in patients with head and neck cancer undergoing radiation therapy, at the beginning, middle and end of treatment. longitudinal and prospective study of quasi-experimental design, involving 60 patients with head and neck cancer. It should be highlighted that this article will address only the data of the Control Group. The dependent variables were collected through interview, using the revised Piper Fatigue Scale, which is a multidimensional instrument that assesses global, behavioral, affective and sensory/psychological domains. Data analysis was based on absolute and relative frequencies. there was a predominance of males, age group between 41-60 years, low level of education and in regular use of alcohol and cigarettes. All domains in the fatigue scale had their scores increased, presenting median values of greater magnitude in Time 2 and Time 3, when compared to the Time 1 values, indicating an increase in fatigue levels during radiation therapy. fatigue increased in the course of the radiation therapy, having all domains affected. Therefore, its evaluation throughout the treatment is important, as fatigue is a common and debilitating symptom on cancer patients.
