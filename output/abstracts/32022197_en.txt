The scope of this study was to identify and analyze the scientific production on behavior and knowledge about the sexuality of elderly people living with HIV. An integrative review of scientific articles indexed in the Lilacs, IBECS, Medline, BDENF, PubMed and Scopus (Elsevier) databases was conducted, considering publications from January 2007 to December 2016, using the following key words: knowledge, behavior, sexuality, Elderly, HIV/AIDS. Of the 1493 articles located, 11 were included because they met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed through two instruments: Critical Appraisal Skill Program (CASP) and Agency for Healthcare and Research and Quality (AHRQ). The data suggest that HIV-positive elderly people are sexually active and are involved in risk behaviors of virus transmission. It transpires that there is a limited scientific production regarding the behavior and knowledge about sexuality among elderly people living with HIV. The conclusion drawn is that the study may contribute to the improvement of public health policies that promote the approach on sexuality among elderly people, as well as the emergence of new questions regarding this issue.
