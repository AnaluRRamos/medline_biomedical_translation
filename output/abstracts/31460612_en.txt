The study's objective was to perform budget impact assessment for the incorporation of second-line intravitreal antiangiogenic therapy for diabatic macular edema in the scope of the Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS) in Minas Gerais state, Brazil, discussing the incorporation's state budget feasibility. The budget impact assessment was performed as a deterministic method according to Ministry of Health guidelines. The study included patients with probable first-line treatment failure in a five-year timeline for all the technologies assessed. The analysis included the drugs bevacizumab (off-label use), ranibizumab, and aflibercept. The populations were calculated both by observed demand and epidemiological estimate. The following sensitivity analyses were performed: a scenario with slower technology diffusion, a scenario with the market entry of biosimilar versions of bevacizumab and ranibizumab, and a scenario disregarding inflation during the period. The incremental budget impacts according to observed and epidemiologically estimated demand, respectively, were BRL 69,493,906.95 to BRL 473,226,278.78 for bevacizumab; BRL 349,319,965.60 to BRL 2,378,732,103.09 for ranibizumab; and BRL 543,867,485.47 to BRL 3,703,524,490.16 for aflibercept. Bevacizumab proved to be the most financially feasible alternative in all the scenarios of estimates and sensitivity analyses. An increment of nearly 3% was estimated, compared to the 2016 budget (observed demand). The study showed that the incorporation is feasible in the SUS, Minas Gerais State, but subject to management priorities. Price discrepancies between products with similar efficacy is intriguing and provides fertile ground for future studies.
