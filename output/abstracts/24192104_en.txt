The ejaculatory ducts obstruction is an uncommon finding in the study of infertility male factor. We present two cases referred to our department for conjugal infertility, with proven male factor (low ejaculate volume and azoospermia). On physical examination there was no abnormality in both patients. Imaging studies demonstrated intra-prostatic cystic structure, causing ejaculatory ducts dilation. We performed transurethral resection of the ejaculatory ducts. Semen analysis 3 months postoperatively showed 1 case of normalization and 1 case of improvement in sperm count parameters. The couple 1 couple has 2 children, without medical assisted reproductive techniques. The couple 2 had one pregnancy after Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection, from the ejaculate. This diagnosis depends on a strong clinical suspicion and is of high importance, since this disease has effective surgical treatment. The authors aim to highlight the relevance of the assessment andrological when studying marital infertility.
