The checklist was validated by three nurses, two nursing technicians, a pharmacist, two nurse teachers and one medical teacher, all with extensive experience in drug administration and in clinical research. For the final version of the checklist, a consensus of 100% was considered. A guide was prepared consisting of six items to be checked by the care team before, during and after administration of Clinical Research drugs. The validation of the checklist provided guiding elements for the prevention of behaviors that could lead to the risk of adverse events and also allowed the care teams to seek safe strategies of care in drug administration.
