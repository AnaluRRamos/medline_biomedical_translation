To establish the relationship between the performance on word recognition tasks, using words with and without sense and degree, and the configuration of hearing loss, by using Speech Inteligibility Index (SII) values as indicators, in children with hearing loss. SII were established for 55 and 65 Decibel of Sound Pressure Level (dB SPL) input sounds of ten children presenting bilateral sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), adapted with bilateral hearing aids, and who have oral language as the main mode of communication. The children were submitted to a word and nonsense-word repetition task of two or three intensity degrees. Their productions were analyzed according to the Word Association for Syllable Perception (WASP) Protocol. In the data analysis, the values of SII were compared with the results obtained in each analysis criterion. Pertaining to the words, there was statistically significant difference between the two types of stimuli in 55 dBSPL. As for the performance of consonants and point of articulation, there was a statistically significant difference between stimuli types in 65 and 55 dB SPL, and between intensities 65 and 55 dB SPL in nonsense words. Overall, there was no regularity in the relationship between hearing ability and performance in speech perception tasks. The results suggest that performance in the nonsense words recognition tasks was more related to intelligibility index than to words with meaning, possibly because it limits semantic closure strategies by the subject.
