Embolization is a well-known and accepted form of treatment for bleeding caused by a multitude of renal procedures. We present a case of a 66-year-old woman who had a history of left nephrectomy for clear cell carcinoma seven years previously and now presented with a 6 cm tumor involving the solitary kidney. She underwent partial laparoscopic nephrectomy with removal of the tumor on the right kidney. In the immediate postoperative period she had important and persistent hematuria associated with tachycardia, hypotension, and lumbar pain. After showing signs of hemodynamic instability, she was taken to the catheter laboratory where selective angiography of the right kidney was performed. Superselective embolization with controlled release of fibrous microcoils was performed. The superselective renal embolization technique performed on an emergency basis to control hemorrhage after a urological procedure is effective and achieves lasting resolution of symptoms.
