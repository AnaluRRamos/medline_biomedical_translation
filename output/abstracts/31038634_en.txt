to evaluate the effect of a telephone intervention on the self-efficacy of puerperal women in the duration and exclusivity of breastfeeding. randomized controlled trial composed of 85 breastfeeding mothers at 2 months and 77 at 4 months. The sample was randomized into two groups, control and intervention. The intervention consisted of a telephone follow-up performed at seven, 15 and 30 days after delivery using the precepts of Motivational Interview and Self-Efficacy in Breastfeeding. self-efficacy in breastfeeding at 2 months was similar in both groups (p = 0.773). However, at 4 months, the intervention group presented higher self-efficacy than the control group (p = 0.011). There was a difference between groups in the duration of breastfeeding at 2 months (p = 0.035). At 4 months, the intervention group remained in breastfeeding when compared to the control group (p = 0.109). Both groups did not show differences in exclusive breastfeeding at two (p = 0.983) and four months (p = 0.573). the telephone educational intervention was effective in improving self-efficacy and duration of breastfeeding, but not exclusivity.
