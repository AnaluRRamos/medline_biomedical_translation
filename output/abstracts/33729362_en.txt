The scope of this study was to estimate the prevalence of excess weight and a sedentary lifestyle among Brazilian students between 13 and 17 years of age and investigate the magnitude of the socioeconomic inequalities related to these outcomes. A cross-sectional study was carried out based on data from the National School Health Survey (PeNSE) conducted in 2015. Inequalities were evaluated using the Absolute and Relative Index of Inequality. The prevalence of excess weight in Brazil was 24.2%, ranging from 20.7% in the Northeast Region to 27.8% in the Southern Region. The prevalence of a sedentary lifestyle in Brazil was 67.8%, ranging from 61.8 % in the North Region to 70.3% in the Southeast Region. The direct and positive association between better socioeconomic conditions and the prevalence of excess weight and a sedentary lifestyle indicate health inequities in Brazil. The results of this study point to the need to restructure and reinforce public policies directed at adolescents, which should have as guidelines the promotion of a healthy lifestyle and the reduction of health inequities.
