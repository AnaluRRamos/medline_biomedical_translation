To understand the life experience of adolescents who use illicit drugs. A phenomenological qualitative study conducted in a Youth Integration Center of Sinaloa Mexico from October 2016 to July 2017. The phenomenological interview was conducted with 11 adolescent informants and was based on a leading question. Heideggerian hermeneutics were used as a reference for the analysis of the narratives that identified the phenomenon described. Three categories expressed the phenomenon: family roughness, which revealed a violent, oppressive world lacking in affection and moral values; experimenting in the world of drug use, which revealed its existence and experimentation with several drugs and the novelty in that world; and the hope of 'being there', which portrays an individual with possibilities to coexist with themselves, society, family, loved ones and their spirituality. The understanding of the life experience reflects the adolescent drug user's need for sensitive and comprehensive human care provided by a multidisciplinary health team.
