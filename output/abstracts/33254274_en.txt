Pre-eclampsia (PE) is an obstetric disease with a multifactorial cause that affects âˆ¼ 5% of pregnant women. Vision can be affected with varying severity, and retinal detachment is a very rare complication. It tends to be bilateral, diagnosed postpartum, and more prevalent in women who are primiparous and/or undergo caesarean delivery. The condition typically resolves completely and rarely causes total visual loss in the affected women. Fluorescence angiographic findings support the hypothesis that retinal detachment in PE is secondary to choroidal ischemia from intense arteriolar vasospasm. The present article is related to a case of a 37-year-old pregnant woman who had PE associated with a progressive blurred vision, diagnosed by ophthalmology as serous macular detachment of the retina.
