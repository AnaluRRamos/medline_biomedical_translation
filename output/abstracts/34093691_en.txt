Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (RAAA) evolving aortocaval fistula (AF) can have catastrophic hemodynamic effects. Surgical repair is imperative, but the optimal technical approach is still under debate. Our objective is to present 3 cases treated with endovascular repair (EVAR) at a University Hospital. Case #1, a 71-year-old man presenting a 7.1cm RAAA with AF, repaired with a monoiliac stent graft and femoral-femoral bypass; Case #2, a 76-year-old man presenting a 9.9cm RAAA with AF, repaired with a bifurcated stent graft; Case #3, a 67-year-old man with previous history of EVAR, presenting a type 3 endoleak with late rupture related to AF, repaired with a tubular stent graft. All cases unfolded with delayed recovery and significant complication rates, although AF symptoms had resolved by hospital discharge. EVAR techniques for AF may require secondary interventions but are feasible, despite the lack of consensus, considering the rarity of this RAAA presentation.
