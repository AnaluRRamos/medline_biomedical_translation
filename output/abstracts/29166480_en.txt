This qualitative clinical study investigated the impact of moderate intellectual disability on family dynamics and quality of life. The data were collected using individual interviews with 15 mothers of children with intellectual disabilities, as a convenience sample, and examined with categorical thematic content analysis. The results were discussed using a comprehensive and interpretative approach. Analysis of the interviews showed that care for children with intellectual disabilities is centered on the mother, contributing to the change in family relations. Religious coping appeared as a common strategy for adjusting. Children with intellectual disabilities had less access to services and support than they needed in the areas of health, education, and leisure. Financial constraints and difficulties in community living had a negative impact on the quality of family life. Emotional and psychological support for all the family members, and practical and social support, including income distribution and access to adequate services, proved essential for the well-being of children with intellectual disabilities and their families.
