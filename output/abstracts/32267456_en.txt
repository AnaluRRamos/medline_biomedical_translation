This paper analyzed the Burnout Syndrome (BS) among the managers of the Family Health Strategy (ESF) in the city of Rio de Janeiro and its associations with factors that influence the presence/absence of BS among these professionals. This is a descriptive study that used data from a questionnaire consisting of two parts: 1) manager profile and factors that could influence the presence of Burnout; 2) Maslach Burnout Inventory. The return rate was 63.5% (143) of the 225 questionnaires sent. The ESF managers are generally nurses (68.6%), young (63.6% under 39 years) female (76.9%), who have acted as managers for less than 5 years (85.2%). A BS presence was identified in 11.2% of the managers. The factors of an organizational nature were those that obtained the highest number of variables with an association. These data point to the need to make changes in the organizational practices of services and changes in work processes. Further studies on these issues can contribute to this.
