The area of Policy, Planning and Health Management (PPG) express the intersection between research, intervention and political action. The article analyzes the dynamics of knowledge production about PPG in the Journal Ciência & Saúde Coletiva (C&SC) from 1996 to 2019. The study articulates a bibliometric and qualitative approach to explore the profile of articles in three dimensions: thematic, methodological and authorship/institutional partnerships. 1680 PPG manuscripts were identified, corresponding to 28.3% of the total publications. Thematic analysis showed a strong influence of the context and the implementation of Unified Health System (SUS). Qualitative empirical studies predominated, followed by quantitative and quanti-qualitative studies. The combination of methodological procedures was frequent, with bibliographic review and interviews being the most cited. The average number of authors per article and national institutional partnerships increased. As most articles were published in Portuguese, the challenge of internationalization persists. The PPG area stands out in the Journal C&SC and in the production of scientific knowledge relevant to SUS.
