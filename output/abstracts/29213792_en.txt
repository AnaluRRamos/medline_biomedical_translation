To investigate the diagnostic value of subtests of the NEUROPSI battery for differentiating subcortical vascular dementia (SVaD) from Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thirteen patients with mild SVaD, 15 patients with mild probable AD, and 30 healthy controls, matched for age, education and dementia severity (in the case of patients), were submitted to the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and NEUROPSI battery. The performance of AD and SVaD groups on NEUROPSI subtests was compared. The statistical analyses were performed using Kruskal-Wallis, Chi-square and Mann-Whitney tests. The results were interpreted at the 5% significance level (p<0.05). Bonferroni's correction was applied to multiple comparisons (Î±=0.02). SVaD and AD patients showed no statistical difference in MMSE scores (SVaD=20.8 and AD=21.0; p=1.0) or in NEUROPSI total score (SVaD=65.0 and AD=64.3; p=0.56), suggesting a similar severity of dementia. The AD group performed worse on memory recall (<0.01) and SVaD group was worse in verbal fluency subtests (p=0.02). NEUROPSI's memory and language subtests can be an auxiliary tool for differentiating SVaD from AD.
