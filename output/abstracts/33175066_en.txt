The aim of the present study was to estimate the prevalence of psychotropic drug utilization among adults and seniors and determine associated factors, therapeutic classes and sources of acquisition. Data from the Brazilian National Survey on Access, Use and Promotion of the Rational Use of Medicines (2013-2014) were analyzed. The prevalence of use of at least one psychotropic drug in the overall sample (adults and seniors) was 8.7%. In the adjusted analyses, positive associations were found between the use of psychotropic drugs and the female sex, poorer self-rated health and chronic diseases (p < 0.05). The most frequently used therapeutic classes were antidepressants (55.3%) by the adults and anxiolytics (59.3%) by the seniors. Approximately 23.0% of psychotropic drugs were obtained exclusively from pharmacies of the public healthcare system and 77.0% were acquired from other sources. The findings reveal a low proportion of attaining psychotropic drugs through the Brazilian public healthcare system as well as the need for public policies that encourage the rational use of prescriptions and treatments to promote a better quality of life and ensure the population's right to health.
