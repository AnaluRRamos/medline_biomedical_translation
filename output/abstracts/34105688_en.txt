To evaluate group education strategies and telephone intervention regarding the variables empowerment, self-care practices, and glycemic control of people with diabetes. Clinical trial with eight randomized clusters, conducted between 2015 and 2016, with 208 users with type 2 diabetes mellitus allocated for group education, telephone intervention, or control group. Sociodemographic data, glycated hemoglobin, empowerment, and self-care practices were collected. The user mean age was of 63.5 years (SD = 8.9 years), with the participation of 124 women, which amounts to 59.6% of these users. The strategies led to a statistically significant reduction in the levels of glycated hemoglobin (p < 0.001). The telephone intervention was also observed to present statistically significant results regarding self-care practices (p < 0.001) and empowerment in diabetes (p < 0.001) when compared to group education. The telephone intervention presented statistically significant results for empowerment and practices of self-care when compared to group education.
