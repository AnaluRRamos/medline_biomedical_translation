This study investigates ultrasonography as an effective tool for localizing and measuring the depth and size of wooden foreign bodies to perform less invasive and easier surgery without the need for any additional radiological techniques. Fifteen patients were operated to remove foreign bodies in the extremities in 2016. The side of the affected extremity, the material, size, and location of the foreign body and time of admission after injury were noted, along with CRP, WBC, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate; length of incision, surgery duration, and complications were evaluated. The mean patient age was 39.66 (range: 6 to 68). Of the total, 8 of the foreign bodies were in the plantar surfaces of the feet, 3 were in the cruris, 2 were in the palm of the hand, and 2 were in the fingers. All patients underwent ultrasound evaluation before surgery. The surgeries lasted less than 10 min in 13 (87%) of the cases and from 10 to 20 min in 2 cases. No complications were observed in any of the patients. Delayed extraction of foreign bodies can lead to local infections. Ultrasonography can be a reliable option for diagnosing and localizing radiolucent foreign bodies such as wooden objects. <b><i>Level of Evidence IV; Case series.</i></b>
