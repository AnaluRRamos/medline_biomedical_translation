to demonstrate a surgical technique for treating neck fractures of the fifth metacarpal, by means of reduction through intra-focal manipulation and percutaneous fixation using Kirschner wires, with the aims of making it easier to achieve and maintain the reduction during the operation and enabling reduction of these fractures even if a fibrous callus has formed. a series of ten patients with neck fractures of the fifth metacarpal presenting palmar angles greater than 30Â° underwent the surgical technique described, as examples, and their results were evaluated through postoperative radiographs and clinical examinations. all the patients achieved reductions that were close to anatomical and evolved to consolidation of the fracture in the position obtained. the surgical technique described is effective, easy to carry out, minimally invasive and low-cost, thereby enabling adequate clinical and radiographic reduction, even in subacute fractures already presenting a fibrous callus.
