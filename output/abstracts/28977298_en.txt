To conduct a systematic review of the literature on the ability of anthropometric indicators to predict clustered cardiometabolic risk factors (CMRF) in children and adolescents. Studies published from June 1st, 2011 to May 31st, 2016 in the PubMed, SciELO and LILACS databases were analyzed. The research was based on keywords derived from the terms 'anthropometric indicators' AND 'cardiometabolic risk factors'. Observational studies on the ability of anthropometric indicators as predictors of clustered CMRF in children and adolescents in Portuguese, English and Spanish languages were included. Studies with a specific group of obese patients or with other diseases were not included. Of the 2,755 articles retrieved, 31 were selected for systematic review. Twenty-eight studies analyzed body mass index (BMI) as a predictor of clustered CMRF. Only 3 of the 25 cross-sectional studies found no association between anthropometric indicators and clustered CMRF. The results of six studies that compared the predictive ability of different anthropometric measures for clustered CMRF were divergent, and it was not possible to define a single indicator as the best predictor of clustered CMRF. Only six articles were cohort studies, and the findings suggested that changes in adiposity during childhood predict alterations in the clustered CMRF in adolescence. BMI, waist circumference and waist-to-height ratio were predictors of clustered CMRF in childhood and adolescence and exhibited a similar predictive ability for these outcomes. These findings suggest anthropometric indicators as an interesting screening tool of clustered CMRF at early ages.
