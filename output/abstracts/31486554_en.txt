Moxifloxacin is a fourth-generation fluoroquinolone (FQ) that is approved for use in people to treat a variety of infections. Some veterinary microbiology laboratories report moxifloxacin in culture and sensitivity profiles for Staphylococcus pseudintermedius and S. schleiferi albeit using Clinical & Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) breakpoints for S. aureus. Previous studies have shown that S. aureus breakpoints can mischaracterize S. pseudintermedius susceptibility to various drugs. Pradofloxacin is a third generation veterinary FQ with a similar mechanism of action and spectrum of activity to moxifloxacin; however, the dose format (25 mg/mL solution) available in the USA may limit its practical use in large dogs. To determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), mutant prevention concentration (MPC) and mutant selection window (MSW) of moxifloxacin and pradofloxacin for isolates of S. pseudintermedius and S. schleiferi. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was performed to establish that each bacterial isolate selected for testing represented an unique strain. The MIC, MPC and MSW for moxifloxacin and pradofloxacin were determined from 60 strains of S. pseudintermedius and seven strains of S. schleiferi. The MIC and MPC ranges of moxifloxacin and pradofloxacin for meticillin-susceptible S. pseudintermedius were similar. However, MIC and MPC ranges were much wider and resistance to both drugs was more common for meticillin-resistant strains of S. pseudintermedius and S. schleiferi. The narrow MSW of these drugs may reduce the risk of selecting for antibiotic-resistant subpopulations. Pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and safety studies are needed.
