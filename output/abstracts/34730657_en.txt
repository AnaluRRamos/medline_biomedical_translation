The scope of this article is to present and analyze the institutional governance profile of the 434 regional interagency committees operating in 25 states of the Brazilian Federation. The data were taken from the National Survey of Regional Interagency Committees (CIR), a census conducted in the years 2017 and 2018, and were collected through a questionnaire applied to the coordinators/directors/presidents of the CIR. The composition of the CIR profile was carried out using an analysis matrix specifically developed for this study, which combines 23 variables organized in five dimensions of institutional governance: institutional legitimacy, compliance and consistency of operation, quality of structure and operating conditions, federative equilibrium and quality of decision-making. The results show, on the one hand, an interagency institutional governance system consolidated throughout the national territory, with significant acceptance by the state and municipal spheres and clearly defined and publicized operating rules. On the other hand, it reveals a complex of levels characterized by marked limitations in financial and human resources and management infrastructure, in addition to action concentrated on emergency problems in the management of the network of health care and services.
