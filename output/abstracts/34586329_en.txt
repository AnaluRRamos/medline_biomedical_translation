to verify the effectiveness of a Speech Therapy intervention program to decrease the risk of falls in elderly people. Exploratory and intervention study where upon 148 volunteers from community, both genders, with an average of 68.6(± 6.5) years were submitted to the Dynamic Gait Index (DGI)- Brazilian brief and the Timed Up and Go (TUG). Volunteers with or without potential risk for falling were invited to participate in a 50-minutes long intervention program carried out for five consecutive weeks, based on Cawthorne and Cooksey exercises. Seventy-two volunteers 68.1(±6.5) years presented in at least three meeting, were reassessed. The results were analyzed by Wilcoxon, Chi-square, Spearman and Correlation Matrix tests, with p≤5.0%. Thirty-seven (25.0%) and 106 (71.6%) participants presented, respectively, risks for falls in the DGI-Brazilian brief and TUG. There was negative correlation between the DGI-Brazilian brief (p=0.034) and positive with the TUG (p=0.0071) with age and both instruments (p=0.00000016). Through the comparison the initial and final data a positive correlation was found for the DGI-Brazilian brief and for TUG in the Chi-square test and by Wilcoxon's. Better performance was observed in both tests after the intervention. The intervention was effective in decreasing the risk for falls and improving gait performance, and functional and dynamic balance.
