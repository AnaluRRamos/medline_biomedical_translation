A 45-year-old woman with known hypothyroidism and no other comorbidities was incidentally found to have multiple right renal artery aneurysms. The largest aneurysm measured 5 x 4.5 cm and arose from an inferior segmental branch while two smaller aneurysms arose from an upper segmental branch of the right renal artery. We performed an ex-vivo repair with reverse saphenous vein graft under cold preservation followed by orthotopic kidney auto-transplantation. Her postoperative course was unremarkable and at 1-year follow-up her right kidney is preserved. In this article, we report successful treatment of complex multiple right renal artery aneurysms and describe the surgical technique used for successful repair.
