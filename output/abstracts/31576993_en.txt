Adopting a different viewpoint from most of the work in the field of so-called rare diseases, this paper crosses the boundaries of the associations to reach people living with the diagnosis of a genetic condition, which is understood as being a rare disease, namely neurofibromatosis (NF). In this respect, the incipient Sociology of Diagnosis is utilized to identify both the impact and the consequences of the diagnosis in people's lives. As a result, the consensus is that it is necessary to transcend the charitable outlook on people who experience the diagnosis of a genetic condition, by perceiving the patient as a key informant in order to collect input to improve health services and our social relations.
