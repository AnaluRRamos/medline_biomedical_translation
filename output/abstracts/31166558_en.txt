To evaluate the effects of intravenous infusion of fluids and sodium on the first day of admission on infusion of enteral nutrition in the first 5 days in intensive care patients. A prospective cohort study was conducted with critical nonsurgical patients admitted for at least 5 days who were on mechanical ventilation and receiving enteral nutrition. The amount of intravenous fluids and sodium infused on the first day and the volume of enteral nutrition infused in the first 5 days were investigated. The volume of intravenous fluids > 35mL/kg or ≤ 35mL/kg of body weight and sodium (above or below the 25th percentile) infused on the first day was compared with infused enteral nutrition. A total of 86 patients were studied, with a mean (± standard deviation) of 65 ± 17 years, of which 54.7% were female. On the first day, 3,393.7 ± 1,417.0mL of fluid (48.2 ± 23.0mL/kg) and 12.2 ± 5.1g of sodium were administered. Fifty-eight (67.4%) patients received more than 35mL/kg of fluids. In 5 days, 67 ± 19.8% (2,993.8 ± 1,324.4mL) of the prescribed enteral nutrition was received. Patients who received > 35mL/kg of intravenous fluids also received less enteral nutrition in 5 days (2,781.4 ± 1,337.9 versus 3,433.6 ± 1,202.2mL; p = 0.03) versus those who received ≤ 35mL/kg. Patients with intravenous sodium infusion above the 25th percentile (≥ 8.73g) on the first day received less enteral nutrition volume in 5 days (2,827.2 ± 1,398.0 versus 3,509.3 ± 911.9mL; p = 0.02). The results of this study support the assumption that the administration of intravenous fluids > 35mL/kg and sodium ≥ 8.73g on the first day of hospitalization may contribute to the lower infusion of enteral nutrition in critically ill patients.
