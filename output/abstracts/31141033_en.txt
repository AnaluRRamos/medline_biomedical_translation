to evaluate the initial therapeutic experience of transplantation of vascularized lymph nodes in patients with lymphedema of the upper limbs secondary to the treatment of breast cancer, and to verify if the positioning of the transplant influences the surgical result. we conducted a prospective, comparative test of two therapeutic modalities, with 24 patients with lymphedema of the upper limb after breast cancer treatment, classified as grades 2 and 3, according to the International Lymphedema Society. The two types of procedures performed were: 1) total breast reconstruction with - deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap associated with lymph node flap, in patients with no previous breast reconstruction or loss of previous reconstruction (axillary positioning); 2) isolated inguinal lymph node flap performed in patients with completed breast reconstruction or without the desire to perform the breast reconstruction (wrist positioning). the reduction percentage of the affected limb volume was 20.1% (p=0.0370). The number of infectious episodes (cellulites) also decreased significantly, from 41% in the preoperative period to 12.5% in the postoperative one (p=0.004). There were no differences between the proximal and distal groups. the transplantation of lymph nodes positively affected the postoperative evolution of patients with lymphedema secondary to breast cancer. We observed no differences in relation to flap positioning.
