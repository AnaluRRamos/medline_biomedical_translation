The study aimed to explore the positive and negative experiences of mothers with exclusive breastfeeding. A descriptive, qualitative study enrolled 18 breastfeeding mothers of infants (≤ 1 year) recruited in the Municipal Immunization Service in Viçosa, Minas Gerais State, Brazil. Data were obtained from taped, transcribed interviews and submitted to content analysis to verify the thematic units related to positive and negative experiences, after which two texts were drafted, one for each situation. These texts were submitted to similarity analysis with the IRAMUTEQ software, generating two similarity trees. Interpretation of the similarity trees used concordance lines produced by the AntConc software. The principal negative breastfeeding experiences were the infant's constant demand for the breast, the impossibility of leaving the infant alone, painful breasts, and insecurity concerning the capacity to produce enough milk. The main positive experiences were the biological benefits of breastmilk, practicality, and lower cost. The study allowed grasping the positive and negative dimensions of exclusive breastfeeding and suggests the importance of professional assistance for the woman in the initial phase of breastfeeding, plus social network support to mitigate the woman's overburdened feeling.
