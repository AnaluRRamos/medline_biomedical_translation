To analyze association between food insecurity (FI) and sociodemographic factors among children. The study was carried out from May to November 2017 with mothers of children (18 - 35 months old) enrolled at public education facilities in São José dos Pinhais, Paraná, Brazil. FI was determined by the Brazilian Household Food Insecurity Measurement Scale. Multinomial logistic regression was used with a hierarchical model. 395 mothers/children participated. Overall FI prevalence was 34.7% (95%CI 28.5;41.5), with prevalence of 25.7% (95%CI 19.2;32.3) for mild FI (MFI) and 9.0% (95%CI 8.5;9.4) for moderate/severe FI (MSFI). Families in the lowest income tercile had higher likelihood of MFI (OR=3.06 - 95%CI 1.26;7.41) or MSFI (OR=6.35 - 95%CI 1.89;21.4) when compared to the highest tercile. Higher MFI prevalence was identified in male children (OR=2.34 - 95%CI 1.49;3.68). FI was associated with lower income and MFI with male children. Public policies to increase income must be included in FI reduction strategies.
