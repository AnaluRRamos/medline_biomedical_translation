To identify the characteristics of clients at an HIV clinic in Mexico City who fail to collect their HIV test results and to explore the reasons for non-collection. This was an exploratory, cross-sectional study that used 2016 program data from the HIV Testing and Counseling Center in Mexico City. Clients with a negative HIV-test result in 2016 were classified as collectors or non-collectors, and their sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics were compared by multivariate logistic regression. A telephone survey was conducted with individuals who failed to return for their results. In 2016, a total of 729 individuals obtained an HIV negative test result at the Center. Of these, 40% (<i>n</i> = 299) failed to collect results. In multivariate analysis, having a test requested by a physician, instead of by the individual, was the main variable associated with non-collection. The main reasons reported for not collecting were: unawareness of the collection process (23.6%, <i>n</i> = 21), already knowing the result (22.5%, <i>n</i> = 20), and scheduling difficulties (13.5%, <i>n</i> = 12). In all, 35% of clients were reached by telephone and 50% then returned to collect results. Modifications to the result-delivery system are needed to increase results collection. Improving communication with clients on the collection process and with physicians that request HIV testing could be viable strategies. Alternative ways of delivering results and using rapid HIV are other possible solutions, as long as risk reduction counseling and intervention are still effectively offered.
