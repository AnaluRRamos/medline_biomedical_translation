This study aims to evaluate the quality of the Portuguese Government's action in the health sector during Troika's intervention period (2011-2015), taking as criterion the concern with the application of Good Governance principles, in terms of degree and diversity. The intention is to understand the extent to which the public action promoted by the Ministry of Health has developed seeking to contribute to the strengthening of Good Governance practices. Fifty measures of the Ministry of Health, distributed by nine intervention areas, were analyzed, based on documental analysis, supported on the law and on other official documents. The principles of Good Governance that demonstrate a more transversal concern are clearly that of 'transparency' and of 'effectiveness/efficiency', present in eight of the nine intervention areas. The concern with 'orientation to consensus' is essentially present in the measures classified as Agreements, 'independence' in the Ethics area, the 'strengthening of the rule of Law' in the Control area and 'equity/inclusion' in the area of the Citizen in the Centre of the NHS.
