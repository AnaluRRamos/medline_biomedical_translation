The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of intention to breastfeed (IB) for an insufficient (under 6 months) or prolonged (24 months and longer) amount of time and to investigate its association with demographic and socioeconomic status, health behaviors, obstetric history, and previous breastfeeding experience among pregnant women. This is a cross-sectional study made with pregnant women under prenatal care in 17 units of the Family Health Strategy, in Colombo (PR). Crude and adjusted multinomial logistic regression analyses were used to identify associations between IB and exposure variables. Among pregnant women participating in the survey (n = 316), 99.1% reported IB. The average IB time was 13.5 months. The IB for insufficient and prolonged time was referred to by 9.8% and 22.0% of participants respectively. Those who presented the greatest changes of IB for insufficient time were women who: did not have a partner (OR 3.23, 95% CI 1.31; 7.94), who performed paid work (OR 5.56, 95% CI 2.10; 14.71), and smokers (OR 7.79, 95% CI 2.35; 25.81). Prolonged IB was more frequent among pregnant women with previous experience in prolonged breastfeeding (OR 3.05, 95% CI 1.02; 9.03). Factors associated to IA were found to support actions directed to vulnerable groups aiming the promotion of breastfeeding practices.
