To explore the actions and factors associated to patient advocacy by intensivist nurses using the Protective Nursing Advocacy Scale. A quantitative, descriptive-exploratory, cross-sectional study. The questionnaire was answered by nurses who worked in Intensive Care Units in the South and Southeast regions of Brazil. A factorial exploratory analysis of the data, T-tests and the chi-square test were used for association between factors. 451 nurses participated in the study. A greater number of nurses disagreed with the negative consequences that patient advocacy may have or bring to them. Greater dialogue among nursing staff would enhance teamwork results. Nurses with two or more job relationships need more physical and mental effort, which compromises their quality of life and work, leading to them being those who least practice patient advocacy. Nurses understand patient advocacy as an important part of their work, as well as factors which may influence their decision to defend their patients, but are still unaware of the benefits of advocacy.
