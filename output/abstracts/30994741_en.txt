In this article I provide a comparative interpretation of the itineraries used by trans men to deal with the issue of waiting, when confronted with challenges related to access to health services in Brazil and Argentina. The article was the result of anthropological research in the greater metropolitan areas of Goi√¢nia and Buenos Aires, aimed at contributing to discussions on access to health for trans men in these two contexts, seeking to identify ambivalences related to their treatment itineraries in search of biomedical care.
