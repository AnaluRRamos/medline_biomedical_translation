To investigate the geographical variability and factors associated with hospitalizations for ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSC) among older adults living in the state of Minas Gerais. This is an ecological study, based on data from the National Hospital Information System (SIH-SUS). Municipal rates of hospitalization for ACSC were compared to the state's average rate, and analysis of associated factors included sociodemographic characteristics, supply of health services and primary health care (PHC) activities. Data analysis was based on Bayesian spatial modeling. Most municipalities in Minas Gerais (479 or 56.2%) had a rate of hospitalization for ACSC below the state average. After multivariate analysis, income (β = -0,0008; 95%CI: -0.0014 - -0,0002) and the Family Health Strategy coverage (β = -0.4269; 95%CI: -0.7988 - -0.1116) were negatively associated with the risk of hospitalization for ACSC, while the availability of hospital beds (β = 0.0271; 95%CI 0.0211 - 0.0331) was positively associated. The characteristics of PHC did not show any association with the rate of hospitalization for ACSC. the rates of hospitalization for ACSC in the elderly population were influenced by the PHC coverage, but also by external factors such as income and structure and provision of health services, indicating that the meeting of population health demands passes through actions that go beyond the health sector, including investment in the reduction of poverty and inequality and expansion of access to PHC.
