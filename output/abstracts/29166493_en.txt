To report a case of severe dystrophic calcification in maxillary sinus of a child with liver transplantation and dental organs pigmented by hyperbilirubinemia. female patient, 12 years old, with liver transplantation performed at the age of 7 due to extrahepatic biliary atresia (EHBA). The patient was receiving the immunosuppressant tacrolimus (2 mg daily). Intraoral clinical exam showed tooth green pigmentation by bilirubin. Cone-beam volumetric computed tomography (CT) was performed to verify radiographic density of pigmented dental elements. Hounsfield scale measurement did not show changes in radiographic density of dental structures. However, CT scan showed intense dystrophic calcification in the maxillary sinus region. CT scan indicated relevant radiographic findings, with radiopacity of the maxillary sinus due to fungal or non-fungal sinusitis. This case report highlights the presence of radiographic image associated with acute infectious processes that could compromise the systemic state of immunosuppressed patients.
