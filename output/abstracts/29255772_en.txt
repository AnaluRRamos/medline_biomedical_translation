Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic immune-mediated enteropathy driven by gluten and affecting individuals of all ages. The diagnosis of CD in adulthood is emerging and patients often present with nonclassical extraintestinal manifestations. We report the case of a 53-year-old man presenting with neuromuscular symptoms, skin rash, inconspicuous chronic diarrhea, marked weight loss, and biochemical markers of malabsorption. A strong clinical suspicion led to the diagnosis of CD with clinical recovery after the initiation of a gluten-free diet. Clinical presentation with atypical symptoms in adult CD patients is the rule and not the exception. Most of the extraintestinal manifestations depend on background autoimmune phenomena and micronutrient malabsorption. A gluten-free diet re-establishes homeostasis and prevents long-term complications.
