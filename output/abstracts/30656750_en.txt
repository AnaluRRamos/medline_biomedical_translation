Oclacitinib is a Janus-kinase inhibitor that decreases interleukin-31-induced pruritus in cats. At 0.4-0.6 mg/kg/day orally, it decreased pruritus and skin lesions in <50% of allergic cats. To evaluate efficacy and safety of oclacitinib in feline nonflea nonfood-induced hypersensitivity dermatitis (NFNFIHD). Forty cats with NFNFIHD. Cats were randomly assigned to receive oclacitinib (group A, 20 cats, 0.7-1.2 mg/kg) or methylprednisolone (group B, 20 cats, 0.5-1 mg/kg) orally twice daily for 28 days. On day (D)1 and D28, lesions were evaluated using the Scoring Feline Allergic Dermatitis (SCORFAD) scale and owners assessed pruritus using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and quality of life (QoL) questionnaire. Results were analysed by General Linear Mixed Model (P < 0.05). Haematochemical analyses were performed on D1 and D28. In both groups all parameters improved significantly, with no difference at either time point. Group A had a 61% mean SCORFAD and 54% pruritus VAS improvement, compared with 69% and 67% in group B; 70% of cats in group A and 75% in group B achieved a ≥ 50% reduction of pruritus VAS scores; with 60% and 80% of SCORFAD. There were five non-responders in group A and three in group B. The QoL score improved in both groups (25 and 21%). Four of 14 cats had mild increases in kidney function tests (oclacitinib group) and three of 12 cats had elevated alanine transferase (methylprednisolone group). Oclacitinib appears to be effective for treating pruritus and lesions in cats with NFNFIHD, albeit methylprednisolone seemed to perform better.
