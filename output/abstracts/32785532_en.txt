Quantitative study, of a time series analysis, with the database from the Information System of Diseases Notification, referring to cases of CS reported in MG between 2007 and 2015. It was used descriptive statistics, calculation of the incidence rate of CS and polynomial regression model for temporal trend analysis. The results showed that in the period 4,381 cases were registered. The incidence rate ranged from 0.61 to 5.08 per 1,000 live births (LB),with an increase in the temporal trend of the CS incidence coefficient in the period from 2007 to 2015, with an annual rate variation of 30.6% (95% CI: 21.0 - 41.0). There was a predominance of brown-skinned newborns (38.7%), up to 6 days old (94.7%) and the majority (63.6%) did not present any suggestive manifestations of CS, but definitive diagnosis for recent CS (95.2%).
