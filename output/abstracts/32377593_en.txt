In Brazil, urban cleaning professionals play an important role within a context characterized by annual increase of the garbage production. However, the job exposes such workers to various occupational hazards, an issue little discussed in the literature. To identify occupational hazards to which Brazilian solid workers are exposed, as well as factors associated with their minimization. A systematic review of the literature was performed in databases Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO), Latin American and Caribbean Literature in Health Sciences (LILACS), and PubMed. Gray literature was also searched through Google Scholar and included studies published along a ten-year period (2006-2016) in Portuguese, English, and Spanish. Twelve studies were located; the results showed that waste workers were exposed to biological, accidental, chemical, ergonomic, physical, and psychosocial risks. The risks declined with adherence to use of personal protective equipment and guidance for workers, employers, and population. Given the few studies in this field, more evidence-based research is necessary to serve as grounds for the development and implementation of public health policies aiming at reducing occupational risks among the studied population.
