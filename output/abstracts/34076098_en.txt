Colorectal cancer presents high incidence worldwide, but case-fatality is higher in developing countries. The study's objective was to analyze sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with delay in the initiation of treatment for colorectal cancer in hospitals in Brazil. This is a retrospective study of data from hospital cancer registries in Brazil from 2006 to 2015. The target variable is time to initiation of treatment for colorectal cancer and possible associations between sociodemographic variables and clinical factors. The analysis revealed disparities in time to treatment according to sociodemographic strata and geographic regions. Higher odds of treatment delay were associated with age over 50 years, black race/color (OR = 1.50; 95%CI: 1.21-1.84) and brown race/color (OR = 1.28; 95%CI: 1.17-1.42), illiteracy or low schooling (OR = 1.50; 95%CI: 1.19-1.90), and treatment in a city far from the patient's residence (OR = 1.25; 95%CI: 1.14-1.38). For rectal cancer, higher odds of treatment delay were associated with age over 50 years, black (OR = 1.44; 95%CI: 1.20-1.72) or brown race/color (OR = 1.29; 95%CI: 1.19-1.39), illiteracy or low schooling (OR = 1.71; 95%CI: 1.40-2.09), and treatment in a city far from the patient's residence (OR = 1.35; 95%CI: 1.25-1.47). In conclusion, greater attention should be given to reducing the time to initiation of treatment in underprivileged regions and in social strata identified with barriers to timely treatment access.
