This case concerns a male patient complaining of pain and discomfort in his right elbow, associated with decreased range of motion. Elbow radiography showed an osteolytic lesion in the metaphyseal region of the distal humerus and magnetic resonance imaging showed intra-articular tumor formation with swelling that suggested pigmented villonodular synovitis. Arthroscopic treatment was performed in order to obtain a synovial biopsy and then to carry out total synovectomy. Anatomopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis. The patient presented excellent progress through the physiotherapeutic rehabilitation proposed and continued to be asymptomatic 12 months after the operation.
