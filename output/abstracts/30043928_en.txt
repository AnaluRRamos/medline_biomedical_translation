To assess the effectiveness of telephone educational interventions on the duration and exclusiveness of breastfeeding. A systematic review of the literature was conducted including only Randomized Clinical Trials. The exposure factor was an educational intervention via telephone, and the outcomes were duration and exclusiveness of breastfeeding. Literature in Portuguese, English and Spanish published between 2010 and 2016 were searched for in the Cochrane, Lilacs, Medline and Scopus databases. The articles were analyzed through a results synthesis. 241 articles were identified, of which 231 did not meet the inclusion criteria. Therefore, only 10 articles were reviewed. Four studies showed no efficacy related to breastfeeding. Regarding common characteristics, these studies were performed in short periods and in pairs. The others revealed efficacy regarding duration and/or exclusiveness of breastfeeding. The latter were mostly studies with long-term interventions and carried out by nurse lactation consultants. The evidence demonstrates that the telephone is a viable technology for promoting breastfeeding, representing an alternative for the health units and health professionals that can contribute to mother-baby care.
