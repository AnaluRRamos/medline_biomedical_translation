This paper aims to identify the association between overweight and the nutritional composition of human milk. A systematic review was performed by searching on PubMed, Virtual Health Library (BVS), EMBASE, Web of Science, and SCOPUS databases, from May to June 2018, using keywords 'Human Milk' AND 'Overweight' OR 'Obesity' OR 'Body Mass Index'. The bibliographic search returned 435 papers after the duplicates were removed. Of this total, 12 papers were selected for abstract reading, and nine works were incorporated into this systematic review. Eight papers showed that overweight increased the total concentration of lipids or glucose or macronutrient fractions, and only one study found no association between overweight and the nutritional composition of human milk. Most works selected evidenced that obesity changed the total concentration of lipids and their fractions. Thus, we recommend that women's weight and height be evaluated in the pregestational visit to identify and monitor nutritional deviations, contributing to weight adequacy before pregnancy and assisting in the production of milk with adequate nutritional composition.
