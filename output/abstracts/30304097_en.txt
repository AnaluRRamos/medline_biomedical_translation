to evaluate the epidemiological data of patients operated on due to vascular trauma at a referral hospital in Par√° state, to determine the variables that increase the risk of death, and to make a comparative analysis with the results previously published by the same institution. an analytical retrospective study was performed through data collection from patients operated due to vascular injuries, between March 2013 and March 2017. Demographic and epidemiological data, such as the mechanism and topography of the lesion, distance between the trauma site and the hospital, and type of treatment and complications, were analyzed. Multivariate analysis and logistic regression studies were performed, to evaluate significant dependence between some variables and death occurrence. two hundred and eighty eight patients with 430 lesions were studied; 92.7% were male, 49.7% were between 25 and 49 years old; 47.2% of all injuries were caused by firearm projectiles; 47.2% of the lesions were located in the upper limbs, 42.7% in the lower limbs, 8% in the cervical region, 3.1% in the thoracic region, and 0.7% in the abdominal region; 52.8% of the patients were hospitalized for seven days or less. Amputation was required in 6.9% of patients and there was mortality in 7.93% of the cases. distances greater than 200km were associated with prolonged hospitalization and greater probability of limb amputation. Significant correlation between death occurrence and arterial injury, vascular injury in the cervical region, and vascular injury in the thoracic region was found.
