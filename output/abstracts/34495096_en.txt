The objective was to characterize sociodemographic, behavioral, and clinical aspects in young Brazilian military recruits according to prevalence of syphilis. This was a descriptive study based on a nationwide population-based survey in 2016 with a probabilistic sample of military recruits 17 to 22 years of age. A confidential self-applied questionnaire was used. Blood samples were drawn from participants for treponemal and non-treponemal syphilis tests. Descriptive statistical techniques were used to estimate syphilis prevalence rates and distribution of frequencies between the target variables, considering 95% confidence intervals (95%CI), after weighting the data. Of the total of 37,282 participants, 73.7% were sexually initiated. Prevalence rates for lifetime and confirmed syphilis were 1.6% and 1.1%, respectively. The following population variables showed higher prevalence of syphilis: lack of Internet access at home; initiation of sexual activity before 14 years of age; men who have sex with men; more than five sexual partners; having received presents, drugs, or other incentives in exchange for sex; and prior history of symptoms of sexually transmissible infections. An increase was observed in syphilis in Brazilian military recruits when compared to previous surveys. This increase emphasizes the importance of this sentinel population for performing active surveillance in order to support healthcare strategies for youth, including in the school system.
