In an admixed population of older Cubans, the incidence and association of APOE and sociodemographic risk factors with dementia incidence was estimated. A single-phase survey (baseline) of all over 65-year-olds residing in seven catchment areas in Cuba (n=2944) was conducted between 2003 and 2007. Dementia diagnosis was established according to DSM-IV and 10/66 criteria. APOE genotype was determined in 2520 participants. An incidence wave was conducted 4.5 years after cohort inception in order to estimate incidence and associations with sociodemographic risk factors of the APOE ε4 genotype. The incidence rate of DSM IV dementia was 9.0 per 1000 person-years (95% CI 7.2-11.3) and of 10/66 dementia was 20.5 per 1000 person-years (95% CI, 17.6-23.5). Older age, a family history of dementia and APOE ε4 genotype were independent risk factors for incident 10/66 dementia. APOE genotype was associated cross-sectionally with dementia prevalence, but the effect on the incidence of dementia was attenuated, and only apparent among those in the youngest age group. The incidence of dementia in the older Cuban population is relatively high and similar to levels reported in Europe and North-America. The study showed that the relationship between APOE ε4 and incident dementia is stronger in the younger-old than the older-old and that this change must be taken into account in models of dementia.
