The aim of this study was to review the scientific publications on cognitive rehabilitation in Alzheimer's disease by year published and methodology employed. The principles of systematic review by the Brazilian Cochrane Center were used. Reviews conducted by this Center were identified together with those held on the LILACS and Medline scientific databases. Nine levels of evidence were considered for analysis and a total of 37 articles were found. The results showed a growing number of publications from 2001 onwards, with majority being published early this decade. Few studies have been published on cognitive rehabilitation, with an average of three articles published per year during the study period (1985-2008). The highest levels of evidence were observed in the more recently published studies. Cognitive rehabilitation can yield greater benefits in rehabilitating patients when associated with other forms of intervention. The latest studies demonstrating greater scientific evidence concluded that results remain limited and that further studies on the topic are needed.
