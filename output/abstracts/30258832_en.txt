Synovial chondromatosis is a benign arthropathy rarely seen in diarthrodial joints. Extra-articular bilateral symmetrical synovial chondromatosis of shoulder is the rarest variety. The diagnosis is established with the help of imaging modalities and histopathological examinations. This report describes a case of a 39-year-old woman who presented with symmetrical, progressively increasing swelling over the bilateral shoulder region, of 12-18 months duration, with dull ache and restricted movements of the shoulder joints. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasonography (USG) revealed large bilateral subacromial-subdeltoid bursal swelling with loose floating bodies. Surgical excision of extensive bilateral bursa was performed at four weeks of interval. Histopathological examination revealed synovial chondromatosis on either side. Postoperative recovery occurred without complications.
