Oral rehabilitation with dental prosthesis was mandated by national oral health policy in Brazil, due to the high prevalence of total teeth loss and low use of dental prosthesis among the elderly. There is a pressing need to assess the impact of this rehabilitation policy. An attempt was therefore made to investigate if the dental service used was one of the factors associated with the use of total dental prosthesis among the elderly. To achieve this, a cross-sectional study using a probabilistic sample of elderly (60 years and above) urban-area residents of a small city was conducted by qualified examiners. Descriptive, bivariate and multiple (logistic regression/odds ratio - OR) analyses were conducted on 287 elderly people, of which 186 (64.8%) used dental prosthesis. The use of total dental prosthesis was associated with a higher probability of being attended by private dental services (OR = 4.19; p < 0.001) and the presence of lesions on the palate (OR = 7.52; p = 0.002). Conversely, it was associated with lower probability in ages greater than or equal to 73 years (OR = 0.52; p = 0.023) and among those with impairment of OHIP-14 (OR = 0.20; p = 0.002) in the physical disability dimension. The use of total dental prosthesis was associated with the type of dental service used by the elderly, it being greater among private service users.
