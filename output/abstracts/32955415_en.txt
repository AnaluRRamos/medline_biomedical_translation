Hematocolpos is an obstruction of the menstrual flow due to an anomaly of the genital tract, with imperforate hymen being the most common one. It is an uncommon condition, with a prevalence of 1:1000 - 1:16 000. It is usually an asymptomatic condition until the onset of menarche, when there is accumulation of blood in the vagina (hematocolpos) or in the uterus (hematometra). A rare symptom of hematocolpos could be urinary retention. Our case report is about a 12-year-old girl, with no menarche and Tanner stage M4/P5, who was admitted to our emergency department with abdominal pain and urinary retention. A brief review of this rare condition is presented, in order to remind clinicians about its existence, so that it can be diagnosed and treated as quickly as possible.
