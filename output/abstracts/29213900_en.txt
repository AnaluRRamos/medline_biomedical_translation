Visuospatial processing is a fundamental aspect in human cognition, belonging to a complex and intricate network. It is, in other words, one of the building blocks of an individual's identity and behavior. To allow an overall and updated review of visuospatial processing and its related events, in light of new techniques and evidence, focusing on basic concepts of higher cortical functions, its pathways and associated systems. The study was conducted based on the national and international databases LILACS, MEDLINE, ScieLo and Pubmed; using the search word 'visuospatial' in combination with 'pathway', 'processing', 'function', 'fMRI' and 'attention'. A total of 77 references deemed relevant for its historical, conceptual or updated relevance were selected out of 1222 retrieved; including English, Spanish and Portuguese languages. A critical review was carried out and many new aspects discussed. A new functioning and construction of sight processing is being shaped, culminating now in a model based on dynamic and integrated interactions between pathways and systems.
