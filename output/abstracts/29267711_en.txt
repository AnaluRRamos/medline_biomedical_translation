The Health Promotion paradigm led to the acknowledgment of health due to factors linked to the social, political and economic contexts. In Brazil, health inequities are one of the most striking features of the health situation, challenging the effectiveness of intersectoral policies. This study aimed to understand the perception of socially vulnerable community dwellers of the problems that interfere with the health conditions and the coping strategies used. The methodology consisted of a participatory research based on the participatory diagnosis conducted with 31 key informants from the community studied in Fortaleza, Cear√°, Brazil. As a result, participants evidenced that the community has health issues due to weak intersectoral actions (infrastructure, public safety, basic sanitation, garbage collection, among others) and that they seek to address them through social mobilization actions and institutional support. Thus, Participatory Diagnosis is thought to increase social involvement with health promotion and problem solving and contributes to ensuring the right to the city to all its residents.
