To map internal and external factors in an emergency care unit that interfere with interprofessional communicative practice. This is a single case study carried out in the emergency care unit of a general hospital. Data were collected through participant observation, document analysis, and semi-structured interviews, and were triangulated and subjected to thematic analysis, out of categories defined a priori, based on the SWOT matrix. Twenty-two health care professionals participated in the study. As for the strengths and opportunities, it was found that professionals understand the importance of communication as a safety measure, and they use the shift change and written communication to share information. However, overcrowding, work overload, the lack of behaviors standardization, the inexperience of professionals, and the deficit in the interprofessional relationship are factors that hinder effective communication. The fragile interprofessional communicative process hampers interaction and information sharing for shared decisions that allow the safe continuity of care.
