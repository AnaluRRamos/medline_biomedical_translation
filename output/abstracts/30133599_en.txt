The objective of this investigation was to check equity in coverage/complementation of health expenses by the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) for people with signs of common mental disorders, in 2008, in the city of São Paulo, Brazil. Cross-sectional study with data from the 2008 São Paulo Health Survey. Individuals aged 16 or older and with signs of common mental disorders were selected and evaluated with the Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20). The following aspects were analyzed: demand for SUS, coverage of health expenses by SUS, and health expenses in the previous month, withal according to sociodemographic and health conditions. The search for SUS services was lower among white people with higher per capita incomes, in a stable union, and with higher education degrees. Coverage by SUS was lower for people aged between 45 and 59 years and aged 60 years or older, with higher per capita incomes, with high or technical school, and college degrees. Subjects who spent more on family health were 60 years or older, white, with high per capita income, in a stable union, and with a college degree. Among people with signs of common mental disorders, SUS mainly services and covers the expenses of the poorer population with lower educational level; therefore coverage is unequal and favors who needs it the most. However, considering age, inequity became explicit, since SUS was shown to offer wider coverage of health expenses to the youngest population.
