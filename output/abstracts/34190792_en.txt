This documentary study examines official texts related to physical education in legislation and decrees from Brazil's imperial period (1822-1889) to trace the initial steps of professionals in this area within the civil and military context of Brazilian society, before they were recognized as a professional category. We found that unlike intellectual efforts, practical work was less attractive, which made it difficult for these professionals to work exclusively and maintain stability in this area. These elements were obstacles to more organized demands from physical education that were required for professionalization.
