Anencephaly is a malformation characterized by the total or partial absence of the brain, and Brazil records the fourth largest number of births of anencephalic fetuses in the world. Fetal anencephaly is associated with a more significant number of maternal complications. As of 2012, women with anencephalic gestation were empowered with the right to carry the pregnancy to term or terminate it, if they so desired, without any judicial authorization. Objectives: to understand the experiences of women with fetal anencephaly and to identify the determinant factors for interrupting the gestation or not. This is a qualitative study using the Life Narratives method with 12 women over 18 years old diagnosed with an anencephalic fetus, who interrupted gestation or delivery in a public maternity hospital in Rio de Janeiro. Data were collected between June and November 2016, and the process was finalized when the narrative patterns reached progressive saturation from the recurrences. The statements that emerged following floating and in-depth reading were articulated in Narrative Nuclei, and data comparative and comprehensive analysis was performed. The reports brought to light the intense experiences of these women, as well as the weaknesses existing concerning care and the pregnancy termination issue.
