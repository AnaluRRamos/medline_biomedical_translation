The study analyzed factors associated with high LDL-Cholesterol in Brazilian population. This is a cross-sectional study with laboratory data from 8,534 individuals collected in National Health Survey were analyzed. The prevalence levels of LDL-Cholesterol <130 and ≥ 130 mg/dL were calculated. The outcome variable was high LDL-Cholesterol (≥ 130 mg/dL) and explanatory variables were sociodemographic, anthropometric, lifestyle, chronic diseases and self-rated health. To Poisson regression was used and estimated prevalence ratios (PR) with 95% confidence levels (CI) to verify associations. The prevalence of high LDL-Cholesterol was 18.58%. In the final multivariate model were associated with the outcome: 30 to 44 years (PR 1.99; CI 1.58-2.54), 45 to 59 years (PR 2.89; CI 2.29-3.64), 60 years or more (PR 2.90; CI 2.29-3.68), living in the Northeast Region (PR 1.16; CI 1.02 - 1.32), overweight (PR 1.32; CI 1.15-1.51), obesity (PR 1.41; CI 1.19-1.65) or anemia (PR 0.66; CI 0.54-0.80). The LDL-Cholesterol was associated with aging, overweight, obesity, live in the Northeast and anemia. The monitoring of LDL levels is relevant, due to the increased risk with age, and can guide the adopting healthy lifestyles and diagnosis in places with lower access.
