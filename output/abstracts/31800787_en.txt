This study aimed to assess the association between prevalence of excess weight and obesity and overall and disease-specific mortality rates in Brazilian state capitals and Argentine provinces. This was an ecological study with secondary data, where the principal exposures were prevalence rates for excess weight and obesity, estimated with data from Brazil's Vigitel survey (Risk and Protective Factors Surveillance System for Chronic Non-Communicable Diseases Through Telephone Interveiew) in 2014 and Argentina's National Risk Factor Survey in 2013. Overall and specific mortality rates for the year 2015 were obtained from the Brazilian Mortality Information System in the Brazilian Health Informatics Department and the Division of Health Statistics and Information of the Argentine Ministry of Health. Brazilian mortality rates were standardized with the age structure of the Argentine population as the standard. Crude and adjusted linear regressions were used to assess the association between the prevalence rates for excess weight and obesity and the overall and specific mortality rates. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, prevalence of obesity was positively associated with the overall mortality rate both in Brazil (β = 0.18; 95%CI: 0.01; 0.35) and in Argentina (β = 0.06; 95%CI: 0.01; 0.13). There was no association with the specific cardiovascular and cancer mortality rates. We conclude that the Brazilian state capitals and Argentine provinces with the highest prevalence of obesity present higher overall mortality rates, while this association was inconsistent for the specific rates.
