to present a low-cost model for bleeding control training with the use of a tourniquet and the results of the training evaluation. low-cost and easy-to-purchase materials, such as upholstery foam, ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) sheet, plastic propulsion pump, saline container, water, school paint, serum equipment, rubber tubing for tourniquet, and a leg and an arm of a ghost mannequin, were used. In the model assembly, we created an active bleeding simulation system, which could only be controlled with the correct application of the tourniquet. The model was submitted to professional and academic evaluation. the model was similar to human anatomy, proved to be practical in the bleeding control training with the use of a tourniquet, and had low cost. the model for bleeding control training had excellent acceptability, was considered viable for educational purposes of tourniquet use, and had low cost.
