This paper aimed to identify the thinking currents used for scientific production on health councils and conferences, from 1990 to 2017. This is an integrative review of literature carried out at the SciELO, LILACS and CAPES journals portals that resulted in the selection of 152 papers. They were analyzed by year of publication, author's institutional origin, dissemination media, object and type of study and theoretical approach. We identified that a gradual increase occurred in the number of publications over the study period and most empirical studies (92.8%) do not explicitly state the use of any theoretical approach in data analysis. The structuralist, post-structuralist and neo-institutionalist approaches used were mediated by a theoretical model, medium-range theories and concepts of authors of the European, North American and Latin American traditions. The knowledge produced about health council and conference in Brazil may benefit even more from the density of theoretical approaches to social and political sciences.
