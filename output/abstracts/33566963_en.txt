Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Biological aging has been associated with the occurrence of adverse cardiovascular outcomes; however, the underlying mechanism of this process remains unknown. This study sought to evaluate if peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) senescence and endothelial biomarkers could influence cardiovascular (CV) risk and be suitable markers for the early detection of cardiovascular diseases in adults. In this cross-sectional study patients free of CVD were classified as lower (n=32) and higher Interheart Risk (IHR) scores (n=28). PBMC senescence was assessed by estimating the telomerase activity (TA) and detecting the presence of senescent cells and endothelial dysfunction by estimating the concentration of nitrite and nitrate and of total antioxidant capacity (TAC). Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS version 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). All p-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. PBMC senescence 0.95 [p-value = 0.0001; 95% CI (0.874-1.026)] was a significant predictor of patients with higher IHR scores with a cut-off value of 21.65 with a sensitivity and specificity of 92% and 88% respectively. PBMC senescence, nitrite and nitrate and TA were found to be independently associated with high IHR scores. PBMC senescence, TA and nitrite, and nitrate status are suitable measures to predict high cardiovascular risk in adults with CV risk. Nevertheless, long-term follow-up studies are needed to confirm these findings. (Arq Bras Cardiol. 2021; 116(1):37-47)
