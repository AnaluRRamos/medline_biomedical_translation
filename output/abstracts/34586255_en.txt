The global burden and the prevalence of systemic arterial hypertension (SAH) have increased over the last two decades, especially in low- and middle-income countries, and are a concern to health authorities. This study analyzed the prevalence of SAH reported by Brazilian adults in 2008, 2013, and 2019, and individual disease control in 2013 and 2019. Data from the National Household Sample Survey (2008) and National Health Survey (2013-2019) were employed. We calculated the disease's prevalence ratios using Poisson regression, adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics. Regarding health care and PHC organization indicators, we calculated proportions by gender, age group, ethnicity, and region. The results reveal persistent regional inequalities, with lower prevalence in the North and Northeast and higher prevalence in the Southeast and South. While the health care access and use indicators are positive, reflecting PHC improvements in recent years, we highlight the importance of adopting multifaceted SAH prevention and control strategies in the country.
