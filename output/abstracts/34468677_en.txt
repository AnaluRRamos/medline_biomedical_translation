The aim of the present study was to identify dietary patterns and associations with socioeconomic characteristics, lifestyle, nutritional status, lipid profile and inflammatory profile in adolescents. A cross-sectional study was conducted with a probabilistic sample using baseline data (2014) from the Longitudinal Study on Sedentary Behavior, Physical Activity, Eating Habits and Adolescent Health. A total of 1,438 adolescents (10 to 14 years old) from public schools in the city of Jo√£o Pessoa, Brazil, participated in the study. Data were collected on socioeconomic characteristics, nutritional status, lifestyle and the results of biochemical tests. Dietary data were obtained using the 24-hour recall method and dietary patterns were identified by exploratory factor analysis. Associations of interest were estimated using multiple logistic regression. Three dietary patterns were found: 'Traditional', 'Snacks' and 'Western'. These patterns were associated with age, socioeconomic status, parental education and lifestyle. The 'Traditional' pattern was associated lower adiposity and a better lipid profile. However, with the increase in age, greater frequencies of the 'Snacks' and 'Western' patterns were found. The present findings underscore the need for strategies that encourage healthy behaviors.
