To analyze the network of correlations between the realms of the Effor t-Reward Imbalance (ERI) model, resilience, and quality of life among military police officers. This is a cross-sectional study conducted with 258 police officers from the Special Opera tions Battalion of the Military Police in a city in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The scales of the ERI model, resilience, and World Health Quality of Life (WHOQOL-bref) assessed psychosocial stress, resilience, and quality of life. Descriptive and analytical statistics were performed em ploying the network analysis. The realms of the ERI model and resilience correlated with all the WHOQOL's realms (p<0.001). The network model showed a negative association between effort, overcommitment, and physical and environmental realms. The environmental realm was positively associated with reward, while resilience was positively associated with the general, physical, and psychological realms. We concluded that psychosocial stress interferes in the quality of life of military police officers, and resi lience may work as a protective factor.
