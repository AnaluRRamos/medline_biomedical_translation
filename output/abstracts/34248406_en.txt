The main purpose of this work was to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of reconstructive procedures applied in upper limb soft tissue injuries according to their location. The study involved 94 male and 22 female patients (116 total) operated between April 2001 and November 2017 due to traumatic injuries in a upper limb. Individuals were evaluated considering their age, sex, etiology, reconstruction area , applied methodology and complications. The finger injuries were excluded. The performed reconstruction procedures include 29 skin grafts; six advancement flaps; seven rotation flaps; 33 pedicled fasciocutaneous flaps, 9 free fasciocutaneous flaps; 5 pedicled muscle flaps; 12 free muscle flaps, three pedicled musculocutaneous flaps; one free musculocutaneous flap; 11 neurovascular free flaps. Reconstructive procedures in the upper limbs are diverse, varying from skin grafting to free flaps. The indication of the best option depends on the type of injurie and the surgeon. The final goal is to reach the best functional result combined with the lowest possible morbidity. <b><i>Level of Evidence IV, Case series.</i></b>
