Models for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography training allow practice with an expert feedback and without risks. A method to rapidly exchange the papilla can be time saving and accelerate the learning curve. To demonstrate a newly method of rapid exchange papilla in ex-vivo models to teach retrograde cholangiopancreatography advanced procedures. A new model of ex-vivo papilla was developed in order to resemble live conditions of procedures as cannulation, papilotomy or fistula-papilotomy, papiloplasty, biliary dilatation, plastic and metallic stentings. The ex-vivo model of papilla rapid exchange is feasible and imitates with realism conditions of retrograde cholangiopancreatography procedures. This model allows an innovative method of advanced endoscopic training.
