The information was collected and analyzed through meetings registration, where strategies were discussed to enable the systematic application of the instrument in the institution. For the construction, it was considered a consensus of 100% among the experts. The computerized parameter guide was elaborated with a description of what to evaluate in each item of the Perroca's instrument, standardizing the filling by the nurses. The parameter guide made it possible to minimize the subjectivity of the evaluators when applying the classification instrument, provided guiding elements to fill it in and qualified the nursing care benchmarking.
