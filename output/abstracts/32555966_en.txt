To analyze the results of morbidity and survival after curative and palliative surgery in recurrent cervical cancer patients who underwent chemoradiation as their primary treatment. Another goal was to assess the factors associated with curative and non-curative procedures. This was a retrospective cohort consisting of patients undergoing surgery curative and palliative from January 2011 to December 2017 at a high complexity oncology center. Outcome of morbidity was reported according to the Clavien-Dindo classification, and survival analysis was carried out using the Kaplan-Meir method. To assess the factors associated with the procedures, a univariate analysis using the Mann-Whitney U test was performed. Two radical hysterectomies, three pelvic exenterations with curative intent, and five palliatives pelvic exenterations were performed. In the curative group, there were major complications in 40% of the cases, and the median survival time was 16 months. In the palliative group, there were major complications in 60% of the cases, and the median survival time was 5 months. Advanced staging (p-value= 0.02), symptoms (p-value=0.04), tumor size greater than five centimeters (p-value=0.04), and more than three organs involved (p-value=0.003) were factors significantly associated with non-curative surgery. The morbidity rates of this study were higher in palliative group, and the median survival time was lower in the palliative group than the curative group, but this difference in survival was not statistically significant. Advanced stage, symptoms, tumor size and number of organs involved are factors that should be taken into consideration when indicating surgical salvage.
