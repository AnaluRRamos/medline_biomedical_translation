To evaluate the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of knee injuries in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) practitioners. Cross-sectional study, using a mixed questionnaire, based on the Referred Morbidity Index. 198 amateur and professional BJJ fighters, of both sexes, aged between 18 and 60 years, participated in the study. The majority (88%) of the fighters had only one knee injury (p < 0.001). In total, 29.8% proportion of knee injuries (p < 0.001) was identified, which were mainly from the medial collateral ligament (38%), caused by a sprain mechanism (86%) and conservative treatment (65%). A high prevalence of knee injuries in JJB fighters was found, compared to other sports that also perform rotational movements and have great body contact, such as mixed martial arts (MMA), judo, soccer, basketball and handball. Some JJB strikes, such as the key and the projection, can cause greater knee joint stress, both in the attacking fighter and in the opponent. The knowledge of the epidemiological characteristics of sports injuries is important in the elaboration of prevention and training protocols more specific to the sport and for the understanding of the complex mechanisms involved with this outcome in sport. <b><i>Level of Evidence IV, Case Series.</i></b>
