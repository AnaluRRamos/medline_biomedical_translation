The scope of this study was to assess the evolution of costs for purchasing the basic food basket associated with the purchasing power of the minimum wage, besides measuring the availability per capita in Brazilian households of the items comprised in the food basket. Additionally, adequacy of the nutritional composition and diet quality based on daily consumption of food basket items was evaluated. The results obtained indicate the existence of periods of price increase for the acquisition of the food basket items, as well as the inability of the minimum wage to meet the cost of such food supplies. It was verified that the diets based on the consumption of food basket items have a higher calorie and sodium content than the recommendations for adults, as well as insufficient amounts of calcium, potassium, and vitamin A. The evaluation of the quality of the diets indicated low amounts of fruit, vegetables, cereals in the diet consisting of the items of the food baskets, with excess calories from fats and added sugar being verified. In view of such evidence, a review of the composition of the food baskets is recommended in order to meet basic nutritional requirements in food for the Brazilian population.
