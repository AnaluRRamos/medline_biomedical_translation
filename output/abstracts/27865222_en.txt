Female genital tuberculosis remains a major health problem in developing countries and is an important cause of infertility. As symptoms, laboratory data and physical findings are non-specific, its diagnosis can be difficult. We describe a case of a 39-year-old woman suffering from peri-umbilical pain and increased abdominal size for one year, anorexia, asthenia, weight loss, occasionally dysuria and dyspareunia, and four months amenorrhea. Laboratory data revealed cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) level of 132.3 U/mL, erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 42 mm/h, and gamma-globulins of 2.66 g/dL. Computed tomography scan showed loculated ascites. It was initially suspected a carcinomatous origin, but ascites evaluation was negative for malignant cells. Magnetic resonance imaging from another hospital showed endometrial heterogeneity. Therefore, an endometrial biopsy was performed demonstrating an inflammatory infiltrate with giant cells of type Langhans and bacteriological culture identified Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
