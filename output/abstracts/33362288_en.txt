Determine patterns of tuberculosis (TB) incidence indicators and number of deaths from TB within the framework of target 3.3 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and their correlation with social determinants. Ecological study methodology was used, in which the population is the unit of analysis. Social determinants were analyzed using a negative binomial regression model and strength of association. In the Americas, there was an average annual reduction in the TB incidence rate of 0.3% from 2009 to 2018; however, from 2015 to 2018, the rate increased, from 27.6 to 28.8 per 100,000 population. With regard to social determinants, the groups of countries with the lowest human development index (HDI) and gross domestic product (GDP) have a higher incidence of TB. TB risk in the country with the lowest HDI is six times that of the country with the highest HDI. At the current rate of reduction in the incidence rate and number of deaths from TB, the Region of the Americas will not meet the targets in the SDGs and in the End TB Strategy. Rapid implementation and expansion of interventions for TB prevention and control are required to attain the targets. This involves, among other actions, reducing access barriers to diagnosis and treatment and strengthening initiatives to address social determinants.
