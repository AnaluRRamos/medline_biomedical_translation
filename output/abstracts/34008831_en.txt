In 2019, an article published in the European Heart Journal recognized for the first time heart failure (HF) with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)â‰¥ 65% as a new HF phenotype, heart failure with supra-normal left ventricular ejection fraction (HFsnEF), with the main purpose of promoting research on this new category. They analyzed mortality in people with HF and found that there was a u-shaped relationship between mortality and LVEF. Accordingly, HFsnEF patients had a higher all-cause mortality compared with other patients diagnosed with HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). This article describes the current situation of HFsnEF and discusses future perspectives based on the preliminary results of our group. To better treat patients with HFsnEF, it is fundamental that cardiologists and physicians understand the differences and similarities of this new phenotype.
