Pulmonary embolism is an important cause of cardiovascular death. Inferior vena cava filters have been shown to be effective for prevention of this condition. To determine the safety, performance and efficacy of a new inferior vena cava filter in an ovine model. BKone1 filters are self-centering with over-the-wire deployment, have three filtering regions and are made from nickel-titanium alloy. Eight of these filters were implanted in 8 sheep. The sheep were divided into 4 groups of two animals (A and B) and the number of clots injected differed by group. Two clots were injected in group 2, four in group 3, eight in group 4 and zero clots in group 1. A animals underwent euthanasia soon after the procedure and B animals were observed for 30 days and then euthanized after a control cavography. All inferior vena cavas were processed for histological examination. Clots were prepared in a metal mold, sectioned and then radiopaque markers were inserted. Clot capture was analyzed by identifying the radiopaque marker on fluoroscopy. No clot migration was observed during follow-up. Control cavographies showed patent inferior vena cavas. Pathological examination indicated little inflammatory tissue response. All clots were captured in the condition with 2 clots, only one clot was missed in the group injected with 4 clots and in the condition of 8 clots, they were partly captured. The filters were deployed safely. There was a reduction in efficacy as the number of blood clots increased.
