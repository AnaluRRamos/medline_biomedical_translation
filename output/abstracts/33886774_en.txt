The relationship between people and work has a direct impact on quality of life and health. The objective of this article is to compare perceived levels of Quality of Working Life (QWL) across three different groups of professionals. Cross-sectional study with a random sample of 172 hospital workers (37.9Â±10.3 years; 73.8% women). Participants filled out the Quality of Working Life Assessment Inventory (QWL-AI). The data was analyzed using Anova and Tukey's test. Statistically significant differences were found between the groups in 36.4% of the items assessing work conditions, 35.7% of the items assessing professional growth and recognition (p<0.05), 12.5% of the items assessing socioprofessional workplace relationships, 11.1% of the items assessing work organization, and 10% of the items assessing link between work and social life. Overall, 21.7% of the items showed significant differences between groups. We found significant differences in perceived QWL between the different groups, suggesting that QWL interventions should be tailored to the address the specific needs and demands of different sectors and departments to be effective.
