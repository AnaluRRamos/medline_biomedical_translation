To present the results of our cases of Dupuytren's disease treated with regional selective fasciectomy in light of the literature. Patients diagnosed with Dupuytren's contracture and surgically treated with regional selective fasciectomy at our institution with adequate follow-up data were included in the study. All patients were routinely followed after surgery to assess results and complications. QuickDASH scoring was used to evaluate the patients and recurrences and complications were recorded. Twenty-one hands of 19 patients (13 males, 6 females) who underwent surgery and received adequate follow-up were retrospectively evaluated. Mean patient age was 65.8 (range: 41 to 86) and the mean follow-up period was 48.2 months (range: 24 to 86). Fourteen (66.6%) hands had excellent results, five (23%) hands had good results and two (9.4%) had fair results. The mean QuickDASH score for the patients at the final follow-up was 6.58 (range: 0 to 20.4). Our study results demonstrated that regional selective fasciectomy is a reliable and efficient method to treat Dupuytren's disease with low rates of complications and recurrence and the technique can be considered the gold standard. <b><i>Level of Evidence IV, Case Series.</i></b>
