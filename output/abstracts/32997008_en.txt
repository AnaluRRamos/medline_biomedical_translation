This paper aims to analyze the trend of tuberculosis (TB) in Brazilian indigenous people from 2011 to 2017. This ecological study was carried out with all new TB cases in indigenous people reported in the Notifiable Diseases Information System during the 2011-2017 period. Thematic maps were prepared to monitor the spatial-temporal evolution of TB in the indigenous population each year, and the Prais-Winsten generalized linear regression model was used to analyze the trend. A total of 6,520 TB cases were reported in indigenous people during the study period. The overall incidence of TB in Brazilian indigenous people for the period was 109/100,000 inhabitants. In the analysis by region of the country, the highest incidence occurred in the Midwest, North, and Southeast regions. In the UF analysis, the highest incidence was found in Mato Grosso, São Paulo, Rondônia, Mato Grosso do Sul, Acre, Maranhão, Pará, and Rio de Janeiro. The trend of the disease in the indigenous was stable both in the country and in most of its regions and UFs. TB disproportionately affects Brazilian indigenous people, and this study can contribute to the elaboration and strengthening of more specific control actions by identifying priority regions and UFs.
