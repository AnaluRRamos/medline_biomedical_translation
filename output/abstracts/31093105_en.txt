This report contributes towards the monitoring and evaluation of the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) Policy on Research for Health (CD49/10), specifically, how it has been used by Member States and how it has influenced their policies, strategies, research, and relevant stakeholders. This cross-sectional study examined the frequency, method of utilization, region of interest or 'scope,' and rationale behind citing the Policy in PAHO/WHO documents, databases, government websites, and internal documents. The extent of utilization was measured through an ordinal scale; the country or region of interest was systematically extracted. Of the 993 documents that were identified through the search strategy, 95 met the inclusion criteria. There was a significant relationship between type of document and scope (Ï‡<sup>2</sup> = 69.5; <i>P</i> < 0.001), with web pages and scientific articles covering the Americas more frequently mentioning the Policy. The Policy was most often used at the country level in government documents and at the regional level in webpages and journal articles. Although the Policy has been utilized by several countries, many countries have yet to integrate it with their national health research initiatives. Additional research should focus on understanding why Policy utilization differs among countries. To promote better cohesion across sectors and levels of governance, researchers and policymakers should seize opportunities to integrate the Policy with the research process, research governance, and policy development. The protocol developed for this study can be applied to similar analyses of other PAHO/WHO policies to gain a greater understanding of their influence.
