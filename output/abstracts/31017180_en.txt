to describe the epidemiological profile of thoracic trauma in the region of Foz do Rio Itajai, in the state of Santa Catarina, Brazil. observational, descriptive and prospective study performed through the collection of data starting with a form elaborated by researchers and filled in by the team in charge of a reference hospital between June 2017 and May 2018. one hundred and nineteen forms from victims of thoracic trauma were analyzed, constituted of 70.5% male patients and 29.4% female patients, with an average of 39.8 years of age. Medical care happened mainly in daytime (67.9%), 30.2% of patients arriving by their own means, and 52.9% of patients one hour after suffering trauma. As to admission exams, most victims only went through chest X-ray (67.2%). There was a prevalence of closed thoracic trauma (89%), whose main cause was motorcycle accidents (35.2%) and the predominant lesion was rib fracture (42%). Most patients (53.8%) went through a conservative treatment. The average admission time was 2.6 days and the death rate was 5%. the profile of patients with thoracic trauma in Itajai comprises young men, admitted during the day, most of them presenting rib fracture, with closed thoracic trauma due to a road traffic accident involving a motorcycle. Chest X-ray were used to confirm most of the diagnoses, and there was a prevalence for conservative treatment. The admission time and the death rate were smaller than those cited in medical literature, which can be explained by the high index of exclusive muscular lesions.
