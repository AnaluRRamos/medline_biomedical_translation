Teeth with developmental defects of enamel (DDE) have porous and/or uneven enamel, making them more susceptible to the build-up of oral biofilm and development of caries and periodontal diseases. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to determine the prevalence of DDE and associated factors among children and adolescents living in a Quilombola community in the Northeast of Brazil. The study population was census-based and comprised individuals aged three to 14 years. The children's parents/guardians answered a questionnaire devised to collect information on socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, health problems during pregnancy and illnesses during early childhood. DDE was diagnosed using the modified DDE index. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and Poisson regression with robust standard errors (p<0.05). A total of 406 individuals were examined. DDE prevalence was 80.5%: 42.2% in deciduous teeth and 61.1% in permanent teeth. There was an association between presence of DDE and age (PR=1.09, 95% CI=1.01-1.17), use of antibiotics during pregnancy (PR=1.14, 95% CI=1.07-1.22) and reported malnutrition during early childhood (PR=1.12; 95% CI=1.03-1.22). The findings reveal high prevalence of DDE among children and adolescents living in the Quilombola community. Associated factors were older age, use of antibiotics during pregnancy and malnutrition during early childhood.
