This is a qualitative, descriptive-analytical study developed in a primary health care facility organized by the ESF. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with five health professionals: two doctors, a nurse, and two community health workers (ACS). The interview's guiding topics were respondent data (name, gender, age, professional category, and seniority in the service); elderly care; care to relatives; perception of the experience of extreme situations in the elderly monitoring; and challenges in the ESF in assisting older adults. Representations related to ESF professionals are directly related to the position held. The ACS are appointed as the facility's thermometer and eyes. Doctors perceive a great demand and see themselves as biomedical knowledge holders and medication prescribers. Nursing is perceived as a professional mediator between ACS and doctors. The walk-in demands of older adults and their families continue to be sustained by the tripod doctor, equipment (tests and procedures), and medication. As family hardships comprise dementia, the perception of care as a burden, and the socioeconomic constraints are intensifying aspects of dementia. The creation of a bond between professionals, relatives, and older adults was perceived as an emotional health care device fundamental for monitoring dementia cases.
