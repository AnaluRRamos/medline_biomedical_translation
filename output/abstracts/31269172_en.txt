To assess adherence to best practices in labor and childbirth care by doctors, nurses, obstetric nursing residents, and obstetric medical residents working in public hospitals in the Federal District of Brazil. A cross-sectional study was conducted with care providers working in 11 public hospitals in the Federal District of Brazil between January and March 2015. A questionnaire containing 20 sociodemographic questions and 50 five-point Likert items was administered. The average scores of each group and each hospital were analyzed. Nurses obtained the highest scores for the use of evidence-based practices (57.8 ± 12.9), while doctors achieved the highest scores for the work process dimension (72 ± 8.5). Medical residents obtained the highest scores for organization of labor and childbirth care (56.5 ± 8.5). No statistically significant differences were found between groups. Hospital scores ranged from 55 to 64. No statistically significant differences were found between hospitals. Most professionals encourage natural childbirth. It is necessary to strengthen actions to promote greater adherence to best care practices, both in relation to organization of labor and childbirth care and to the attitudes and values of health professionals.
