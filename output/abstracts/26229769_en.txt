to assess the surgical technique using the modified palm open technique for the treatment of severe contractions of Dupuytren's disease. over a period of four years, 16 patients underwent surgical treatment, and in its entirety belonged to stages III and IV of the classification proposed by Tubiana et al. We performed measurements of the extension deficit of the metacarpophalangeal joints, proximal and distal interphalangeal in preoperative, postoperative (3 months) and late postoperative period (5-8 years). Angles greater than 30° metacarpophalangeal joints and 15° proximal interphalangeal the results were considered surgical recurrence. there was obtained an average of 6.3° at the metacarpophalangeal joint, 13.8° in the proximal interphalangeal and distal interphalangeal at 1.9°. the modified open palm technique is an effective method in the surgical treatment of severe contractures in Dupuytren's disease.
