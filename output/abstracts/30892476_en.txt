To correlate short-term (duration of mechanical ventilation and length of intensive care unit stay) and long-term (functional capacity) clinical outcomes of patients who reached nutritional adequacy ≥ 70% of predicted in the first 72 hours of hospitalization in the intensive care unit. This was a prospective observational pilot study conducted in an 18-bed intensive care unit. A total of 100 mechanically ventilated patients receiving exclusive enteral nutritional support and receiving intensive care for more than 72 hours were included. Patients who never received enteral nutrition, those with spinal cord trauma, pregnant women, organ donors and cases of family refusal were excluded. The variables studied were nutritional adequacy ≥ 70% of predicted in the first 72 hours of hospitalization, length of intensive care unit stay, duration of mechanical ventilation and the ability to perform activities of daily living after 12 months, assessed via telephone contact using the Lawton Activities of Daily Living Scale. The mean duration of mechanical ventilation was 18 ± 9 days, and the mean intensive care unit length of stay was 19 ± 8 days. Only 45% of the patients received more than 70% of the target nutrition in 72 hours. There was no association between nutritional adequacy and short-term (duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay in the intensive care unit and mortality) or long-term (functional capacity and mortality) clinical outcomes. Critically ill patients receiving caloric intake ≥ 70% in the first 72 hours of hospitalization did not present better outcomes in the short term or after 1 year.
