To retrospectively evaluate the preliminary postoperative results of modified Dega-type acetabular osteotomy to treat developmental dysplasia of the hip, confirming the efficacy and reproducibility of this technique. This retrospective study included patients older than 18 months. A total of 19 hips underwent modified Dega osteotomy. Satisfactory results were obtained, with an average decrease of the acetabular index from 39.2 to 20.6 degrees. The final average center edge angle was 29.6 degrees. Hip joint congruence was reestablished in all cases, and as of this writing, only one case developed necrosis in the femoral head during follow-up. Modified Dega osteotomy demonstrated good initial results, as well as the potential for use in treating developmental dysplasia of the hip. <b>Level of Evidence IV; Case series.</b>
