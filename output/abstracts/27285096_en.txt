Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma can be cured in 60% - 70% of patients. Autologous stem cell transplantation is the standard treatment for relapsed disease. This high-intensity treatment after first complete remission in patients with high International Prognostic Index remains controversial and was performed in our department during some years. Retrospective study, review of clinical records. This study evaluates the outcome of 113 patients transplanted between 1992 and 2012. Considering status before transplantation patients were divided in groups: a) first complete remission after 1 line of chemotherapy (n = 64); b) first complete remission after ≥ two chemotherapy lines (n = 15); c) second complete remission (n = 15); d) more advanced diseased (n = 19). Chemotherapy used in first line therapy was mainly R-CHOP (n = 71) and CHOP (n = 28). The median follow-up of patients still alive was 34 months (1 - 221). At five years, overall survival was 73% (± 5) and disease free survival was 75% (± 5). Conventional chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplant is a safe and efficient option for selected patients. In our series 70% high-risk patients were free from disease with this strategy.
