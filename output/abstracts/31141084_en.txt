To evaluate the satisfaction of patients admitted to the intensive care unit using a diary and analyze possible points for improving this instrument. This was an observational, retrospective study, conducted between March 2014 and July 2017, in a multidisciplinary intensive care unit of a district hospital. The diary was implemented in patients sedated for 3 or more days. Three months after discharge, their satisfaction was assessed using a questionnaire. A patient who agreed with the 5 statements assessing the diary's help in clarifying the intensive care unit stay, in filling memory gaps, in recovery, in reassurance, and in the recommendation of this intervention was defined as satisfied. A total of 110 patients were included, of whom 55 answered the questionnaire. Of these, 36 (65.5%) were classified as satisfied. Each item had a positive response in more than 74% of cases. A total of 60% of the participants suggested increasing the number of photographs. No significant differences were found in the subgroup analysis (age, sex, duration of sedation and ventilation, length of diary keeping, severity on admission, or delirium, depression, or anxiety in the intensive care unit). Most patients were satisfied with the diary but suggested an increase in the number of photographs.
