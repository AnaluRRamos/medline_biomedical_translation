To evaluate the results from surgical treatment of the terrible triad of the elbow, with a minimum of six months of follow-up, taking elbow function into consideration. The analyzed aspects of 20 patients, who underwent surgical treatment of the terrible triad of the elbow, were given as follows: Dash score (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand), Meps (Mayo Elbow Performance Score), pain according to VAS (visual analog scale), ROM (range of motion), patient satisfaction, degree of energy of the trauma, complications and radiographs. The mean length of follow-up among the patients was 38 months. There were statistically significant relationships between the following set of parameters: trauma mechanism and patient satisfaction; radiological outcome of 'heterotopic ossification' and satisfaction; functional flexion-extension ROM and satisfaction; and between type of radial head fracture and presence of a radiological outcome. The surgical treatment for the terrible triad of the elbow generally provided satisfactory results, when the functioning of this joint upon the return to activities was taken into consideration.
