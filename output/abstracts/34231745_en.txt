The scope of this study is to evaluate factors related to family dysfunction (FD) among 227 randomly selected nonagenarians and centenarians in Porto Alegre, State of Rio Grande do Sul, who were visited and assessed in their homes. FD was evaluated by the 'Family APGAR score,' being considered with FD from 0 to 6, and without FD from 7 to 10 in this study. Sociodemographic and economic data, physical functionality, health self-perception, comorbidities, depressive symptoms, cognitive function, social support and interaction were evaluated. The mean APGAR score was 9.05Â±1.81, and FD occurred in 9.69% of the participants. Among the health conditions, the self-perception of health (p=0.0003), the number of depressive symptoms (p<0.0001), receiving visits (p=0.0994), having recourse to help in case of illness (p=0.0090), and the need for help to administer medication (p=0.0602), were significantly related to FD. In the adjusted analysis, self-perception of health, the presence of depressive symptoms and the need for help in administering medication were associated with FD among nonagenarians and centenarians. These factors may influence the satisfaction of nonagenarians and centenarians with their family relationships.
