The study presented in this paper aimed at understanding how anorexic young women use virtual environments as spaces of sociability in order to construct a narrative about anorexia, anchor their experiences through emotional mutuality and validate discourses. To do so, an analysis of the content found in the commenting and posting sections of pro-anorexia blogs was carried out. Three thematic categories were identified: body, personal identity and sociability on the web. It was observed that blogs are virtual spaces of sociability and construction of identity groups. The representations and the experiences lived by the corporal materiality feed cyberspace and are the starting point for understanding a phenomenon particular to the contemporaneity, that is the virtual exchanges. In blogs, one can find body narratives that seek to give coherence to an individual and to his or her existence as well as narratives that aim at anchoring and legitimizing personal experiences and validating pro-anorexia attitudes. Social ties are strengthened within the group, which becomes an emotional community. The meanings of the spreading discourses allow us to infer that in these groups, the materiality of anorexic bodies emancipates itself from the social stigmas of a disease.
