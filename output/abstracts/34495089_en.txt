The study analyzes interactions between drug treatment adherence, blood pressure targets, and depression in a probabilistic sample of hypertensive individuals treated in the Family Health Strategy in Governador Valadares, Minas Gerais State, Brazil. This is a cross-sectional study with 641 hypertensive individuals 40 years or older, residing in the urban area of Governador Valadares. Structured scripts were used to collect data in home interviews, with a focus on the following indicators: Medication Assessment Questionnaire (MAQ), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and blood pressure measurement. Due to the simultaneity of the target events (depression, blood pressure target, and adherence), we applied a system of recursive and simultaneous nonlinear equations. The results suggest that the odds of meeting the blood pressure target increase significantly with adherence to treatment; they also suggest that individuals that meet the blood pressure target show 2.6 higher odds of treatment adherence. Adherence has a protective effect against depression: individuals with minimal adherence show 8.4 higher odds of developing depressive symptoms when compared to those with maximum adherence. Drug treatment adherence is related simultaneously to blood pressure control and lower levels of depression. Promoting drug treatment adherence is essential for ensuring that individuals remain normotensive, with the potential for reducing levels of depression. These positive externalities can reduce pressure on the health system, with simultaneous gains in quality of life for hypertensive individuals.
