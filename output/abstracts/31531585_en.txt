The objective of this article is to question the ways in which Apple Watch applications require users to manage their body and health.

The results indicate that wearable technologies became 'prosthetics' capturing information in real time, acting as a 'confession mechanism' for governing and normalizing the body, and are managed by the market as biocapital.
