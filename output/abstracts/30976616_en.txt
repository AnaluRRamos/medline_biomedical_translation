Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) have reportedly been used in inappropriate clinical settings, often leading to an increased risk of adverse effects, drug interactions, and costs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the adequacy of PPI prescription in an internal medicine ward. The discharged home inpatients of a segment in the medicine department of a central hospital in the first trimester of 2017 were evaluated; those who died or were transferred to another unit were excluded. Data on gender, age, admission, and discharge therapy and diagnoses which could support PPI use were collected from clinical records. Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel 2013® and IBM SPSS Statistics 20®. A total of 318 hospitalizations were included, corresponding to 301 patients; 171 (56.8%) were female and the average age was 75.4 ± 14.6 years. Among the 318 hospitalizations, 148 patients (46.5%) were on PPI at admission and 175 (55%) at discharge, the majority of them without indication (<i>n</i> = 91, 61.5% vs. <i>n</i> = 109, 62.3%). The main inappropriate indication was anticoagulation alone (<i>n</i> = 33, 36.3% vs. <i>n</i> = 43, 39.4%). There was indication for PPI therapy in 93 (29.2%) of the cases at admission and 111 (34.9%) at discharge, mostly for prophylaxis of gastrointestinal bleeding in high-risk patients (<i>n</i> = 82, 88.2% vs. <i>n</i> = 96, 86.5%). Among those with indication, 57 (61.3%) were medicated at admission versus 66 (59%) at discharge. The association between PPI therapy and an indication for its prescription was lost by the time of discharge (<i>p</i> = 0.245). PPI prescription is not in agreement with existing recommendations, which is why it should be revised at hospital discharge. The primary indication for PPI therapy is the prophylaxis of gastrointestinal bleeding in high-risk patients and the main inappropriate indication is prophylaxis in low-risk patients. A large proportion of the patients indicated for PPI use were discharged without prescription.
