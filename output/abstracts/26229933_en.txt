To determine the ideal angle for making the distal femoral cut in total knee arthroplasty in a Brazilian population. Panoramic radiographs of the lower limbs bearing weight from 79 patients (57 women and 22 men) were studied, totaling 107 knees with an indication for total knee arthroplasty. The femoral anatomical axis, femoral mechanical axis and cervical-diaphyseal angle were traced out. The angle of the femoral cut was determined from the meeting point between the femoral anatomical and mechanical axes. The ideal degree of femoral valgus was compared between men and women and between knees presenting varus and valgus alignment of the lower limb. The ideal distal femoral cut was also correlated with the cervical-diaphyseal angle. The ideal femoral valgus angle ranged from 4.2 to 8.6 degrees, with a mean of 6.3 degrees. There was no statistically significant difference in the distal femoral cut between patients with coronal varus and valgus alignment (p = 0.180). Comparing men and women, there was no statistically significant difference regarding the ideal femoral valgus between the groups (p = 0.057). The cervical-diaphyseal angle presented an inverse relationship with the distal femoral cut. The mean angle between the femoral mechanical and anatomical axes was 6.3 degree. Neither preoperative coronal alignment nor sex had any influence on the distal femoral cut. The cervical-diaphyseal angle presented an inverse relationship with the distal femoral cut.
