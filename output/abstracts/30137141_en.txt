This study aimed to analyze the neuropsychomotor performance of children by implementing the Denver Developmental Screening Test-II (DDST-II). We evaluated a sample of 318 children aged 36 to 48 months. Results indicated that girls performed better in three of the four areas analyzed in the test: Personal-Social (p < 0.001), Fine Motor-adaptive (p = 0.020) and Language (p = 0.028). No significant difference was observed between genders in the Gross Motor skills area. Analyzing the performance of children in implementing the tasks expected in the test, we found significant differences in the following items: in the Personal-Social area, the worst-performing item was 'Brushes teeth without help'; in the Fine Motor area, the worst-performing item was 'shows the longest line'; in the Language area, the worst-performing items were 'Knows two adjectives', 'Knows four actions' and 'Understands four prepositions'; and in the Gross Motor area, the worst-performing item was 'Hops on one foot'. The results suggest that socially-imposed standards, based on gender differences, may interfere with the neuropsychomotor behavior of children. Furthermore, knowing such development profile is crucial in the formulation of public policies and actions that can contribute to child development.
