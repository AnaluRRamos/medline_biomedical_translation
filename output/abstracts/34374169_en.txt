Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) is a new generation medical therapeutic option for bacterial infections. CAP causes physical cell wall rupture and DNA damage, therefore making it highly useful in the treatment of various conditions such as skin infections. The antimicrobial activity of cold atmospheric microwave plasma (CAMP) against major strains in canine skin infections was tested and the difference in antimicrobial activity between the antibiotic-resistant and antibiotic-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius was evaluated. American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli) and clinical isolates identified as methicillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius (n = 27) and methicillin-susceptible S. pseudintermedius (n = 13) were exposed to CAMP for 10 s, 30 s and 60 s. Afterwards, the bacterial survival rate was confirmed. Gram-negative bacteria (P. aeruginosa and E. coli) were more susceptible than Gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus and S. pseudintermedius) for the same duration of CAMP exposure. Only the Gram-negative bacteria were completely killed after 60 s exposure. In S. pseudintermedius isolates, CAMP exposure had similar antibacterial effects regardless of antibiotic resistance. CAMP has sufficient antimicrobial activity against major bacterial strains that cause pyoderma and otitis externa in dogs, and may be an alternative therapeutic option for S. pseudintermedius skin infections, for which antibiotics often are ineffective because of antimicrobial resistance in clinical veterinary medicine.
