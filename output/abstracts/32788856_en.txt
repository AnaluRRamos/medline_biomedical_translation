Brachial plexus injury can lead to significant functional deficit for the patient. Elbow flexion restoration is a priority in surgical treatment. Free functional muscle transfer is an option for early or late treatment failure. This study evaluated patient characteristics and elbow flexion muscle strength after gracilis functioning muscle transfer. Medical records of 95 patients operated from 2003 to 2019 were analyzed and the following variables recorded: age, gender, nerve transfer used to motorize the gracilis muscle, time between trauma and surgery, age at surgery and elbow flexion strength after a minimum of 12 months following functioning muscle transfer. 87 patients were included, averaging 30 years of age (17 to 57 years). Fifty-five achieved elbow flexion muscle strength â‰¥ M3 (55/87, 65%), with a mean follow-up of 37 months. The nerves used for activation of the transferred gracilis were: 45 spinal accessory, 10 intercostal, 8 median n. fascicles, 22 ulnar n. fascicles and 2 phrenic nerves. Functional muscle transfer is a viable surgical procedure for elbow flexion in chronic traumatic brachial plexus injuries in adults. <b>Level of Evidence II, Retrospective study.</b>
