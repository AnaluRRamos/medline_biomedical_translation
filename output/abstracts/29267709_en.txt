Health promotion has a set of strategies for advancing health and reducing inequalities. However, evaluating the effectiveness of health promotion programs has been a challenge. This paper shows the development and application of the Evaluation Matrix, constructed with qualitative-quantitative and multidimensional indicators supported by public policies targeting socially vulnerable territories. This is a cross-sectional study with the implementation of a health promotion program in order to develop an Evaluation Matrix to be applied in two distinct socio-environmentally vulnerable areas. The Evaluation Matrix proved to be easily applicable and enabled the detection of strengths and weaknesses of health promotion programs applied in different territories. The participation of managers, teams, population and multiple sectors of society was decisive for the success of the program. Furthermore, community health workers stood out as essential stakeholders due to their linkages with the population. Contributions include a tool and methodology for evaluating health promotion programs to be applied in different territories and modified according to the territory.
