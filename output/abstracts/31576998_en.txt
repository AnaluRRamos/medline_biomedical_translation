There are currently between six and eight thousand illnesses classified as rare diseases, 80% of which are of genetic origin and among the studies those of a quantitative and biomedical nature stand out. The objective of this study was to identify and describe the characteristics of scientific studies in Brazil and worldwide using a qualitative approach on rare genetic diseases published in indexed databases in the area of health and social sciences. The Scielo, Lilacs, Medline, PubMed, BDENF, Web of Science, Scopus and CINAHL databases were researched between 2013-2018 using the key words 'Qualitative Research' and 'Rare Disease.' A total of 171 articles, classified by year, country, language, rare disease type, data collection strategy, knowledge area and theme were selected. The texts reveal the relevance of qualitative studies on rare genetic diseases in their ability to support organization, decision-making and health training in a way that responds to the social and individual needs of the community. It is important, however, to conduct further studies, especially within Brazil, that address rare genetic conditions, revealing the experiences and how they affect the personal, family, professional and organizational interactions in terms of the proper and effective modes of care.
