To evaluate prenatal care in primary health care in the perception of pregnant women. This cross-sectional study analyzes the association and statistical significance of the expectations and satisfaction of pregnant women receiving prenatal care in a municipality of southeast Brazil. We evaluated the association using simple logistic regression and statistical significance between variables and the expectation and satisfaction domains. A predominance of low expectations, with 279 (74%), and high satisfaction, with 220 (58.8%), was identified among the pregnant women regarding their perceptions of prenatal care. Tests showed an association and a statistical significance between the variable 'to have used the same prenatal service' with the satisfaction domain. No differences were found between the two service models for both domains. The low expectation and high satisfaction of the pregnant women for the two care models can reveal ways of improving the quality of care in both services.
