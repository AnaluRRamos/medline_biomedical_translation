The aim of this study was to identify trends in hospitalization for diabetes mellitus and their correlation with the Family Health Strategy (FHS) coverage in the state of Paraná, by Health District (HD), between 2000 and 2012. It is an ecological study based on secondary data from the Hospital Information System of the Brazilian Unified Health System and the Primary Care Department. There was downward trend for general admission rates (from 10.2 to 9.0/10,000 inhabitants), but upward trend for some HDs. No correlation was observed between admission rates and the FHS coverage for the state. However, there was strong inverse correlation for Paranaguá, Metropolitan, Foz do Iguaçu and Umuarama HDs, and strong and direct correlation for Pato Branco, Campo Mourão, Cianorte, Telêmaco Borba and Ivaiporã HDs. Overall, hospitalizations for diabetes mellitus proved to be decreasing and without correlation with FHS coverage; however, there were differences according to HDs.
