To compare lifestyle changes during the COVID-19 pandemic according to the presence or absence of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) in Brazilian adults. Cross-sectional study, using data from the ConVid survey, between April and May 2020. The following variables were evaluated: lifestyle and presence of one or more NCDs (diabetes, hypertension, respiratory disease, heart disease, and cancer). Sociodemographic characteristics were used as adjustment. Relative frequencies and confidence intervals (CI) of 95% of the explanatory variables were calculated before and during the pandemic. For the comparison of groups, with or without NCDs, crude and adjusted (PRadj) prevalence ratios were estimated by Poisson regression. There was a reduction in physical activity (60% in those without NCDs and 58% in those with NCDs) and in vegetable consumption (10.8% in those without NCDs and 12.7% in those with NCDs). On the other hand, there was an increase in the time spent watching television and on screens of computer/tablet (302% and 43.5% in those without NCDs and 196.5% and 30.6% with NCDs, respectively); consumption of frozen meals (43.6% in those without NCDs and 53.7% with NCDs), snacks (42.3% without NCDs and 31.2% with NCDs), and chocolate (14.8% without NCDs). During the pandemic, patients with NCDs were less active (PRadj = 0.77; 95%CI 0.65 - 0.92), had greater habit of watching TV (PRadj = 1.16; 95%CI 1.08 - 1.26), and consumed less vegetables (PRadj = 0.88; 95%CI 0.81 - 0.96). It was evident that adults with NCDs had their lifestyles more altered during the COVID-19 pandemic.
