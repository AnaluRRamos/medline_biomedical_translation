Retrospective case-control study of authors experience in the modified Bristow-Latarjet procedure for treatment of recurrent traumatic anterior glenohumeral dislocation with glenoid bone injury. Sample with 102 recurrent glenohumeral dislocation cases submitted to modified Bristow-Latarjet procedure. Indications included situations of recurrent traumatic anterior glenohumeral instability with more than two dislocation episodes and with glenoid bone attritional or fragmentary injuries, without possibility of reconstruction. Mean follow-up time was 5.33 ± 2.74 years (minimum 1; range 1-13). The mean Walch-Duplay Score at the last evaluation was 91.23 ± 11.46 (range 15-100). The functional score of patients with glenoid bone loss greater than 20% did not show a significant difference in comparison with patients with glenoid bone loss lower than 20% (90 <i>vs.</i> 92, respectively). The functional score also did not show a significant difference between sports practice categories and between recreational and competitive practice, being excellent (greater than 90) in every category. There were no dislocation recurrences and the only complications were a case of persistent instability and a screw revision. Mild glenohumeral osteoarthrosis imaging signs were identified in 7.84% of the patients; however, their functional scores were not significantly different in comparison to other patients. The modified Bristow-Latarjet procedure is a very effective procedure with few complications in the medium-term, showing very satisfactory functional outcomes in the treatment of recurrent traumatic anterior glenohumeral dislocation associated with glenoid bone injury.
