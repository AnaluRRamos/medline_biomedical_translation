To evaluate the current evidence that support or disprove the use of glucosamine and chondroitin in the treatment of patients with osteoarthritis. We performed a literature review using the databases of Medline, PubMed and the Cochrane Controlled Trial Register and Cochrane Databases Systematic Reviews (Cochrane Library). We considered only studies with high level of evidence. The study included analysis of randomized controlled trials that included at least 100 patients in each intervention group, meta-analyzes and systematic reviews. Seven meta-analysis, one systematic review and five randomized clinical trials fit inclusion criteria of this review. Considering the best evidences until now, the use of glucosamine and chondroitin does not provide clinical relevant benefits to patients with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip (Level I of evidence and grade A of recommendation). Further trials with adequate technology are necessaries to elucidate this question.
