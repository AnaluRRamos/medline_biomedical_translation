The aim of this consensus statement on viscosupplementation is to serve as a reference document based on relevant literature and clinical experience in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis using an intra-articular injection of hyaluronic acid, covering key aspects such as clinical indications, effectiveness, and tolerability. A multidisciplinary panel including two sports medicine physicians, six orthopedists, four physiatrists, and two rheumatologists were selected based on their clinical and academic experience of viscosupplementation. Sixteen statements were prepared and discussed, after which a vote was held. Each member of the panel gave a score between 0 and 10 on a Likert scale, specifying their level of agreement with the statement. The panel reached a consensus on several issues. Specifically, the panel agreed that the best indication is for mild to moderate knee arthrosis; prior or concomitant use of intraarticular triamcinolone hexacetonide may optimize the effect of hyaluronic acid; viscosupplementation should not be performed as an isolated procedure but in conjunction with other rehabilitative and pharmacological measures; viscosupplementation has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and chondroprotective effects; and viscosupplementation is cost-effective. This consensus statement provides clear information and guidance for both individuals and payers. <i>Level of evidence V, Consensus statement.</i>
