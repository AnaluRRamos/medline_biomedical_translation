Dengue virus is an endemic now ravaging the MERCOSUR region. The objective of this research is to assess the epidemiological situation caused by dengue in the MERCOSUR Member States and Associate States. Statistical data were used (estimated dengue morbidity rates for the period 1980-2015, with particular focus on 1991-2015), together with a corpus of health legislation, commercial law, arbitration awards, executive reports, and subject-specific literature. It was found that, with the exception of Chile and Uruguay, MERCOSUR members and associate countries (in particular, Brazil, which has the highest incidence of dengue cases in the world) need to identify the factors that favor the increasing spread of this endemic disease. This brief overview of the MERCOSUR Member States in the period 1991-2015 is based on a consideration of macrostructural data that represent the sum of the four elements established by WHO and PAHO for dengue control: the political will of governments, intersectoral coordination, community participation, and the strengthening of national health legislation.
