The purpose of the present study was to prospectively quantify the normal limits of brain perfusion using specific software in a group of asymptomatic young volunteers submitted to single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) with <sup>99m</sup>Tc-ethyl cysteinate dimer (<sup>99m</sup>Tc-ECD). We used 15 MBq/kg of intravenous <sup>99m</sup>Tc-ECD in 30 healthy volunteers submitted to brief neuropsychological tests and a clinical questionnaire. These data were normalized relative to the cerebellum (Group 1) and to the brain cortex (Group 2). Statistical analysis was performed with Student's t-test. The average radioactivity was 6.5 million counts/study. The normalized (Group I) revealed an average value of 78.03%, with standard deviation (SD) of 4.07. Two volunteers in this group had slightly greater than two standard deviations from the mean. When we used (Group II), the average value was 71.01%, with a SD of 4.66. We observed a difference between groups of 9% (P<0.001). The present study suggests normal cortical perfusional values for a group of young asymptomatic volunteers, utilizing <sup>99m</sup>Tc-ECD. This allows further quantification of neuro-SPECT data, specifically comparisons across patient populations. Furthermore, this method represents a new tool that can be used to further explore the field of neuroimaging, particularly neuropsychiatry.
