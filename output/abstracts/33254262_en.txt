To evaluate the prevalence of hypertensive disorders, perinatal outcomes (preterm infants, low birthweight infants and Apgar score < 7 at the 5th minute and fetal deaths) and the cesarean rates in pregnant women hospitalized for delivery at the Maternidade Hilda Brandão da Santa Casa de Belo Horizonte, Belo Horizonte, state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, from March 1, 2008 to February 28, 2018.  A case-control study was performed, and the groups selected for comparison were those of pregnant women with and without hypertensive disorders. Out of the 36,724 women, 4,464 were diagnosed with hypertensive disorders and 32,260 did not present hypertensive disorders RESULTS:  The prevalence of hypertensive disorders was 12.16%; the perinatal outcomes and cesarean rates between the 2 groups with and without hypertensive disorders were: preterm infants (21.70% versus 9.66%, odds ratio [OR] 2.59, 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.40-2.80, <i>p</i> < 0.001); low birthweight infants (24.48% versus 10.56%; OR 2.75; 95% CI, 2.55-2.96; <i>p</i> < 0.001); Apgar score < 7 at the 5<sup>th</sup> minute (1.40% versus 1.10%; OR 1.27; 95% CI, 0.97-1.67; <i>p</i> = 0.84); dead fetuses diagnosed prior to delivery (1.90% versus 0.91%; OR 2.12; 95% CI, 1.67-2.70; <i>p</i> < 0.001); cesarean rates (60.22% versus 31.21%; OR 3.34; 95% CI, 3.14-3.55; <i>p</i> < 0.001).  Hypertensive disorders are associated with higher rates of cesarean deliveries and higher risk of preterm infants, low birthweight infants and a higher risk of fetal deaths.
