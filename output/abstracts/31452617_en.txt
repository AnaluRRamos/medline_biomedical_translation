Anterolateral approaches for proximal humerus osteosynthesis have great advantages because they allow direct exposure of the lateral aspect of the humerus without the muscular retraction seen in the deltopectoral approach. However, much resistance is found among surgeons due to the potential risk of iatrogenic injury to the axillary nerve. To identify the incidence of axillary nerve iatrogenic lesions and evaluate the functional results of proximal humerus osteosynthesis with locking plates using anterolateral approaches. The literature review followed the PRISMA protocol. A total of 23 articles were selected from 786 patients submitted to anterolateral approaches. Three cases (0.38%) of iatrogenic axillary nerve lesions were confirmed. The results of the functional tests were similar to those of the deltopectoral approach. Anterolateral approaches are a viable and safe alternative for proximal humerus osteosynthesis with locking plate. Subacromial impingement was the most frequent complication. <b><i>Level of Evidence II, Systematic Review.</i></b>
