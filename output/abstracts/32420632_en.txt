To investigate whether activity-monitors and machine learning models could provide accurate information about physical activity performed by children and adolescents with cerebral palsy (CP) who use mobility aids for ambulation. Eleven participants (mean age 11y [SD 3y]; six females, five males) classified in Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) levels III and IV, completed six physical activity trials wearing a tri-axial accelerometer on the wrist, hip, and thigh. Trials included supine rest, upper-limb task, walking, wheelchair propulsion, and cycling. Three supervised learning algorithms (decision tree, support vector machine [SVM], random forest) were trained on features in the raw-acceleration signal. Model-performance was evaluated using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation accuracy. Cross-validation accuracy for the single-placement models ranged from 59% to 79%, with the best performance achieved by the random forest wrist model (79%). Combining features from two or more accelerometer placements significantly improved classification accuracy. The random forest wrist and hip model achieved an overall accuracy of 92%, while the SVM wrist, hip, and thigh model achieved an overall accuracy of 90%. Models trained on features in the raw-acceleration signal may provide accurate recognition of clinically relevant physical activity behaviours in children and adolescents with CP who use mobility aids for ambulation in a controlled setting. Machine learning may assist clinicians in evaluating the efficacy of surgical and therapy-based interventions. Machine learning may help researchers better understand the short- and long-term benefits of physical activity for children with more severe motor impairments.
