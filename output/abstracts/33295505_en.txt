This paper addresses Worker's Health scientific production, specifically about how the Journal Ciência & Saúde Coletiva has contributed to the consolidation of this field. This is a qualitative and descriptive study based on a review of the Journal's collection from 1996 to 2019. We selected a final sample of 156 texts organized by thematic groups. The theme was designed with the predominance of Epidemiological and Public Policy studies, studies of a theoretical-methodological nature and related to World of Work Transformations. Approximately 60% of publications are concentrated in the 2009-2015 period. A significant decline in the number of works was observed as of 2016. The papers address Worker's Health in a comprehensive and diversified manner. There is a greater emphasis on research on work and environment, health issues, formulation and implementation of policies and programs. The journal significantly contributes to the national Worker's Health. Strengthening academic production in this field remains a challenge, especially in the face of the loss of rights.
