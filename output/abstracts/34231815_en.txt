COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. The clinical presentation is predominantly respiratory symptoms; however, in the current literature, several neurological manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection have been described. The authors present the clinical case of a 45-year-old man hospitalized for pneumonia with a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2, without a neurological history, who, on the sixteenth day of hospitalization, presented a sudden change in his state of consciousness accompanied by conjugated right gaze deviation and myoclonus of the face and thoracic region to the left, followed by generalized tonic-clonic seizures associated with persistent left hemiparesis. The present study highlights a positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 in cerebrospinal fluid. The patient progressed with gradual improvement, and the outcome was favorable.
