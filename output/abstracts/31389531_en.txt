This study aims to analyze the factors associated with aggression perpetrated by unknown assailants among young males treated by the emergency services. It is a case-control study with data from the Violence and Accident Surveillance System conducted in 2014 by 86 emergency services located in Brazilian State capitals. Young males between 15 and 29 years of age were included. All victims of assault perpetrated by unknown assailants were included as cases. Controls were randomly selected among those who had suffered accidental injuries in the ratio of 2:1. Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR), and 787 cases and 1,574 controls were included. Risk factors according to the adjusted analysis were: lack of paid work (OR 2.09; 95% CI; 1.66; 2.64), alcohol consumption (OR 3.14; 95% CI; 2.36; 4.17), occurrence at night (OR 3.39; 95% CI; 2.50; 4.61) or early morning (OR 5.31; 95% CI; 3.63; 7.75). Higher age (25-29 years) and schooling (5-8 years of study) were factors of protection. The results revealed the need for more effective and multisectoral actions to prevent violence among young males, which consider the factors associated with such aggression, including alcohol consumption, and investments in qualified education and paid employment.
