This study is an evaluation of infant death research in Recife, Pernambuco (PE). It is a cross-sectional study with 120 variables grouped into six dimensions (prenatal, birth, child care, family characteristics, occurrence of death, and conclusion and recommendations), weighted by consensus technique. The research was classifiedas adequate, partially adequate or inadequate according to a composite indicator assessment (ICA). There was dissension on 11 variables (9 in prenatal dimension, one in labor and birth, and 1 in the conclusions and recommendations). Of the 568 deaths studied, 56.2% have adequate research. The occurrence of death was the best-evaluated dimension and prenatal the poorest. The preparation of the ICA enables professionals and managers of child health policies to identify bottlenecks in the investigation of infant deaths for better targeting of actions, and contributing to the discussion about surveillance in other cities and states.
