The objective of the study is to construct a conceptual framework for monitoring progress on policies and actions aimed at reaching universal health.Conceptual models and proposed methodologies for monitoring universal health coverage and access were reviewed. A literature review was also done to select relevant indicators. This review was supplemented with a process of consultation with health systems experts from the Region of the Americas.A comprehensive framework was developed for monitoring policies and actions for universal health coverage and access. This monitoring framework contains four components (strategic actions, outputs, outcomes, and impacts) and identifies a set of policy options to guide the transformation of health systems toward universal access to health and universal health coverage. Sixty-four out of 500 indicators were chosen for evaluation of the monitoring framework components. The proposed approach for use of the framework is based on measuring inequities in access and coverage, and on collecting qualitative evidence on the degree to which policies and actions have been implemented.The proposed framework could help strengthen health system in processes of transformation toward universal access to health and universal health coverage.
