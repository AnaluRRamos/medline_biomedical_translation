The Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN) enables knowledge of the profile of people with active tuberculosis (TB) in a country of continental dimensions such as Brazil. Available in all Brazilian municipalities and states, the system enables continuous consolidation of data, evaluation and monitoring of actions related to TB control in the country. The purpose of this paper is to present the specificities of SINAN-Net related to TB, including the follow-up screen, the record linkage and the follow-up report. Additionally, we describe the main variables and indicators and the challenges and limitations of the system.
