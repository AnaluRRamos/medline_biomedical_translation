Tremor is the commonest involuntary movement. The differential diagnosis is wide, and can be challenging even for experienced neurologists. Nonetheless, many tremors have a benign etiology and clinical course and, in many cases, non-neurologists are able to clinically manage these situations. This manuscript approaches the different types of tremor, their diagnosis, main differential diagnoses, the desired clinical approach, and therapeutic options of the most important conditions in clinical practice.
