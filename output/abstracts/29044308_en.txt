Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a rare systemic inflammatory disorder characterized by vasculitis of the small arteries, the arterioles and the capillaries together with necrotizing granulomatous lesions. This case reports on a young female patient, previously diagnosed with granulomatosis with polyangiitis, who was admitted to the intensive care unit with seizures and hemodynamic instability due to a complete atrioventricular heart block. The event was associated with multiple episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia without any structural heart changes or electrolyte disturbances. In the intensive care unit, the patient was fitted with a provisory pacemaker, followed by immunosuppression with corticosteroids and immunobiological therapy, resulting in a total hemodynamic improvement. Severe conduction disorders in patients presenting granulomatosis with polyangiitis are rare but can contribute to increased morbidity. Early detection and specific intervention can prevent unfavorable outcomes, specifically in the intensive care unit.
