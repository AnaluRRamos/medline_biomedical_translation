This study evaluated the epidemiological profile of patients with suspected physical abuse, especially regarding the occurrence of fractures, treated in a referral hospital. The authors reviewed all reports of suspected abuse against children and adolescents (AACA) in this hospital from January 2005 to December 2015. They were assessed and separated by month and year. The characteristics of the victims of physical abuse with occurrence of fractures were studied. The features of the fractures were evaluated in those patients with available radiographs. Of the 3125 notifications, 500 were classified as physical injuries; of these, 63 had fractures. An annual progressive increase in notifications was observed. As for age group, 50 patients (80.6%) were up to three years old and 36 (58%) up to one year. Most were male (60%) and the likely aggressors were mother alone and both parents (27.5% each). In 30 patients with available images, fractures of long bones (femur, tibia, and humerus) predominated (71%), as well as a single fracture line (74%), diaphyseal location (73%), and a transverse line (57%). There were two deaths in fracture cases (3%). All orthopedists should be alert to suspected AACA in children with trauma below the age of three, even without classic signs of abuse.
