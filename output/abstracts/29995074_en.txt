To identify vulnerabilities and the association between religiosity and depressive signs in the elderly hospitalised in an emergency unit. This cross-sectional study was conducted with 140 elderly patients admitted to a public hospital in the Federal District, Brazil, between May and October 2016. Data were collected using a semi-structured health questionnaire, the Duke University Religion Scale (DUREL), and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). The elderly patients were vulnerable in terms of schooling, place of residence, and life habits, and 37.3% exhibited signs of depression. A weak association was found between religiosity and the development of depressive signs (p â‰¤ 0, R = 0.12; p = 0.02 and r = 0.06). The results showed isolated religiosity is not an effective protective factor, but it strengthens resilience in the face of disease and serves as a support network for the elderly.
