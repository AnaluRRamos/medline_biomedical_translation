To assess and compare radiographic, tomographic and functional pre and postoperative parameters of patients submitted to treatment of nonunion of the scaphoid waist with locked plate for scaphoid. This is a case series of scaphoid waist nonunion, operated from March 2017 to March 2018 at the Institute of Orthopedics and Traumatology of HCFMUSP, using the technique of Fisk-Fernandez and osteosynthesis with locked plate for scaphoid APTUSÂ®Hand from Medartis. The patients were submitted to radiographs, computed tomography and functional evaluation by the occupational therapy team in the pre and postoperative periods. There was consolidation of the scaphoid waist nonunion in all cases, improvement in the parameters of carpal alignment in the imaging examinations, but functionally we observed reduction of the range of motion and grip strength in relation to the contralateral limb. The treatment of the scaphoid waist nonunion with locked plate was effective, with a high index of consolidation and improvement of the carpal alignment in the imaging tests, although with a reduction in the range of motion and grip strength in relation to the contralateral limb when evaluated with 12 weeks postoperatively. <b><i>Level of Evidence IV, Case series.</i></b>
