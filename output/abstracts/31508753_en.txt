The Nutritional Risk Screening (NRS-2002) is a gold standard tool in nutritional risk analysis. Thus, the present study aimed to identify which one or which of the criteria evaluated in the NRS-2002 most contribute to determine the nutritional risk. This is a descriptive, cross-sectional and quantitative study with 763 adults and elderly people hospitalized in the year 2015. We applied the NRS-2002, which evaluates the variables Body Mass Index (BMI), weight loss in the last 3 months, reduction of food intake in the last week and severity of the disease. The data statistics was descriptive and analytical, using the univariate logistic regression method. It was observed that 46.4% of the patients presented nutritional risk and that men and the elderly had greater chance of risk. Weight loss was the most prevalent criterion, followed by reduced food intake; BMI < 20.5kg/m² had a greater effect on nutritional risk (OR = 31.0, 95% CI: 14.21;67.44). In conclusion, BMI < 20.5kg/m² and weight loss in the last three months are the factors that contributed the most in determining nutritional risk, and early identification of nutritional risk is extremely important for guiding dietary management to improvement of food intake with the objective of recovering body weight.
