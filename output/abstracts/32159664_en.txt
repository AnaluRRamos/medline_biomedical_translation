This study aimed to identify associated factors with drivers' involvement in traffic accidents (TA). Thus, in 2013, a household survey was conducted with 1,406 drivers in Jequi√©, Bahia, Brazil. A hierarchical conceptual model was established and consisted of four blocks of exposure factors, considering the proximal-distal relationships between them and the outcome. Multilevel logistic regression was applied to estimate the Odds Ratio (OR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (95%CI). Higher TA probability was observed among drivers aged 15-29 years (OR=3.15; 95%CI 1.24-8.02), with black or brown skin color (OR=1.56; 95%CI 1.03-2.35), motorcyclists (OR=1.73; 95%CI 1.15-2.60), with a history of traffic tickets (OR=1.75; 95%CI 1.04-2.94), who reported drinking and driving (OR=1.68; 95%CI 1.12-2.53) and used cell phone while driving (OR=1.63; 95%CI 1.09-2.43). Proximal factors changed the exposure association measures concerning higher levels of determination of the hierarchical model, mainly regarding the gender variable. The results emphasize the behavioral factors and reaffirm the TAs' preventable potential due to the occurrence of avoidable conditions associated with the outcome.
