Endoscopic full-thickness resection (EFTR) is an emerging technique for the treatment of various conditions for which classic endoscopic resection techniques have failed or were considered to be at high risk for perforation. The full-thickness resection device (FTRD) is an over-the-scope system which allows a single-step EFTR. The aim of our study is to describe our experience in EFTR of colorectal lesions using the FTRD. Nine patients (10 colorectal lesions) were proposed for EFTR. Safety, R0 resection and endoscopic treatment success were evaluated. Reasons for referral included nonlifting adenomas (<i>n</i> = 4), nonlifting adenoma recurrence (<i>n</i> = 5), and submucosal lesion (<i>n</i> = 1). EFTR was technically successful in all patients. The mean duration of the procedure was 55 min. R0 resection was obtained in all patients. No major complications were detected. All lesions were successfully treated by the endoscopic technique and no patient was referred for surgery. In patients with available follow-up (<i>n</i> = 6), no recurrence was detected. EFTR is a feasible, reasonable time-consuming, safe, and promising endoscopic resection technique. FTRD is an additional tool for difficult-to-treat colorectal lesions.
