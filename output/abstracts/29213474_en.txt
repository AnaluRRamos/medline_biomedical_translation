Cognitive and psychiatric dysfunction has been described in several neurodegenerative diseases but has not been systematically evaluated in spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10). The aim of the present study was to investigate the core cognitive features in a large cohort of Brazilian patients with SCA10, comparing the results against a healthy control group. Twenty-eight SCA10 and 28 healthy subjects were prospectively assessed regarding cognitive function and psychiatric disorders at the Movement Disorders Unit of the Federal University of Paran√° between February 2012 and October 2014. The SCA10 group had worse depression scores, as well as cognitive performance, when compared to healthy individuals. Our study showed mild cognitive and mood dysfunctions in patients with SCA10, consistent with the symptoms reported in the Cerebellar Cognitive Affective Syndrome described by Schmahmann JD in 1998. The description of these findings is an important clinical phenomenon that may guide physicians in specific disease management and improve quality of life of these patients.
