Intestinal angioedema is a rare adverse effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. A 42-year old woman presented to the Emergency Department complaining of diffuse abdominal pain, predominantly in the right quadrants, with no other associated symptoms. She had been started on perindopril plus indapamide 72 h before the admission for arterial hypertension. There was no other relevant background. Physical examination suggested peritoneal irritation on the lower quadrants of the abdomen and right flank. Laboratory tests were relevant for mild leukocytosis. Abdomen ultrasound and contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan showed moderate amount of fluid in the pelvic excavation and small intestine wall thickening. She was admitted for observation. Once the hypothesis of intestinal angioedema was admitted, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor was withheld and no other-directed therapy was instituted. Within 24 h she showed clinical, analytic and imaging improvement, thus supporting this diagnosis. The diagnosis of intestinal angioedema induced by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor can be challenging and time consuming due to its rarity and nonspecific symptoms, which may lead to underdiagnosis of this entity.
