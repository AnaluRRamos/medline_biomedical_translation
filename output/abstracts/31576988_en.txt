Inguinal hernias are a frequent problem and their repair is the most commonly performed procedure by general surgeons. In the last years, new principles, products and techniques have changed the routine of surgeons, who need to recycle knowledge and perfect new skills. In addition, old concepts regarding surgical indication and risk of complications have been reevaluated. In order to create a guideline for the management of inguinal hernias in adult patients, the Brazilian Hernia Society assembled a group of experts to review various topics, such as surgical indication, perioperative management, surgical techniques, complications and postoperative guidance.
