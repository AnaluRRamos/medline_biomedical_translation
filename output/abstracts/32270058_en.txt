Health information systems allow for the identification of problems in this field, and often represent the single source of information; therefore, accurate determination of their quality is crucial. To analyze accessibility, opportunity and completeness as criteria for the quality of the information provided by System of Information for Notifiable Conditions (Sistema de Informação sobre Agravos de Notificação - SINAN) on Work Accidents under Exposure to Biological Materials (Acidentes de Trabalho com Exposição a Material Biológico - ATEMB) from 2010 to 2015. Observational and descriptive study based on secondary SINAN data on ATEMB. The object of analysis was all ATEMB records from the 26 Brazilian states and Federal District from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2015. Information is accessible and timely, while the data for the ongoing year are only made available the following one. The percentage of incomplete data in SINAM-ATEMB was high for the following variables: educational level, length of work in the current job, organic materials, serological status of affected individuals and source-patient, measures adopted, case progression and Work Accident Notification (Comunicação de Acidente de Trabalho - CAT); therefore, these variables cannot be included in analyses of risk factors.
