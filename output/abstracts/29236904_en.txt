To report three cases of patients with Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) and retrocochlear impairments. This is a case report of three individuals with SSc and retrocochlear impairments assisted at a rheumatology outpatient clinic. All individuals underwent Brainstem Auditory Evoked Potential (BAEP) and, when necessary, audiometry. All three individuals presented sensorineural hearing loss. Although no retrocochlear impairment was identified in the basic audiologic evaluation, the BAEP results were altered. Retrocochlear impairments were present in the individuals under study, both in the absolute latencies and interpeak interval, thereby demanding the attention of rheumatologists and speech-language pathologists to such changes during the monitoring of SSc patients. The results also show a need for epidemiological studies on the theme.
