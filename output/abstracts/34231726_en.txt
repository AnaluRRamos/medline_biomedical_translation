This article describes a process of territorialization undertaken in Family Health Strategy micro-areas by a team of residents from the Interprofessional Public Health Residency Program at Cariri Regional University using georeferencing tools and the stratification of families according to degree of social vulnerability. A map of social vulnerability was created using SW Maps and Google Earth Pro based on sociodemographic and clinical data obtained from forms A and B of the e-SUS and inputted into an Excel worksheet. The families were stratified into five degrees of vulnerability based on the overall score obtained for a set of socioeconomic and clinical sentinel indicators: without risk, low risk, medium risk, high risk and very high risk. During the territorialization process, we identified streets and side streets and georeferenced points of risk, social facilities, registered and unregistered families, and vacant homes. Over half of the 615 georeferenced families (316 or 51.38%) were not registered in the e-SUS or had not completed their registration at the time of data collection. Most of the 299 registered families (60.53%) were classified as being at low risk and a considerable portion were medium risk.
