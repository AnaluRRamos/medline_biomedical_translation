Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunist pathogen that causes purulent inflammation in the skin and in the ears of dogs. Among the various virulence factors of P. aeruginosa, biofilms have been reported to result in antibiotic resistance, leading to therapeutic limitations. Cold atmospheric microwave plasma (CAMP) is known to have a high antimicrobial effect, which causes physical cell wall rupture and DNA damage. The objective of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial and antibiofilm effects of CAMP against planktonic bacteria and the biofilm of P. aeruginosa. The antibacterial effect of CAMP against P. aeruginosa ATCC10145 and clinical isolates (n = 30) was evaluated using the colony count method. We also assessed the effect of CAMP on biofilm of P. aeruginosa ATCC strain by the colony count method, water-soluble tetrazolium salt (WST) assay and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The complete eradication of P. aeruginosa (ATCC strain and clinical isolates) was achieved within 120 s at 50 W, and clinical isolates required 60 s shorter than the ATCC strain for complete eradication at 50 W. We also confirmed the time-dependent bactericidal effect of CAMP at 50 W against ATCC strain biofilm. CAMP was effective against both planktonic bacteria and biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa. However, further studies on in vivo efficacy and safety in canine skin and ears are necessary to fully validate its clinical application.
