The aim of this study is to extend the reading of the health-disease process from the territorial perspective. Theoretical production on the link between health and the environment should go beyond medical typologies and their emphasis on the distribution of environmental risks (physical, biological, and chemical) to acknowledge the social and subjective production of territories. In order to make progress with this theoretical production, public health should draw on the integration of concepts from the social sciences such as the appropriation of space, territory-territorialities, and places. In terms of scale, it should also focus on micro-territories, since the scenario of local territories and places of daily living are where lifestyles, illness, and the construction of health materialize.
