In the attempt to find a specificity for the Professional Master Program in Public Health (PM), we asked, what is, from the point of view of its means and purposes, kept or broke from the training models of the Academic (traditional) Masters Program (AM). In the public health field, this discussion possess an extra 'flavor', as both program aim, in Brazil, to prepare health professionals to the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS). Therefore, this research sought to investigate the heuristic and innovative vocation of the PM vis-Ã -vis the AM as an education public policy. From a comparative approach, we analyzed the main characteristics and differences among AM and PM, face the flexibilization process of graduate programs in Brazil, and discussed if these features would characterize the PM into an educational public policy. Data was analyzed by the Content Analysis method. We conclude that educational institutions tend to reproduce the AM training model in the PM and the expectation of making the health service matter and reason for training is not sufficient to distinguish both modes.
