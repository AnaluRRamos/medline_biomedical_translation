To describe the anatomical and pathological osteoarticular, muscular and tendinous variations in feet of cadavers with hallux valgus and to correlate them with the degree of radiographic deformity. Dissections and radiographs were conducted in the feet of 22 cadavers with halux valgus, aged between 20 and 70 years. The feet affected were compared with 5 normal feet in order to document the anatomical and pathological, myotendinous and articular variations found. The extensor hallucis longus and brevis tendons were arched in all degrees of deformity, causing a lateral deviation that forms the arc chord of the metatarsophalangeal angle of the hallux. We also observed a deviation to the plantar face of the abductor muscle tendon and lateral deviation of the flexor hallucis muscle tendon. In the moderate deformities, the medial deviation of the first metatarsal head was observed, sliding out of the sesamoid apparatus, pronation of this head, and formation of medial exostoses. In severe deformities, in addition to all other deformities, we found the extensor hallucis longus tendon with two distal insertions, rather than just one. The anatomical alterations found in the hallux valgus may be related to the degree of radiographic deformity <b><i>. Level of Evidence IV, Case series</i>.</b>
