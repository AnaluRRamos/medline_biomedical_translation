The scope of this article is to conduct a critical identification and analysis, based on the analytical framework of the concept of vulnerability of truck drivers to HIV. The criteria for inclusion were to address the issue of truck drivers' susceptibility to HIV/AIDS and to adopt the qualitative approach. A total of 445 abstracts were located, of which 17 articles were included in the analysis and categorized as 'sociocultural studies', 'evaluative studies' and 'risk behavior studies.' The analysis was based on reflections surrounding the concept of vulnerability in health. The study criticizes the predominance of qualitative studies of a behaviorist nature, with an emphasis on the identification of risk behaviors, concepts and representations about HIV/AIDS. Furthermore, it points to studies of a sociocultural and evaluative nature that transcend the barrier of individual behaviors, expanding the scope of analysis, analysis of structural phenomena and interactions of subjects faced with the epidemic, duly approaching the concept of vulnerability. The review reveals the need for studies that take into account the concept of vulnerability, contextualizing the behaviors to the socio-structural dimensions involved in the AIDS epidemic.
