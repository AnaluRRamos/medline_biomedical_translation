Apraxia is a disorder of learned skilled movements, in the absence of elementary motor or sensory deficits and general cognitive impairment such as inattention to commands, object-recognition deficits or poor oral comprehension. The first studies on apraxia were performed between the late 19th and early 20th centuries, however controversy remains in praxis literature concerning apraxia types, neuroanatomical and functional correlates, as well as assessment and treatment of apraxia. Thus, a critical review of the literature was conducted searching the literature for evidence contributing to a more detailed description of apraxia and its clinical patterns, physiopathology and clinico-anatomical correlations, as well as apraxia assessment.
