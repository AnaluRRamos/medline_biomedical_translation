The study aimed to perform a systematic review to identify and evaluate the prevalence of potentially inappropriate medicines (PIM) prescriptions for the elderly, according to Beers Criteria, in hospitalized elderly individuals aged 65 years or older. Five databases consulted: VHL; Cochrane Library; CINAHL; MEDLINE and Web of Science. Nineteen articles identified, selected based on eligibility criteria. The mean age was 78.2 years and the most used criterion for the identification of PIM for the elderly was Beers 2015 (57.9%). A total of 221,879 elderly received a prescription for PIM, the mean prevalence was 65.0%, for the gastrointestinal system (15.3%) and proton-pump inhibitors (27.7%) highlighted as the main class of medicine prescribed. It concluded that the Beers Criteria have made it possible to identify the high prevalence in the prescription of PIM. The results of this review may help in the decision making of health professionals, to avoid the administration of PIM and to propose best practices to ensure the safety of the elderly hospitalized.
