Since the dementias lead to the need for caregivers, a Group for Dementia Caregivers (GC) was set up where the present study compared the psychosocial characteristics, quality of life and caregiver overload in a Group For Dementia Caregivers (GC) with caregivers not involved in this scheme (non-GC). 19 primary caregivers counseled by this group (GC group) was studied and compared to a group of 13 caregivers not receiving such counseling (non-GC group). The instruments used were the World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-bref), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and Caregiver Load Scale (CLS). The two groups did not differ in mean age or gender (P<0.05). GC caregivers had a higher educational level, were service workers where majority were the children of patients. In the Non-CG group, the most frequent occupation was housewife, with most subjects being spouses. The WHOQOL revealed a significant difference (p<0.05) between groups in the physical, social relations and environment domains (GC>Non-GC). The STAI revealed a significant difference (p<0.05) in the Trait subscale (GC>Non-GC), but not in the State subscale. There was no significant difference in CLS. The GC appeared to be of benefit to its participants, with probable positive repercussions on the patients, particularly regarding their quality of life.
