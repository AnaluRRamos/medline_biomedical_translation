Analyze the outcomes of proximal femoral locking compression plate (PF-LCP) in these complex fractures. This study retrospectively analyzed 21 proximal femoral fractures treated with PF-LCP from June 2013 to February 2015. There were 15 females (71%) and six males (29%) with an average age of 61.4 years (range: 34-80 years). The peritrochanteric fractures constituted by intertrochanteric and subtrochanteric fractures were classified by the Boyd and Griffin classification and Seinshemier's classification, respectively. Among them, 16 cases (76%) were of intertrochanteric and five cases (24%) were of subtrochanteric fracture pattern. The functional outcome was assessed by Harris Hip Score and the Parker Palmer mobility score one year post-surgery. Among 21 patients, 19 patients obtained fracture union without further intervention; two patients required additional bone grafting. No cases of the hip screw cutting the femoral head were noted. There was no post-operative mortality in this study. The average Harris Hip Score was 84.5 (range: 83-94). The assessment by Parker and Palmar mobility score was 7.5 (range: 4-9). The PF-LCP is a good, stable alternative in the treatment of peritrochanteric femoral fractures. It provides good-to-excellent bone healing with reduced complications.
