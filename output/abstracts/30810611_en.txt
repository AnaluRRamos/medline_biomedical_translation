Describe hearing complaints and alterations in individuals with systemic sclerosis (SS) and to verify the development of audiological manifestations. This is a cross-sectional study with a prospective phase, conducted in the period from 2012 to 2015, with patients with medical diagnosis of SS. Sociodemographic data, year of disease onset, year of diagnosis and disease subtype were collected. Later, audiological anamnesis was performed to identify complaints and symptoms and to investigate the performance of audiometry before the study and, after that, a basic audiological evaluation was conducted. Fifty individuals participated in the study. Dizziness and tinnitus were the most frequent symptoms. Hearing loss was identified in 23 (46%) individuals; most of them were of sensorineural type, of variable degrees and configurations. The analysis of hearing thresholds obtained in the audiological evaluation performed in 2012 and, later, in 2015, indicated onset or progression of hearing loss, with aggravation of 10dB in most frequencies evaluated, being more expressive in acute frequencies. High rate of hearing complaints and alterations in individuals with SS and onset and/or progression of hearing loss in those who underwent serial audiological evaluation were observed.
