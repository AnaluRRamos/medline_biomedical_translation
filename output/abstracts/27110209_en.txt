The fish fauna of freshwater streams in the Tapajos National Forest was surveyed and a list of species is presented. The sampling was conducted from 2012 to 2013 during the dry season. Fish were collected with dip nets and seine nets in 22 streams of 1(st) to 3(rd) order. Sampling resulted in 3035 specimens belonging to 117 species, 27 families and six orders. The most abundant species were Bryconops aff. melanurus, Hemigrammus belottii, and Hemigrammus analis. Four undescribed species were recognized, one of which is known only from the area of this study. A significant dissimilarity was observed in fish species composition among drainage systems. This is the first survey of the stream ichthyofauna in the Tapaj√≥s National Forest, and it presents relevant information for future studies and decision-making in the management and conservation of fish fauna in this conservation unit.
