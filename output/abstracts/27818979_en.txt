Evaluate the functional grade of these patients and to identify the types of complications found that influenced the average life span of endoprostheses the functions of the operated limb. We analyzed 14 post-operative cases of endoprosthesis, patients with malignant bone tumors and aggressive benign bone tumors submitted to surgery between 2004 and 2014. The evaluation system used was proposed by Enneking, recommended by the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS), in addition to the radiologic evaluation. Endoprosthesis are excellent choices for the treatment of bone tumors with limb preservation in relation to pain, strength, and patient's emotional acceptance. Another factor for good results is the immediate weight-bearing capacity, generating a greater independence. The authors conclude that all patients classified the therapy as excellent/good, regardless of the type of prosthesis used, extent of injury, and/or type of tumor resection performed.
