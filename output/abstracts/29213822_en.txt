Besides its typical amnesic presentation, focal atypical presentations of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been described in neuropathological studies. These phenotypical variants of AD (so-called 'atypical AD') do not follow the typical amnestic pattern and include non-amnestic focal cortical syndromes, such as posterior cortical atrophy and frontal variant AD. These variants exhibit characteristic histological lesions of Alzheimer pathology at <i>post-mortem</i> exam. By using physiopathological markers, such as cerebrospinal fluid markers, it is now possible to establish <i>in vivo</i> a biological diagnosis of AD in these focal cortical syndromes. We report a series of eight patients who were diagnosed with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia based on their clinical, neuropsychological and neuroimaging findings, while CSF biomarkers showed an AD biological profile, thus supporting a diagnosis of frontal variant of AD.
