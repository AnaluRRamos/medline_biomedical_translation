to evaluate the efficacy of Baccharis dracunculifolia extract in the treatment of anal fistulas in rats. twenty male Wistar rats were submitted to anal fistula and, after 30 days, were divided into three groups: Control Group, with five animals; Carbopol Group, with five animals; and Baccharis dracunculifolia Group, with ten animals. In the Control Group, no treatment was performed. In the Carbopol Group, a daily infusion of Carbopol was performed for 30 days. In the Baccharis dracunculifolia Group, a daily infusion of Carbopol plus Baccharis dracunculifolia extract was performed for 30 days. Specimens were taken for histological analysis after euthanasia. there was no complete closure of the fistulous tract in any of the animals. The mean area of the remaining tract was of 847.2µm2, 565.6µm2 and 372.7µm2, in the Control Group, Carbopol Group, and Baccharis dracunculifolia Group, respectively, (p=0.001). The mean of the inflammatory process score was of 2.4, 2.4, and 2.1, in the Control Group, Carbopol Group, and Baccharis dracunculifolia Group, respectively, (p=0.285), while the mean values of vascular congestion were of 1.6, 1.4, and 1.1, in the Control Group, Carbopol Group, and Baccharis dracunculifolia Group, respectively, (p=0.031). Baccharis dracunculifolia extract was able to reduce the lumen of the fistulous tracts and the degree of vascular congestion, without, however, reducing the local inflammatory process or totally closing the fistulous tracts.
