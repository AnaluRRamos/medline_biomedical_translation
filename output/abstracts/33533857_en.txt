The article aimed to evaluate the mediating role of parental self-efficacy (PSE) between socioenvironmental factors and the mental health of the mothers of children with congenital zika syndrome (CZS). The socio-environmental factors were based on the cognitive and affective evaluation that people make of their context (subjective well-being, SWB) and fatigue. Sixty-six mothers with a mean age of 26.4 years of children with CZS in the state of Cear√°, participated in this study. A questionnaire with the following scales was applied: Positive and Negative Affect Scale, Life Satisfaction Scale, Fatigue Evaluation Scale, General Health Questionnaire, Parental Self-efficacy Scale. The results indicated that the components of SWB, negative affects and life satisfaction, significantly predicted the mental health of mothers of children with CZS, and the PSE predicts better levels of mental health. It was observed that the PSE plays a mediating role in the relationship of satisfaction with life, negative effects and fatigue with mental health. PSE is an important psychological mechanism that acts as a mediator between the socio-environmental context and mental health. Thus, intervention strategies aimed at increasing the feelings of PSE in mothers can have a positive impact on the improvement of their mental health.
