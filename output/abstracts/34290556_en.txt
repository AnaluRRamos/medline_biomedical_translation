Our aim was to describe the foot alignment in National Football League (NFL) players with different symptomatic foot and ankle pathologies using weightbearing cone-beam computed tomography (WBCBCT), comparing them to normally aligned feet as control group. 41 feet (36 active NFL players) were assessed using WBCBCT and compared to 20 normally aligned controls from a normal population. Measurements included: Foot and Ankle Offset (FAO); Calcaneal Offset (CO); Hindfoot Alignment Angle (HAA); angle between inferior and superior facets of the talus (Inftal-Suptal); angle between inferior facet of the talus and the horizontal/floor (Inftal-Hor); Forefoot Arch Angle (FAA); navicular- and medial cuneiform-to-floor distance. NFL athletes showed a neutrally aligned hindfoot when compared to controls (FAO: 1% vs 0.5%; CO: 2.3 mm vs 0.8 mm; HAA: 2.9째 vs 0.8째 in two groups, with all <i>p</i> > 0.05) and a normal morphology of the subtalar joint (no difference in Inftal-Suptal and Inftal-Hor angles). Conversely, in athletes we found a decreased medial longitudinal arch (FAA: 15째 vs 18.3째, <i>p</i> = 0.03) with smaller navicular (38.2 mm vs 42.2 mm, <i>p</i> = 0.03) and medial cuneiform (27 mm vs 31.3 mm, <i>p</i> = 0.01) mean distances to the floor when compared to controls. In our series, NFL players presented a lower medial longitudinal arch than controls but a neutrally aligned hindfoot. WBCBCT may help shed light on anatomical risk factors for injuries in professional players. <b>Level of Evidence III, Retrospective comparative study.</b>
