Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a social and public health concern. This article aims to identify factors associated with death in women with IPV notification. This is a case-control study based on the record-linkage of the Mortality Information System (SIM), from 2011 to September/2017, and the Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN), 2011 to 2016. The 'case' group consisted of women aged 15 to 59 years old with notification of violence on SINAN, whose author was current or former intimate partner and died by any cause registered on SIM. The 'control' group consisted of women 15-59 years old, living in the same municipality of the cases and victim of IPV registered on SINAN, but without a death record on SIM. Multiple logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio of death. 151,826 Brazilian women were victim of IPV and were notified by SINAN, and 2,538 died. The main cause of death was homicide. The following characteristics conferred a greater chance of death: having race/skin-color black or yellow; having disabilities; living in rural area; physical violence, torture and multiple types combined; violence perpetrated by a firearm, a sharp object and multiple means combined.
