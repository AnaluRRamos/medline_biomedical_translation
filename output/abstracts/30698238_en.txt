Frailty is a state of multisystem physiological vulnerability related to aging and an increased risk of adverse outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and associated factors of frailty in the Fibra-JF Study, Minas Gerais, Brazil. We selected a random sample of 461 individuals aged 65 years or more stratified by territorial unit, gender and age. The frailty syndrome was established by the presence of three or more of five items: a feeling of exhaustion, low handgrip strength, slow gait speed, weight loss, and low caloric expenditure. The mean age was 74.4 (SD Â± 6.8) years, 69.6% were women and 71.9% white. The prevalence of frailty was 5.2%; 49.9% was from pre-frail subjects. Advanced age (OR: 6.4; CI 1.76-23.8), impairment of the basic activities of daily living (OR: 5.2, CI 1.1-23.1) and self-perception of poor health (OR: 0.13, CI 0.03-0.4) were associated with frailty. In this study, a substantial number of individuals was classified as frail, while half of the sample was at risk of progression towards this condition, suggesting that it is urgent to adopt public health measures focused on frailty prevention and reduction of associated adverse health outcomes.
