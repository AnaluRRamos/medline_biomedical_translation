This experimental study aimed to evaluate the biological performance of poly (l-co-D, l-lactic acid)-co-trimetilene carbonate/poly (vinyl alcohol) (PLDLA-co TMC/PVA), hydrogel scaffolds, as an implant in the filling (and not in the repair) of osteochondral defects in New Zealand rabbits, assessing the influence of the material in tissue protection <i>in vivo</i>. Twelve rabbits were divided into groups of nine and 16 weeks. In each animal, an osteochondral defect was created in both medial femoral condyles. In one knee, a hydrogel scaffold was implanted (pin group) and in the other, the defect was maintained (control group). A histological analysis of the material was performed after euthanasia. The condyles of the pin group showed no inflammatory reaction and were surrounded by a fibrous capsule. The control group presented higher bone growth in the areas of the defect, but with disorganized articular cartilage, evident fibrosis, bone exposure, atrophy, and proliferation of synovial membrane. The hydrogel pins are promising in <i>filling</i> osteochondral defects, generally do not cause inflammatory reactions, and are not effective in the <i>repair</i> of osteochondral defects.
