To describe the occurrence of social welfare benefits related to AIDS in Brazil and to compare the characteristics of the beneficiaries of social assistance and social security in 2004 - 2016. This was an observational, analytical study based on secondary data obtained from the Ministry of Social Security of Brazil. Sociodemographic and epidemiologic characteristics of the beneficiaries of AIDS-related social assistance and social security were analyzed. From 2004 - 2016, a total of 99 369 benefits were granted, the majority of which were sick pay (64%), followed by social assistance benefits (26.5%) and disability retirement (8.1%). At the time that benefits were initiated, 51% of the individuals were unemployed. Those living in urban areas, females, the young, the elderly, and residents of the North and Northeast received more social assistance benefits. Duration of social assistance benefits (average 4 589 days) was greater than that of social security benefits (302 days). Survival among women (578 months) was greater than among men (311 months). In Brazil, the profile of social welfare beneficiaries living with AIDS reveals their social vulnerability. Controlling AIDS should be a priority on public agendas, aiming to minimize the disease's social and economic impact, especially on public health, social security, and social assistance.
