To analyze reformatted sagittal sternal tomography images and classify sternal body curvature types, and compare different types of <i>pectus</i> populations with one another and with normal individuals. In total, 50 controls and 167 pectus patients were selected for chest CT to analyze the median sagittal plane, of whom 89 had <i>pectus carinatum (</i>mean age, 12 ± 10 years) and 78 <i>pectus excavatum</i> (mean age, 14 ± 10 years). Clinical types of <i>pectus</i> were classified as inferior, superior, or lateral <i>pectus carinatum,</i> and localized or broad <i>pectus excavatum.</i> The following types of sternal patterns were defined: gradual vertical curve, gradual posterior curve, gradual anterior curve, proximal third curve, middle third curve, distal third curve, anterior rectilinear, vertical rectilinear, and posterior rectilinear. Statistical analyses were performed to compare the different types of <i>pectus</i> with one another and with the control group. Patients with different thoracic deformities, but with similar sternal curvature patterns, were observed. Some types of sternal curvature were significantly more frequent in certain types of <i>pectus</i> (p < 0,05). The gradual vertical curve and anterior rectilinear types prevailed in controls (p < 0,05). Some sternal curvature patterns were more frequent than the others in certain types of <i>pectus</i> and the controls. <b><i>Level of Evidence II, Prognostic studies - investigating the effect of a patient characteristic on the outcome of disease.</i></b>
