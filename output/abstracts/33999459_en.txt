Dermatophagoides farinae (Der f) is a common allergen in dogs with atopic dermatitis (AD). However, the relevant components of Der f require further investigation. We aimed to provide data on the immunoglobulin (Ig)E-binding specific components of Der f for further diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Serum samples were collected from five healthy, nine Der f-allergic atopic and seven non-Der f-allergic atopic dogs identified based on an intradermal skin test. We explored the component profiles of Der f extracts through 2D gel electrophoresis and IgE immunoblotting. The IgE-binding components in both groups of atopic dogs were analysed by mass spectrometry. The majority of Der f-allergic atopic dogs recognised Der f Alternaria alternata allergen 10 (Der f Alt a 10), elongation factor 1-alpha (EF1-α), gelsolin-like allergen Der f 16, Der f 28 and Der f 2. Der f 3, Der f 10, Der f 20 and Der f 32 were recognised as minor allergens. Alpha-enolase, serine protease, arginine kinase and a few hypothetical proteins were recognised components in both groups of atopic dogs. Unexpectedly, Der f 15 (chitinase) was found to be a minor component. Multiple IgE-binding allergens of Der f were identified in Thai atopic dogs. We propose that the specific antigen set that is bound by IgE, comprising Der f Alt a 10, EF1-α, gelsolin-like Der f 16, Der f 28 and Der f 2, could be used for future diagnostics and immunotherapy platforms.
