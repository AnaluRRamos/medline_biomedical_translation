Changes in the demographic profile over recent decades, especially population aging, have implications for Brazilian public policies. This study aims to analyze how family health strategy teams implement and carry out care for the elderly in a Brazilian municipality. The qualitative field research was conducted by collecting data through semistructured interviews using Minayo as a point of reference and employing thematic content analysis. One observation was that the National Health Policy for Elderly People (Política Nacional de Saúde da Pessoa Idosa - PNSPI) has been facing challenges in its implementation at the municipal level in terms of the lack of specific actions by the PNSPI, limited actions or lack of accessibility, lack of training for health professionals, hiring and management of workers, intersectoral actions, and management. It was concluded that a better outlook for the implementation of the PNSPI in the context of the aging population will require strengthening actions through the precepts of comanagement, an expanded clinic, and health education to increase individuals' independence.
