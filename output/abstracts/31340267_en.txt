This study aimed to analyze the prevalence of this condition and associated factors in adult quilombolas (inhabitants of black communities). In a population-based study with a sample of 850 adults of both sexes, MS was determined using the Joint Interim Statement criteria. Hierarchical Poisson regression modeling was used to test the associations. The prevalence of MS was 25.8% (95%CI: 22.8:28.7). In multiple analysis, gender, age group, sleep quality, body mass index and fat percentage remained significantly associated (p < 0.05). In this respect, the presence of SM in adult quilombolas is associated with female gender, age â‰¥ 40 years, poor sleep quality, overweight, and obesity.
