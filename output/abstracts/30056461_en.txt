The aim of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxic effects of 2. 5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), 17% ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), and 1% peracetic acid (PAA) on human fibroblasts. FG11 and FG15 cell lines were cultured in 24-well cell culture plates for cell proliferation assessment and 96-well cell culture plates for the methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay; Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) was used as control data. The experimental solutions were used at 0. 01%, 0. 05%, and 0. 1% dilutions and assessed at 1-, 2-, and 4-hour intervals. Data were subjected to statistical analysis by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by the Bonferroni test at a significance level of p <0. 05. The assessment of cell proliferation in this study showed cytotoxicity to the fibroblasts with 2. 5% NaOCl for all three dilutions at all time intervals, 17% EDTA for the 0. 05% and 0. 1% dilutions at the 2- and 4-hour intervals, and 1% PAA for all three dilutions at the 4-hour interval. The cell viability assay (MTT assay) for fibroblasts showed 2. 5% NaOCl to be cytotoxic at the 0. 05% and 0. 1% dilutions at all time intervals, 17% EDTA to be cytotoxic at the 0. 1% dilution at the 2- and 4-hour intervals, and 1% PAA to be cytotoxic at the 0. 1% dilution at the 2- and 4-hour intervals. In conclusion, 1% PAA was less cytotoxic than 2. 5% NaOCl and 17% EDTA.
