The scope of this study was to analyze matrix support in mental health from the practices and conceptions brought by reference teams, matrix teams and managers on the topic. To achieve this, semi structured interviews were conducted with 41 participants, among whom there were 11 managers, 12 reference team professionals from Health Units and 18 matrix team professionals from Psychosocial Care Centers, in addition to 110 hours of observations of matrix practices based on field journal records. The data were then submitted to content analysis. From the information gathered by the participants, two lines of thought were highlighted about the concept of Matrix Support, namely as a forum for productive meetings between health teams on the one hand, and as a strategy of training-on-the-job on the other. These concepts were discussed in juxtaposition with the data brought from the observations of the daily work in practice. Because of this contradiction, it was possible to perceive the need to create, systematize and strengthen spaces for dialog between reference teams, matrix teams and managers, such that the consolidation of matrix support may occur.
