This paper aims to evaluate the performance of PHC from the perspective of users and its association with sociodemographic characteristics, self-reported health conditions, and behavioral risk factors for Chronic Noncommunicable Diseases. This is a population-based cross-sectional study with data from the 2015 VIGITEL Telephone Survey. The Primary Care Assessment Tool short version was adopted. The study population covers adults over 18 years of age who used PHC services in Belo Horizonte in the last 12 months (n = 872). The multiple logistic regression model was performed to estimate the odds ratio. We observed that adults without a health insurance plan are 3.21 (95% CI 2.08-4.96) more likely than those with a health insurance plan to evaluate PHC with a high score (â‰¥ 6.6), and adults with low schooling (95% CI 1.48-5.32), people with diabetes (95% CI 1.05-3.24), obese (95% CI 1.20-3.24), and older adults (95% CI 1.00-1.41) were 2.81, 1.84, 1.97, and 1.19 more likely to report a high score for PHC quality than the others, respectively. The use of the PCATool short version in a telephone survey showed a new possibility for PHC performance assessment and can become useful in managing health services.
