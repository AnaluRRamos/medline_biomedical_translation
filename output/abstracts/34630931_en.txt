Rasmussen encephalitis is a rare disease consisting of a chronic, slowly progressive inflammatory reaction of brain tissues. The objective of this study was to describe the case of an 18-year-old female patient, studying on the fourth grade of elementary school, and right-handed, who underwent left hemispherectomy in a neurological rehabilitation program. Her seizures began at 10 years of age and were unresponsive to drug treatment, with functional repercussions. She underwent hemispherectomy in March 2019, with 7 years of ongoing disease, and was admitted for the rehabilitation program with a multidisciplinary team in June 2020. The quality-of-life questionnaire (WHOQOL-BREF) was applied as a comparison measure before and after the rehabilitation program, along with measures of participation on the program activities. Despite the patient's short time in a rehabilitation program, data show the importance of an interdisciplinary intervention through the establishment of specific and contextualized objectives in chronic patients.
