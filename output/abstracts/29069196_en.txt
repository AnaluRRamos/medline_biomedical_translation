This paper aimed to identify the priority Health Regions of Rio Grande do Sul (RS) to implement Health Surveillance strengthening actions. This is a descriptive study with data from time series of 11 (eleven) Health Surveillance indicators of the Ministry of Health's 2016 Guidelines, Objectives, Targets and Indicators Journal agreed by the Bipartite Interagency Committee/RS. The selected indicators are synthesized to produce a Composite Health Surveillance Assessment Indicator (ICAVES) for each of the 30 Health Regions of the state, creating values ranging from zero (worst) to 1 (best), using the Human Development Index (HDI) construction calculation method. The lowest rates of the composite indicator are found in the Health Regions '20-Rota da Produção' and '19-Região do Botucaraí'. These two Health Regions are priorities for the strengthening of collective Health Surveillance actions and the management of health risks and diseases, considering horizontal equity as guideline of the Unified Health System.
