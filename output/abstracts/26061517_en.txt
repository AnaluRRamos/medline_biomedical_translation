A 69-years-old male patient was treated with amiodarone 200mg/day over the passed two months for atrial fibrillation. He presented a sudden, painless and unilateral visual loss. Ophthalmologic evaluation revealed a bilateral optic disc edema. Neurological examination was otherwise unremarkable. After properly excluding increased intracranial pressure and giant cell arteritis, the main differential diagnosis was between nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy and optic neuropathy secondary to amiodarone. The latter diagnosis was favored due to a presence of bilateral and simultaneous optic disc edema, gradual improvement of symptoms after discontinuation of the drug, and, mostly, by persistence of optic disc edema beyond 6 weeks. Of note, an acute presentation of this disorder is common. Amiodarone optic neuropathy is a rare but potentially serious cause of optic nerve dysfunction, and its discontinuation is usually warrant.
