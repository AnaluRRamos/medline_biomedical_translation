The scope of this article was to identify the profile of users and the prescription of drugs in the Psychosocial Care Centers (CAPS) in a region of Minas Gerais, Brazil. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 11 CAPS of 5 different modalities. Sociodemographic data and information about drug use were obtained through interviews with users and analysis of prescriptions and medical records, using a semi-structured questionnaire. The mean number of drugs prescribed per user in CAPS was 3.38 (± 1.76) and the amounts were 4.08 (± 1.56), 3.54 (± 1.64) and 2.00 (± 1.66) for CAPS Alcohol and Drugs (CAPS ad), CAPS II and III and CAPS for children (CAPSi), respectively. The most prescribed therapeutic class was antipsychotics, with emphasis on haloperidol. Users in the economically active age group attended larger units (24h) or the CAPS ad modality and reported that in the past they had used drugs inappropriately and had a higher prevalence of prescriptions containing 5 drugs or more. The profile of drug use in the CAPS differed according to the modality of the service, and a greater degree of utilization was observed in the CAPS ad units. The differences revealed may subsidize discussion of the strategies for promoting the rational use of drugs.
