The risk of fracture or strain in mini-screws is higher if diameter, length, type of alloy or insertion angle is selected inappropriately. The aims of this study were to test the structural resistance of two types of orthodontic mini-screws -one made of stainless steel and another of titanium- from an international brand and to evaluate the efficacy of two other titanium miniscrews of Brazilian origin, during an extra-alveolar anchorage procedure. The mini-screws analyzed were: Bomei stainless steel and Bomei titanium / Taiwan, Morelli titanium and Neodent titanium/ Brazil. Experiments were conducted on pig mandibles to simulate the process of extra-alveolar anchorage. Two insertion processes were used: Direct at 30ยบ, and Indirect, starting at 60ยบ and ending at 30ยบ with gradual continuous movement. Strain was evaluated using Optical and Scanning Electron Microscopy. Data were evaluated using Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric statistical analysis and post hoc Tamhane test. Significant statistical differences in strain were observed among the mini-screws used in the extra-alveolar insertions, both for the direct and indirect procedures. In the indirect insertion tests, both stainless steel and titanium mini-screws suffered deformation, showing that angling can be an important factor in mini-screw failure rates. The change in angle during the insertion movement increased deformation rates independently of alloy type, increasing the risk of failure. These results could help orthodontists in choosing mini-screws for extra-alveolar anchorage, which can be performed with direct or indirect insertion. In vivo studies should be conducted to confirm the findings of this study.
