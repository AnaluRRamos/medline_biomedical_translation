Psoriasis is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory disease that affects up to 1-3% of the general population. An advanced understanding of the immune-pathogenesis of psoriasis has led to the development of new drugs that refine existing treatments or target novel molecular and immunologic pathways. IL-17 and Th17 cells play an important role in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders, including psoriasis. IL-17A, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, is produced by Th17 cells along with other effector cytokines, such as IL-17F an IL-22, but it is also expressed by other cells of the innate immune system, including mast cells, neutrophils or dendritic cells, that are found in psoriatic lesions. For this reason IL-17 has emerged as an attractive therapeutic target. Agents that inhibit IL-17 are in development and preliminary clinical results are promising, confirming the importance of IL-17 in psoriasis pathophysiology. Their selective intervention in the immune system makes them an attractive therapeutic approach to autoimmune diseases, particularly psoriasis, being possible that in the near future these novel therapies could be a valid alternative for currently available biologic agents.
