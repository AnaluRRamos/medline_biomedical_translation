Self-Determination Theory explores the process through which a person acquires motivation to initiate new behaviours related to health and to maintain them over time. This study aimed to determine the overall fit of Self-Determination Theory Model for Health Behavior to the data obtained from a sample of smokers hospitalized with acute coronary syndrome, and to identify the predictors of smoking status six months after clinical discharge. The sample included 110 participants, regular smokers, hospitalized due to acute coronary syndrome. Questionnaires were administered to assess autonomous self-regulation, perceived competence, family support, depressive symptoms and meaning in life. Participants were asked if they were currently smokers six months after clinical discharge. The results showed that the process variables specified by Self-Determination Theory fit the data well. Perceived competence predicted abstinence from smoking six months after clinical discharge. Our findings have similar characteristics to other international samples in which Self-Determination Theory models havebeen tested. It is important to facilitate perceived competence, as the patients who continue to smoke have shorter length of life. This study highlights the importance of considering clinical interventions based on Self-Determination Theory to facilitatesmoking cessation.
