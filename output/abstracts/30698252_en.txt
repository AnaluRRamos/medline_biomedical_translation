The scope of this study was to describe the prevalence of depressive symptoms measured by the Geriatric Depression Scale-EDG - 15 and test the association of oral health variables and depressive symptoms in a population of the elderly linked to eleven Family Health Units in the south of Brazil. It involved a cross-sectional study with 439 elderly individuals. A standardized questionnaire was used to obtain socio-economic and oral health variables of the study. The clinical variables of oral health were obtained by a qualified dentist. The symptoms of depression, which was the scope of the study, were obtained by the Geriatric Depression Scale-EDG -15. The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 18.3% (CI95% 14.6-21.8). Analyzing the exposure variables and depressive symptoms through adjusted Poisson regression analysis, individuals with 1 to 9 teeth (PR = 1.68; CI95% 1.06-2.64, p = 0.012), with a perception of dry mouth (PR = 2.23; CI95% 1.52-3.28, p < 0.001) and perception of pain in the mouth (PR = 2.11; CI95% 1.10-4.07, p = 0.036) have a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms. The study identified a significant prevalence of depressive symptoms and that oral health variables are associated with the presence of depressive symptoms in the elderly population.
