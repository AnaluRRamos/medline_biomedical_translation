To provide an analysis of the 50 most cited articles on knee surgery in the Brazilian medical literature. This is a study of systematic review and meta-analysis, level of evidence 3. It was carried out through search in the SCOPUS database to identify scientific articles published in the Brazilian medical literature. Eighty-six Brazilian journals were analyzed, and articles with ten or more citations and which had the word '<i>joelho</i>' or 'knee' in the title, abstract or keywords were selected. All articles were published as of the year 2000 in 14 journals. The Journal Clinics presented the largest number of publications, followed by Acta Ortop√©dica Brasileira. The main focus of the studies was on anatomy and biomechanics, mainly from Brazilian authors. Most of the authors were Brazilian, from Brazilian and public research institutions. Biometric analysis has been gaining ground in recent years, but its interpretation must consider various aspects related to the paramount analytical importance.
