Arrector pili muscle (APM) hamartoma is reported in humans and dogs. We describe a linear APM hamartoma in a sphynx cat. The lesion was characterized by multiple nodules distributed linearly along the tail, made of randomly arranged hypertrophic smooth muscles, the size of which tended to wax-and-wane during a one year follow-up.
