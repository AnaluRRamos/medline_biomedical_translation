to analyze evolution as to conducting seven or more prenatal consultations with pregnant women in Brazil, in the period 2000-2015 according to maternal education level and race/skin color of the newborn baby. this was a time series study based on Live Births Information System (SINASC) data; relative and absolute inequalities were investigated, adjusted for maternal age and gestational week in which childbirth occurred. we analyzed approximately 48 million births; the proportion of seven or more prenatal consultations increased nationally (from 46.0% to 66.9%) in all groups analyzed; the relative difference between the extremes of education level ranged from 3.0 to 2.0, while the absolute difference ranged from 53.1 to 47.7 percentage points; the adjusted ratio between White/Black race/skin color was 1.4 in 2000 and 1.2 in 2015. the proportion of pregnant women having seven or more prenatal consultations has increased in Brazil, although inequalities are still found.
