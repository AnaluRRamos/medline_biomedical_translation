Cognitive decline is a frequent but undervalued aspect of multiple sclerosis (MS). Currently, it remains unclear what the strongest determinants of cognitive dysfunction are, with grey matter damage most directly related to cognitive impairment. Multi-parametric studies seem to indicate that individual factors of MS-pathology are highly interdependent causes of grey matter atrophy and permanent brain damage. They are associated with intermediate functional effects (e.g. in functional MRI) representing a balance between disconnection and (mal) adaptive connectivity changes. Therefore, a more comprehensive MRI approach is warranted, aiming to link structural changes with functional brain organization. To better understand the disconnection syndromes and cognitive decline in MS, this paper reviews the associations between MRI metrics and cognitive performance, by discussing the interactions between multiple facets of MS pathology as determinants of brain damage and how they affect network efficiency.
