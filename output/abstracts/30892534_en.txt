In developed countries, violence is the main cause of oral maxillofacial (OMF) injuries. In Brazil, there are scant records of such lesions. The scope of this study was to detail the OMF injuries resulting from physical aggression in a capital of the Brazilian northeast and analyze gender differences. The Forensic Medicine Institute of São Luís, state of Maranhão, featured 15,847 reports, which occurred in 2012, and they were investigated. Socioeconomic, demographic data and OMF characteristics were analyzed. The Chi-square and Fisher's Exact tests were applied to assess gender differences. Of the cases examined, 1977 were OMF. Female victims, aged 20-59, dark-skinned, without a partner and maids were the most affected. Ecchymosis-type lesions, in the mouth and lip regions arising from the use of blunt instruments, causing permanent functional impairment, were the most prevalent in women (P < 0.05), whereas dental fracture and contusion arising from sharp instruments causing permanent deformity, occupational disability, and threat to life were detected in men (P < 0.05). The conclusion drawn is that the incidence of OMF due to physical aggression is high in São Luís, state of Maranhão, and although women are the most affected, the OMF in men are more severe.
