This study examined the mortality trend due to chronic renal failure (CRF) and verified the underlying and associated causes for this trend in the capital of the state of Acre in the Brazilian Amazon. This ecological study used data provided by DATASUS related to mortality due to CRF, which occurred between 1986 and 2012 for male and female residents of the city of Rio Branco, Acre, Brazil. The estimated annual percentage chance (EAPC) was calculated by using Poisson log-linear regression and utilizing the Joinpoint program. The results showed that the adjusted mortality rates due to CRF, with correction, ranged from 15.4 per 100,000 inhabitants in 1986 to 4.0 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2012. The EAPC was -3.5% from 1986- 2012. Deaths by CRF presented associated causes such as respiratory diseases, pneumonia and pulmonary edema, septicemias and poorly defined signs and symptoms. When CRF was analyzed as an associated cause of death, the main primary causes of death were hypertensive diseases and diabetes. Thus, there was a decrease in mortality due to CRF as an underlying cause during the period studied; however, preventive and heath care measures should be maintained.
