Antifungal shampoos are widely used for canine Malassezia dermatitis. Few studies have evaluated effective bathing methods for atopic dogs with Malassezia overgrowth. To evaluate the efficacy of an emollient bathing product (AFLOAT VET) and 2% miconazole/2% chlorhexidine shampoo (2% MIC/CHX) in atopic dogs, and to evaluate the influence on skin barrier function of both products in healthy dogs. Sixteen atopic dogs with secondary Malassezia overgrowth and 11 healthy dogs. This study was a randomized, single-blinded trial. The dogs were randomly treated with either emollient bathing or 2% MIC/CHX, twice weekly for four weeks. Clinical assessment used the Canine Atopic Dermatitis Extent and Severity Index, 4<sup>th</sup> iteration (CADESI-04), pruritus Visual Analog Scale (pVAS), and cytological evaluation of yeast numbers at Day (D)0, D14 and D28. Skin barrier function was determined by measuring transepidermal water loss (TEWL) after a single bathing procedure with each product in the healthy dogs. The pVAS scores and yeast counts were significantly reduced on D28 compared with D0 in both groups (P < 0.05). CADESI-04 was significantly decreased on D28 in the emollient bathing group (P = 0.003). There were no significant differences in each endpoint score between the groups. In healthy dogs, TEWL was significantly increased after bathing in both groups (P < 0.01). An emollient bathing product can be effective for Malassezia overgrowth in dogs with atopic dermatitis. Bathing with shampoo products might affect skin barrier function even when using an emollient product.
