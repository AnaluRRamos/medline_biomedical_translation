Bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) devices utilize biophysical modeling to generate body composition data. The addition of body mass index (BMI) to modified Xitron-Hanai-based mixture equations improved BIS estimates of intracellular water (ICW), particularly at the extremes of BMI. A 3-compartment model for distinguishing excess fluid (ExF) from normally hydrated lean (NHLT) and adipose tissue may further improve BIS estimates. We aimed to validate a BIS approach based on the Chamney model for determining fat mass (FM) in healthy individuals (NHANES) and for measuring FM changes in individuals undergoing massive weight loss. Using adult NHANES 1999-2004 (2821 female, 3063 male) and longitudinal pre-to-post-RYGB (15F) data, we compared dual-energy-X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and BIS for FM. We applied BIS adiposity-corrected values to Chamney equations for normally hydrated lean and adipose tissue (NHLT, NHAT) and FM. Method agreement was evaluated by correlations, paired t-tests, root mean square error (RMSE), Bland-Altman (B-A) analysis, and concordance correlation coefficients (CCC). Method agreement between BIS and DXAFM was good in healthy adults (r=0.96, CCC=0.93, p<.0001), and pre-to-post-RYGB (r=0.93-0.98, CCC=0.81-0.86, p<.001). Although cross-sectional FM measures differed, FM change measures post-RYGB did not (35.6±8.9 vs. 35.2±9.2 kg, BIS vs. DXA) and agreed well (r=0.84, p<.0001). The 15 subjects with follow-up measurements at 1 year lost 11.5±9.8 kg FFM by DXA, but only 1.3±2.5 kg of NHLT by BIS, suggesting that the FFM loss may have been mostly adipose tissue water. Incorporation of the Chamney model into BIS algorithms is a major conceptual advancement for assessing and monitoring body composition. Its ability to differentiate ICW and extracellular water (ECW) in NHLT and NHAT, as well as excess ECW is promising, and would facilitate lean tissue monitoring in obesity and acute/chronic disease.
