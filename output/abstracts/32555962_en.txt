The purpose of this study was to assess the quality of life of patients who had undergone bilateral thoracic sympathectomy from R5 to R8 as a treatment for severe and debilitating compensatory hyperhidrosis (CH). Twelve patients with severe and debilitating compensatory hyperhidrosis underwent extended sympathectomy (R5-R8) from September 2016 to May 2019 at the Hospital das Cl√≠nicas, Federal University of Pernambuco, Brazil. Outcomes such as the level of patient satisfaction with the operation, quality of life scores as well as postoperative complications were assessed. There has been a substantial improvement in the quality of life score of 66% of the sample. In all four domains, a statistical significant difference was seen, regarding the relief of compensatory hyperhidrosis symptoms. Extended sympathectomy from R5 to R8 was shown to be quite effective in most cases, leading us to believe that this approach could be a therapeutic option for severe compensatory hyperhidrosis.
