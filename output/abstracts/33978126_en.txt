To analyze the frequency and factors associated with recording deaths due to unspecified external causes in Brazil. This was a cross-sectional study of Mortality Information System data for the year 2017. Univariate logistic regression was used to obtain odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) of nonspecific recording according to the explanatory variables - (hospital deaths and deaths certified by coroners). Brazil registered 159,720 deaths from external causes; 38.9% occurred in hospital, 83.4% were certified by coroners and 21.7% were from unspecified causes. Factors associated with the recording of unspecified external causes were hospital death (OR=2.00 - 95%CI 1.96;2.05) and the coroner's certification (OR=1.08 - 95%CI 1.04;1.11). The frequency of recording unspecified external causes is greater for hospital deaths than for coroner's certification.
