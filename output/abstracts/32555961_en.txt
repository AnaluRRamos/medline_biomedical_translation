To evaluate the differences in the metabonomic profile of patients who achieved remisison of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) after bariatric surgery in relation to those who presented maintenance or recurrence of this condition after surgery. Thirthy-three patients with obesity and T2D were submitted to bariatric/metabolic surgery, among which, 22 experienced complete remission of T2D, and 11 did not experience remission in the postoperative period. Blood samples were taken in order to assess the serum profiles through a 1H NMR-based metabonomic study. The metabonomic model for the assessment of T2D recurrence presented an accuracy of 93.9%, sensibility of 81.8%, specificity of 100%, positive predictive value of 100% and a negative predictive value of 91.7%. bariatric surgery provide specific effects on the distribution of metabolites in those patients who achieved remission of T2DM, and this new distribution can be assessed through a metabonomic model.
