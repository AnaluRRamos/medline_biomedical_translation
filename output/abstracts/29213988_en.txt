Reduction of regional brain glucose metabolism (rBGM) measured by [18F]FDG-PET in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) has been associated with a higher conversion rate from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) is a potential biomarker that has disclosed Naa/mI reductions within the PCC in both MCI and AD. Studies investigating the relationships between the two modalities are scarce. To evaluate differences and possible correlations between the findings of rBGM and NAA/mI in the PCC of individuals with AD, MCI and of cognitively normal volunteers. Patients diagnosed with AD (N=32) or MCI (N=27) and cognitively normal older adults (CG, N=28), were submitted to [18F]FDG-PET and MRS to analyze the PCC. The two methods were compared and possible correlations between the modalities were investigated. The AD group exhibited rBGM reduction in the PCC when compared to the CG but not in the MCI group. MRS revealed lower NAA/mI values in the AD group compared to the CG but not in the MCI group. A positive correlation between rBGM and NAA/mI in the PCC was found. NAA/mI reduction in the PCC differentiated AD patients from control subjects with an area under the ROC curve of 0.70, while [18F]FDG-PET yielded a value of 0.93. rBGM and Naa/mI in the PCC were positively correlated in patients with MCI and AD. [18F]FDG-PET had greater accuracy than MRS for discriminating AD patients from controls.
