Prospectively analyze the effect of preoperative walking status and the patient's surgical education on functional outcomes and the three dimensions of quality of life (QoL) (pain, physical function, and mental health) after elective total knee arthroplasty (TKA). A comparative analysis on the QoL and functional outcomes in patients who underwent total knee arthroplasty between January 2014 and June 2015. To compare effects of the patient's walking status and knowledge of the surgical procedure on QoL and functional outcomes following TKA by means of SF-36 questionnaire, CES D10, VAS, KSS, KSFS, WOMAC, as well as Friedmann and Wyman scores, 10MWT, and 30-second timed chair test, assessed before the operation and one, three, and six months after the operation. There were 168 knees in 154 patients: 46.75% men and 53.24% women. 52.38% of knees had grade-III OA and 40.47% of knees had grade-IV OA. Preoperatively, SF-36 PCS was 33.2 and MCS was 35.4. Mean KSS and KSFS in females was 37.3 (16.2) and 31.5 (13.8); in males it was 49.2 (18.4) and 42.5 (15.7), respectively. Mean WOMAC scores were 64.2 in females and 56.5 in males. Mean VAS and CES D10 scores were 8.8 and 8.2 in females, and 6.9 and 6.4 in males, respectively. Post operatively at the first, third, and sixth month, significant improvements in QoL and mean SF-36, CES D10, VAS, KSS, KSFS, WOMAC, and Friedmann and Wyman scores were observed, as well as in the 10MWT and 30 s timed chair test scores. Patients with better preoperative functional activity and satisfactory understanding of TKA presented a better functional performance and achieved a good quality life (<i>p</i> < 0.01). Surgeons educate TKA candidates regarding the surgical procedure, the nature of implants, and how the procedure would affect their lifestyle and what their expectations from TKA should be. These crucial considerations should boost their confidence, enhancing their involvement and cooperation in post-surgical rehabilitation, thereby improving their QoL, functional results, and post TKA experience. TKA candidates with good preoperative walking ability and understanding of knee arthroplasty have better QoL in early and late post-surgery periods. Patient's lifestyle and understanding significantly enhances the postoperative functional ability.
