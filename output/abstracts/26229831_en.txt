to compare healing strength of the infraspinatus tendon of rats with corticoid inoculation, regarding maximum tension, maximum force and rupture force, after injury and experimental repair. a total of 60 Wistar rats were subjected to tenotomy of the infraspinatus tendon, which was then sutured. Before the surgery, they were divided into a control group (C) inoculated with serum and a study group (S) inoculated with corticoids over the tendon. After repair, the rats were sacrificed in groups of 10 individuals in the control group and 10 in the study group at the times of one week (C1 and S1), three weeks (C3 and S3) and five weeks (C5 and S5). The rats were dissected, separating out the infraspinatus tendon with the humerus. The study specimens were subjected to a traction test, with evaluation of the maximum tension (kgf/cm(2)), maximum force (kgf) and rupture force (kgf), comparing the study group with the respective control groups. among the rats sacrificed one week after the procedure, we observed greater maximum tension in group C1 than in group S1. The variables of maximum force (kgf) and rupture force did not differ statistically between the groups investigated. In the same way, among the rats sacrificed three weeks after the procedure, group C3 only showed greater maximum tension than group S3 (p = 0.007), and the other variables did not present differences. Among the rats sacrificed five weeks after the procedure (C5 and S5), none of the parameters studied presented statistical differences. we concluded that corticoid diminished the resistance to maximum tension in the groups sacrificed one and three weeks after the procedure, in comparison with the respective control groups. The other parameters did not show differences between the study and control groups.
