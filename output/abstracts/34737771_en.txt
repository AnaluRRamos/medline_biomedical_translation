Preeclampsia is one of the leading causes of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality in the world. Calcium supplementation has proven to prevent this disorder. It is therefore important to issue guidelines and recommendations on its use. Synthesize the recommendations regarding preeclampsia developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) with a view to improving the quality of care and outcomes for the health of pregnant women and women of childbearing age in general, and address aspects of their implementation. The guidelines prepared by WHO follow the GRADE method (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) for the preparation of guidelines in the WHO Manual for the Preparation of Directives. Two of the WHO guidelines were synthesized and a systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Lilacs, Health Systems Evidence, Epistemonikos, and gray literature for studies carried out in the Region of the Americas in order to identify barriers, facilitators, and implementation strategies, as well as to determine indicators. Two recommendations related to preeclampsia and eclampsia and their complications were formulated for implementation before and during pregnancy. Implementation barriers and facilitators were identified and indicators were created for assessing adherence and outcomes. The formulated recommendations aim to provide guidance on how to prevent preeclampsia through the consumption of calcium and include suggestions for implementation in Latin America and the Caribbean.
