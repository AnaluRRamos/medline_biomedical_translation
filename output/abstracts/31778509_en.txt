This paper addresses the primary health care crisis of Rio de Janeiro public health system as of 2018. This municipality has experienced a robust primary care expansion since 2009, adopting Social Organizations for recruiting professionals and managing services, qualifying the infrastructure of units and prioritizing family and community medicine, as well as adopting management practices such as standardized offers, evaluation and pay-for-performance compensation, marketing, among others. Given the recent economic crisis, the municipal manager decided to reduce family health teams, considering the current National Policy of Primary Care and arguing that it is possible to optimize resources (doing more with less). In this process, he faced resistance that was not enough to stop him. Due to the resonance of this city (second largest in Brazil and prominent in the national press) and based on public documents and formulations on management, the crisis expressed in the primary health care of this city was debated around the implications of the adoption of Social Organizations in the sustainability of health services, conducting management processes and their rationalities, as well as the political action of social agents advocating for the SUS and primary care in particular.
