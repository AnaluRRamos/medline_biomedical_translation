In the current context of the HIV epidemic, multiple prevention strategies including biomedical interventions have been presented as alternatives for vulnerable groups. This study investigated homosexuals' and bisexuals' perceptions of the risk of HIV infection and their experiences of using HIV post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). We conducted a qualitative study with 25 men who have sex with men (MSM) in five Brazilian cities using semi-structured interviews. The results showed that the use of condoms was the main HIV prevention strategy employed by the respondents. In addition, condom failure, inconsistent condom use and intentional non-use are the main prompters of risk perception and the consequent decision to seek PEP. The respondent's perceptions and meanings of the use of PEP were mediated by prior knowledge of PEP. This work broadens the debate on the more subjective aspects of HIV prevention among MSM, especially those related to risk perception and the decision to use PEP in the context of combined prevention.
