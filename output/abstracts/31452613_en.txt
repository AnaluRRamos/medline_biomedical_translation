To evaluate the functional result of arthroscopic treatment in anterosuperior rotator cuff tears. Fifty-six patients submitted to arthroscopic repair of anterosuperior rotator cuff tears were evaluated. The follow-up time was five year and five months. All the tears were diagnosed by detailed physical and imaging examination. Statistical analysis was used to compare the preoperative and postoperative results of range of motion and the UCLA score, with Wilcoxon signed-rank test, 5% significance level (pâ‰¤0.05), the relationship between the subscapularis tear and postoperative results using the Mann-Whitney test, and between the pain length and the UCLA scale using Spearman's correlation. A statistically significant improvement (p<0.001) was found, comparing the range of motion and the UCLA preoperatively and postoperatively. 39% of the cases were classified as excellent, 33.9% as good, 23.7% as regular and 3.4% as bad results. A statistically significant relationship was found between the subscapularis tear type and the functional state, the pain length and the postoperative UCLA scale. Five complications, four reruptures and one adhesive capsulitis were found. The arthroscopic treatment for anterosuperior tears presented satisfactory results, with 8.5% of complications. <b><i>Level of Evidence IV, Case series.</i></b>
