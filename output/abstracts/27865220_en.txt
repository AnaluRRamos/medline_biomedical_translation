Cervix cancer is the fourth most common female cancer and the second most frequent in women aged 15 to 44 years. The infection by the human papillomavirus is a necessary condition in almost all of cervix cancer cases; it is a sexually transmitted disease and all women sexually active are at risk of being infected. There are currently three vaccines against human papillomavirus, and despite of the efficacy being well proven in woman aged up to 25 years, it is not well established in older ages. It was performed a literature review of the current evidence about the efficacy of the vaccines against human papillomavirus in women older than 24 years in the cervix cancer prevention, and was assessed the evidence quality by the GRADE system. Two randomized controlled trials were identified with a total of 9,571 participants - 4,792 vaccinated and 4,779 at the control group and reported data of 48 months period follow-up. The relative risk reduction was 41% (95% CI: 29 a 50%) - for the vaccinated group. There were no differences in safety and tolerability between the two groups - vaccine and control. The actual evidence shows that the vaccines against human papillomavirus 16 and/or 18 in women older than 24 until 45 years have an important efficacy at reducing the risk of having persistent infection and/or to acquire cervix cancer precursor lesions.
