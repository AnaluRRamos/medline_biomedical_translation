The scope of this study was to determine the satisfaction levels of users of public pharmacies and verify the knowledge of pharmacists in relation to dispensing of medicines. This is a descriptive study, conducted in municipalities in the State of Esp√≠rito Santo, in the period from May to August 2013. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire and SPSS20 software was used for statistical analysis. The Student t or ANOVA test was used for data with normal distribution, while the Mann-Whitney or Kruskal-Wallis test was applied for data without normal distribution. The Spearman correlation was used to evaluate patient satisfaction with the service time and the waiting time. The significance level for the tests was 5%. The main results obtained were the high level of dissatisfaction among users and the correlation with the waiting time to be attended. Apart from this, the knowledge of pharmacists in relation to the medication dispensed was classified as satisfactory/regular. The conclusion drawn is that actions are necessary in the management of pharmaceutical service to address the expectations of users in the dispensation of drugs.
