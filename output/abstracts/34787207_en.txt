This work aimed to identify the prevalence of positive self-perceived health among non-long-lived and long-lived older adults and associated factors. This is a study with older adults in the Family Health Strategy of Montes Claros. The Brazilian Older Americans Resources and Services Multidimensional Function Assessment Questionnaire was used. Bivariate and multiple analyses were performed using Poisson Regression. A total of 1,750 older adults participated in the study, of which 1,420 were non-long-lived older adults, and 330 were long-lived older adults. Positive self-perception was reported among 71.9% of the non-long-lived older adults and 67.8% of the long-lived older adults. Among the non-long-lived, positive self-perceived health was associated with five years of schooling (PR=1.12); household income from two to less than three minimum wages (PR=1.13) and â‰¥three minimum wages (PR=1.12); preserved vision (PR=1.13); proper chewing (PR=1.16); preserved sleep (PR=1.23); absence of polypathologies (PR=1.29); absence of diabetes (PR=1.15); falls in the last year (PR=1.13); and physical activity (PR=1.11). Among the long-lived older adults, it was associated with the use of prosthesis, sleeping disorders, and polypathologies and physical activities. Positive self-perception of health is associated with social and health determinants.
