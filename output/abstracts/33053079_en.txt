To correlate stroke severity with oral intake level of the studied population and compare the two factors at the time of admission and after swallowing management. A total of 137 patients hospitalized in the cerebral vascular accident unit (CVAU) of a teaching hospital participated. During the stay at CVAU, the patients were submitted to daily neurological evaluation and application of National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), to evaluate the severity of stroke, ranging from zero (without evidence of neurological deficit) to 42 (in coma and unresponsive). Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS), which is a marker for evolution of oral intake and ranges from level one (nothing oral) to seven (oral total restrictions). Data from the NIHSS and FOIS scales of admission and discharge were analyzed and compared to verify association between improvement of oropharyngeal dysphagia with functional improvement of individuals. At admission, 63 (46.0%) patients had mild strokes, 38 (27.7%) had severe and very severe stroke; 46 (33.6%) had oral intake and need for special preparation or compensations. At discharge, there was an increase in patients with mild stroke (76 - 55.5%); oral intake without special preparation or compensations, but with food restrictions (18 - 13.1%), and oral intake without restrictions (44 - 32.1%). The level of oral intake increased as the severity of stroke decreased. Speech and language therapy contributed to a decrease in stroke severity and improvement in oral intake.
