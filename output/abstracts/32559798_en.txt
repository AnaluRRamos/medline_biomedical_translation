We examined the interaction of polymorphisms in the genes heme oxygenase-1 (<i>HMOX1</i>) and nitric oxide synthase (<i>NOS3</i>) in patients with preeclampsia (PE) as well as the responsiveness to methyldopa and to total antihypertensive therapy.  The genes <i>HMOX1</i> (rs2071746, A/T) and <i>NOS3</i> (rs1799983, G/T) were genotyped using TaqMan allele discrimination assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA ), and the levels of enzyme heme oxygenase-1 <i>(</i>HO-1) were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).  We found interactions between genotypes of the <i>HMOX-1</i> and <i>NOS3</i> genes and responsiveness to methyldopa and that PE genotyped as AT presents lower levels of protein HO-1 compared with AA.  We found interactions between the <i>HMOX-1</i> and <i>NOS3</i> genes and responsiveness to methyldopa and that the <i>HMOX1</i> polymorphism affects the levels of enzyme HO-1 in responsiveness to methyldopa and to total antihypertensive therapy. These data suggest impact of the combination of these two polymorphisms on antihypertensive responsiveness in PE.
