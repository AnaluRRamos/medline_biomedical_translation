The authors report the case of a 55-year-old female, hypertensive, smoker patient presenting with dysphonia, dysphagia and persistent dry cough. Laryngoscopy diagnosed left vocal cord paralysis. Computed tomography demonstrated saccular aneurysm of the inferior wall of the aortic arch, stretching the left recurrent laryngeal nerve, a finding compatible with Ortner's syndrome.
