to evaluate the degree of implementation of the National Dengue Control Program (PNCD) in two border municipalities in Mato Grosso do Sul State (Corumbá and Ponta Porã), Brazil, 2016. This was a normative evaluation based on indicators of service structure and work process; questionnaires were answered by health professionals involved in dengue prevention and control; the cut-off points used to determine the degree of implementation were 'implemented' (>75% of the activities implemented), 'partially implemented' (50 to 75%), 'low level of implementation' (25 to 49%), and 'not implemented' (<25%). 383 health professionals participated in this study, 227 of whom were from Corumbá and 156 from Ponta Porã; the degree of PNCD implementation was 63.1% and 66.4% for Corumbá and Ponta Porã, respectively, thus being classified as partially implemented in both municipalities. PNCD implementation was partial in both municipalities; problems observed indicate the need for program enhancement.
