To present the results from direct tendon repair using EndoButton and interference screws in patients with lesions of the distal biceps that had evolved over a period of more than 28 days. Between January 2012 and November 2013, eleven patients (all male) with a torn distal biceps and a time interval between injury and surgery of more than 28 days were evaluated. The patients' mean age was 46 years and the most common mechanism of injury was eccentric loading with the elbow flexed and supinated. A subjective analysis on pain and function was conducted using a visual analog scale of pain (VAS) and the Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS), before and after surgery. The VAS showed a decrease of 5 points to 0.8 points on average. The MEPS improved from 69.3 points before the operation to 97.5 points afterwards. The mean flexion was 133.1° on the operated side, versus 134.3°. The mean extension was -2.5° and 0° (operated side versus non-operated). Supination was 88.2° versus 89.5° and pronation was 82.5° versus 84.1°, comparing the operated side versus the non-operated side. Flexion and supination strengths were evaluated with the aid of a dynamometer, and the mean flexion and supination strengths were found to be respectively 78.57% and 89.65% of the strength of the non-operated limb. Use of the technique of direct tendon repair using EndoButton and interference screws was shown to be a safe and effective alternative for repairing chronic lesions of the distal biceps.
