To evaluate the social representations of residents regarding the pedagogical strategies of a Multiprofessional Health Residency program. A case study with a qualitative approach supported by the Theory of Social Representations. Data collection was performed by applying a questionnaire to the resident professionals. ALCESTE software was used for the lexical content analysis. Questionnaires were applied to 15 resident professionals. The analysis showed the educational potential of a Distance Education tool, the need to prioritize theoretical content and its planning, aligning it with the experience in the territory, and the preference of the subjects for dynamic spaces that favor communication and critical-reflective analysis of day-to-day routines. There is a need to value strategies and teaching-learning methodologies that are significant for the resident professional and which contribute to health education.
