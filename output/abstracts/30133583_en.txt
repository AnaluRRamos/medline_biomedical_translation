An analysis is presented of A vida sexual (The sexual life), by Portuguese neurologist Egas Moniz, in which the author divulged medical instructions about the sexed body. Complied in two volumes - 'Physiology' and 'Pathology' - in 1902, it was edited 19 times until it was censored under the Portuguese military dictatorship in 1933. In the work, Moniz devises a discourse of sexual differentiation anchored in an extensive bibliography produced between the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in a context of intense debate about gender roles. Moniz drew on several theories to define sexuality - including eugenics and Freudian theory - to express his idea that 'man is essentially sexual, woman is essentially mother.'
