There are few studies describing the functional changes in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and it is not clear which aspects of functionality are affected by the disease. The aim of the present investigation was to characterize the functional profile of patients previously diagnosed with bvFTD. The sample consisted of 31 patients diagnosed with bvFTD, who were compared to patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n=31) and to healthy control subjects (NC) (n=34), matched for schooling and age. bvFTD and AD patients were matched by severity of dementia. The protocol included the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Direct Assessment of Functional Status (DAFS-BR), Functional Activities Questionnaire (PFAQ), Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD) and the Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR). The group with bvFTD showed worse performance on Initiation and Planning/Organization in the DAD and on ability to feed oneself in the DAFS-BR, as well as higher scores on the PFAQ, suggesting greater dependence in the bvFTD group. The results suggest that individuals with bvFTD display greater functional impairment compared to AD patients with a similar degree of dementia severity and to healthy controls. Direct assessment of functionality proved unable to clearly differentiate between the dementia subtypes.
