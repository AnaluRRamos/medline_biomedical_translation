Right ventricular thrombosis is a rare yet potentially fatal condition. It has been described in association with hypercoagulability states, autoimmune diseases and dilated cardiomyopathy. Echocardiography constitutes the election tool for diagnosis and characterization of these entities, allowing for the differentiation between the various types of thrombi. We present a case of a patient with alcoholic dilated cardiomyopathy admitted for congestive heart failure and lower respiratory infection. In the diagnostic approach, a routine echocardiography revealed a large mural right ventricular thrombus in association with severe biventricular dysfunction. The patient was proposed for anticoagulation strategy, which he refused.
