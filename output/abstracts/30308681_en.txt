Recurrent adnexal torsion is a rare gynecological emergency. We report a case of recurrent ipsilateral adnexal torsion in a woman with polycystic ovaries, previously submitted to a laparoscopic plication of the utero-ovarian ligament. Due to the recurrence after the plication of the utero-ovarian ligament, the authors performed a laparoscopic oophoropexy to the round ligament, which is an underreported procedure. The patient was asymptomatic for 1â€‰year, after which she had a new recurrence and needed a unilateral laparoscopic adnexectomy. Since then, she regained the quality of life without any gynecological symptoms.Oophoropexy to the round ligament may be considered when other techniques fail or, perhaps, as a first option in selected cases of adnexal torsion, as it may allow the prevention of recurrence without increasing morbidity while preserving the adnexa.
