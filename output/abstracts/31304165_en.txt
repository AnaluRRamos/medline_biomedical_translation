to evaluate the results of the arthroscopic treatment of the lateral epicondylitis. we evaluated 14 patients (15 elbows) submitted to the arthroscopic treatment of the lateral epicondylitis refractory to the conservative treatment, which was realized for a minimum period of 18 months. Beyond the demographic data collection, patients were evaluated according to the arthroscopic classification of Baker et al., the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire and the Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS). The patients' ages ranged between 23 and 56 years (average 46 years) (eight males and six females). Of the 15 elbows, 12 were the dominant and one patient had bilateral lesion. The follow-up after surgery was minimum 24 months and maximum 72 months (average 41 months). we found, according to the arthroscopic classification of Baker et al., two patients with type I lesions, nine with type II lesions and three with type III lesions. We found the following complications: one patient with altered sensitivity in the region of the lateral portal, one with a deficit of ten degrees in length, one with synovial plica and one with synovitis in the lateral compartment. Our score on the DASH questionnaire was minimum of 32 points and maximum of 120 points (average 57 points) and the scale of MEPS had a minimum score of 60 points and a maximum of 100 points (average 90 points). the arthroscopic treatment of the lateral epicondylitis, plus insurance, provides satisfactory results.
