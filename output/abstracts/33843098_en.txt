There has been selective pressure to maintain a skin barrier since terrestrial animals evolved 360 million years ago. These animals acquired an unique integumentary system with a keratinized, stratified, squamous epithelium surface barrier. The barrier protects against dehydration and entry of microbes and toxins. The skin barrier centres on the stratum corneum layer of the epidermis and consists of cornified envelopes cemented by the intercorneocyte lipid matrix. Multiple components of the barrier undergo cross-linking by transglutaminase (TGM) enzymes, while keratins provide additional mechanical strength. Cellular tight junctions also are crucial for barrier integrity. The grainyhead-like (GRHL) transcription factors regulate the formation and maintenance of the integument in diverse species. GRHL3 is essential for formation of the skin barrier during embryonic development, whereas GRHL1 maintains the skin barrier postnatally. This is achieved by transactivation of Tgm1 and Tgm5, respectively. In addition to its barrier function, GRHL3 plays key roles in wound repair and as an epidermal tumour suppressor. In its former role, GRHL3 activates the planar cell polarity signalling pathway to mediate wound healing by providing directional migration cues. In squamous epithelium, GRHL3 regulates the balance between proliferation and differentiation, and its loss induces squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). In the skin, this is mediated through increased expression of MIR21, which reduces the expression levels of GRHL3 and its direct target, PTEN, leading to activation of the PI3K-AKT signalling pathway. These data position the GRHL family as master regulators of epidermal homeostasis across a vast gulf of evolutionary history.
