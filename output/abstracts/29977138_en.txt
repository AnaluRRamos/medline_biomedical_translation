To evaluate the prevalence of joint hypermobility in patients undergoing knee surgery to treat traumatic injury to the meniscus and anterior cruciate ligament, and the influence of this hypermobility on postoperative results. This prospective study assessed joint hypermobility in patients who underwent surgical reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), partial meniscectomy, or a procedure combining ACL reconstruction and partial meniscectomy during the period 2011-2015. The Beighton score was used to evaluate joint hypermobility and Tegner activity scale for postoperative assessment. A total of 242 patients underwent surgery during the study period: 107 to treat ACL injuries, 75 to treat ACL injuries associated with meniscus injuries, and 60 to treat meniscus injuries. Of the total, 45 patients had joint hypermobility. We found no association between joint hypermobility and sex or type of injury. Postoperative Tegner scale results were not influenced by the presence of joint hypermobility. No association was found between joint hypermobility and the evaluated variables (gender and type of specific injury), and hypermobility did not have a negative impact on postoperative outcomes. <b>Level of Evidence IV; Case series.</b>
