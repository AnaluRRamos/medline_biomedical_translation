Aging is a demographic phenomenon and an economic, social, political, cultural and ethical issue. The aim of this essay is to reflect on aging and the meaning of old age in the capitalist system, under the paradox that opposes profit and human needs. The investigation carried out indicates that the elderly, with loss of capacities and disabilities, have high rates of public and private negligence. This requires the implementation of specific policies for old age, due to the trend increase of a category of elderly people: the dependent. In general, policies have acted to reinforce the data collected in a survey conducted in 2019, in 6 Brazilian states and the Federal District, among a population of 446,101 elderly people, in which disregard and abuse were found, even with the advances in current Brazilian legislation. Such facts endorse the perception of devaluing images of old age and the fact of being old, making global ethics urgent from the perspective of care that rescues essential democratic values to meaningful old age.
