To evaluate the antitumoral role of γδ T<sub>DC</sub> cells and αβ T<sub>DC</sub> cells in an experimental model of breast cancer.  Thirty female Balb/c mice were divided into 2 groups: control group (<i>n</i> = 15) and induced-4T1 group (<i>n</i> = 15), in which the mice received 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> 4T1 mammary tumor cell line. Following the 28-day experimental period, immune cells were collected from the spleen and analyzed by flow cytometry for comparison of αβ T<sub>DC</sub> (TCRαβ<sup>+</sup> CD11c<sup>+</sup>MHCII<sup>+</sup>) and γδ T<sub>DC</sub> (TCRγδ<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup>MHCII<sup>+</sup>) cells regarding surface markers (CD4<sup>+</sup> and C8<sup>+</sup>) and cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-12 and IL-17).  A total of 26.53% of γδ T<sub>DC</sub> - control group (<i>p</i> < 0.0001) - the proportion of αβ T<sub>DC</sub> was lower in splenic cells than γδ T<sub>DC</sub>; however, these 2 cell types were reduced in tumor conditions (<i>p</i> < 0.0001), and the proportion of IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-12 and IL-17 cytokines produced by γδ T<sub>DC</sub> was higher than those produced by αβ T<sub>DC</sub>, but it decreased under conditions of tumor-related immune system response (<i>p</i> < 0.0001).  Healthy mice engrafted with malignant cells 4T1 breast tumor presented T<sub>DC</sub> with γδ TCR repertoire. These cells express cytotoxic molecules of lymphocytes T, producing anti-tumor proinflammatory cytokines.
