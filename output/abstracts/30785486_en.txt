This article sought to evaluate the conformity between recommendations regarding antidepressant use during breastfeeding found in drug package inserts with recommendations from science-based bibliographic sources. We evaluated the standard drug package inserts of 23 antidepressants with active registration in Brazil. The presence of contraindications of antidepressant use during breastfeeding was compared with information present in the Brazilian Ministry of Health technical manual, the book Medications and Mothers' Milk and on the databases LactMed, Micromedex and UpToDate. In most drug package inserts (62.5%), antidepressants are contraindicated during breastfeeding. Among bibliographical sources, that percentage varied between 0% and 25%. The study shows a low conformity between drug package inserts and bibliographical sources, alerting to the need for revising the content and presentation of information present in antidepressant drug package inserts in Brazil.
