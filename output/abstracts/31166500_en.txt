This research aims to identify the strategies adopted by dwellers of a socially vulnerable community, characterized by social and economic inequality, to address the problems that interfere in the health conditions. A participant investigation anchored in hermeneutics was conducted through participatory diagnosis, with 31 residents of the DendÃª community, who were called vital informants. Data were collected from semi-structured interviews, street walking and focus groups. WebQDA software was adopted to support data analysis, based on content analysis in the thematic modality, which resulted in the following categories: 'individual or small group actions', 'partnerships between residents and social organizations' and 'partnerships with public and private sectors'. We considered that the condition of vulnerability motivated by a diversity of social determinants generates negative impacts on health, requiring planning and implementation of policies and actions geared to people's well-being. This reflects the relevance of the participatory diagnosis, which can be supported by people and Information and Communication Technologies to increase community participation in health promotion actions.
