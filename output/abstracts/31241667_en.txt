This article relates the intelligence testing experiments conducted by Isaías Alves and Noemy Silveira to the broader context of how psychological concepts moved within the Brazilian educational field. Their work acts as a resource to understand how this movement occurred, indicating the different events that helped shape the understanding of this tool. The goal is to show how, even despite their similar initial interests and shared experience at Columbia University, Alves and Silveira did not use the same strategies during their work to apply these tests in schools while they both headed psychology services for the boards of education in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.
