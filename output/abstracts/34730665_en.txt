The goal of this study is to investigate the efferent auditory pathways inhibition in Turner's syndrome and to relate it to the cytogenetic profile. This is a cross-sectional study with a comparison group. A sample with 94 participants divided into two groups: The study group was a sample of 40 patients diagnosed with Turner's syndrome (17.6 years of age). The control group was composed of 54 volunteers (18.9 years of age), female, without syndrome. The selected individuals were submitted to efferent auditory pathways inhibition research. The mean of the inhibitory effect of the efferent auditory pathway in the study group in the right ear was 0.4 dB and in the comparison group it was 1.9 dB, however in the left ear the mean of the inhibitory effect of the efferent auditory pathway was 1.4 dB in the study group and 0.8 dB in the comparison group. The inhibitory effect of the efferent auditory pathway was present in 14 individuals with monosomy and in 15 with other cytogenetic alterations. In the study group, the efferent auditory pathways inhibition value was significantly higher in the left ear and significantly lower than the control group in the right ear. There was no significant difference in efferent auditory pathways inhibition of right ear and left ear between the karyotype types.
