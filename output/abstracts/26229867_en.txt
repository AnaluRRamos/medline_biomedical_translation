To evaluate the concordance among knee surgery specialists regarding the classification and surgical technique indicated in cases of tibial plateau fracture, using conventional radiographs and computed tomography. Forty-four patients with fractures of the tibial plateau shown on radiographic and tomographic images were selected. These were evaluated by specialists at two different times, with an interval of seven days. On the first occasion, the specialists only had access to the radiographs, while on the second occasion they had access to both radiographs and computed tomography images. Their concordance was evaluated by means of the kappa coefficient. The interobserver reliability of the Schatzker classification on the first occasion was 0.36 and on the second occasion, 0.35. This was considered to present low reproducibility. In evaluating the intra-observer reproducibility of this classification, the mean kappa index was 0.42, which was classified as moderate. From evaluating the choice of surgical access, the inter-observer reliability was 0.55 on the first occasion and 0.50 on the second, which was considered to present moderate reproducibility. Evaluation on the implant chosen showed that the interobserver reliability was 0.01 on the first occasion and -0.06 on the second, which was considered to be poor and discordant. In evaluating the classification of the three columns, the inter-observer reproducibility was 0.47 (p < 0.0001), which was classified as moderate concordance. Use of computed tomography did not present any improvement in the inter-observer concordance, using the Schatzker classification, and did not produce any change in the preoperative planning.
