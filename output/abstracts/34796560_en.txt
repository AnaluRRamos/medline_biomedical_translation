The stratum corneum (SC), the outermost layer of the epidermis, serves a crucial role in maintaining body hydration and protection from environmental insults. When the stratum corneum is injured or when the genetic blueprints are flawed, the body is at risk of dehydration, secondary infections and allergen sensitization. Advancements in veterinary dermatology have revealed a wide gamut of disease from relatively benign to lethal that specifically arise from flawed structural proteins, enzymes or lipids needed to create the corneocytes and lipid bilayers of the SC. Some conditions closely mimic their human counterparts while others are unique to the dog. This review will focus on forms of ichthyosis in the dog.
