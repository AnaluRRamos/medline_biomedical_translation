Body composition is relevant for the health and work performance of firefighters. However, the behavior of these parameters has not been elucidated for groups of firefighters performing different tasks. To compare the anthropometric profile of military firefighters who perform administrative (ADM) or operational work . The sample comprised 121 (ADM = 50 and operational = 71) male military firefighters. Body mass (BM), body fat percentage (BFP), fat body mass, lean body mass, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference and somatotype were analyzed. Intergroup difference was found for body mass (ADM = 78.5 kg - operational = 84.6 kg), BMI (ADM = 25.8 - operational = 27.2) and lean body mass (ADM = 61.9 kg - operational = 66.2 kg). The groups exhibited differences in their anthropometric profile and BFP and BMI above the recommended range.
