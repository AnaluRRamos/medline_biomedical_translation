The scope of this study was to conduct a critical analysis of the application of the Brazilian Healthy Eating Index - Revised (BHEI-R), to explain the ease and difficulties in its calculation, to suggest adaptations and to compare its distribution. This was done in accordance with sociodemographic variables among the 15,105 public servants participating in the Longitudinal Study of Adult Health from 2008 to 2010. Food consumption was assessed based on a Food Frequency Questionnaire and BHEI-R was estimated in four ways: original; weighted for frequency of consumption of fruits and vegetables; modified considering legumes separated from other vegetables, and adapted covering the two previous changes. The results indicated that irrespective of the adaptation performed, women, individuals over 65 years of age and individuals with lower schooling had higher mean scores indicating a better quality diet. It is believed that the proposed adaptations may be useful for future studies that apply BHEI-R.
