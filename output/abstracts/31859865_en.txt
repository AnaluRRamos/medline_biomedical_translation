Evidence confirms that the satisfaction perceived by the nursing staff is associated with indicators of the professionals' well-being and quality of the provided services. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate factors associated with reports of job satisfaction. Job satisfaction was assessed based on the validated question: 'Are you satisfied with your work?'. Stratified and proportional random sampling included nurses, nursing aides and technicians from the municipal health network. The multivariate model was based on the Poisson regression technique with robust variances to estimate factors independently associated with job satisfaction. A total of 290 subjects participated: 73.8% of them reported job satisfaction. Age, having strong social support and better working conditions were positively associated with satisfaction. Positive screening for common mental disorders was negatively associated with satisfaction. The emphasis on the work environment and type of management indicates the relevance of these factors for the strengthening of human resources in health.
