to discuss strategic challenges in complex health organizations sustained by an analysis in a Medical Genetics Center at a National Health Research Institute in Brazil. Démarche Stratégique adapted for use with research institutes, including the policy formulation function. The study used institution's databases and workshops with key actors between Dec/2014 and Jun/2015. Were defined the segments: clinical diagnosis, lysosomal diseases, osteogenesis imperfecta, genetic counseling, cytogenetics, biochemistry, and genomics. The findings reveal that the segments are aligned with the Institute's mission when it comes to referral care, although investment is required in strategic areas. The clinical diagnosis, lysosomal diseases, and genomics segments stood out in the scientific output portfolio. The findings show that progress needs to be made with policy implementation and planning to improve access to new technologies, together with investment in training and development, and the strengthening of coordination and collaboration between research institutes and referral services and between the wider healthcare network and research, care, and teaching. The inclusion of the policy formulation dimension was essential to highlight the unique role medical genetics plays in Brazil's public health system and the importance of developing action plans in the field of public health.
