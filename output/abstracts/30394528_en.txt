To examine the prevalence, clinical characteristics, and risk factors of cerebral palsy (CP) in children in Bangladesh. The Bangladesh CP Register is an ongoing population-based surveillance database of children with CP from a geographically defined area in Bangladesh. Cases were defined based on Surveillance of CP in Europe and Australian CP Register criteria after clinical assessments and identification by the key informant's method. In total, 726 children with CP were identified between January 2015 and December 2016. Mean age was 7 years 7 months (standard deviation [SD] 4y 6mo; range: 4.8mo-18y; median 7y 1.2mo; 61.8% male, 38.2% female). Mean age at CP diagnosis was 5 years 2 months (SD 3.8). Observed prevalence was 3.4 per 1000 children (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.2-3.7), resulting in an estimated 233 514 children (95% CI: 219 778-254 118) with CP in Bangladesh. The majority (79.6%) had spastic CP. Altogether, 79.6% of the children with CP had at least one associated impairment (speech 67.6%, intellectual 39.0%, epilepsy 23.7%, visual 10.2%, and hearing 10.2%). In total, 78.2% never received rehabilitation. In Bangladesh, the burden of CP is high, and diagnosis is substantially delayed, limiting opportunities for early intervention. There is a lack of available services and the majority of the children had preventable risk factors. Prevalence of cerebral palsy (CP) is 3.4 per 1000 children in rural Bangladesh. There are an estimated 233 514 children with CP in Bangladesh. The majority have potentially preventable risk factors. Diagnosis of CP is delayed, limiting opportunities for early intervention. There is a lack of available services for children with CP in rural Bangladesh.
