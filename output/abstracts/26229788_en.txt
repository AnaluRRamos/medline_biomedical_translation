to functionally evaluate patients with injury of the distal insertion of the biceps brachii muscle that was treated surgically. between April 2002 and June 2011, 15 elbows of 14 patients underwent surgical treatment performed by the Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Group, Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology, School of Medical Sciences, Santa Casa de SÃ£o Paulo. The minimum follow-up was six months, with a mean of 28 months. The patients' ages ranged from 28 to 62 years, with a mean age of 40 years. All the patients were male and the dominant arm was affected in 64.2%. The clinical evaluation on the results was conducted using the criteria of the American Medical Association (AMA), as modified by Bruce, with evaluation of the joint range of motion (flexion-extension and pronosupination), the presence of pain and the patient's degree of satisfaction. from the AMA criteria, as modified by Bruce, we obtained 100% satisfactory results, of which 85.7% were considered to be excellent and 14.3% good. We observed that when distal injuries of the biceps brachii muscle affected young and active patients, surgical treatment was a good option.
