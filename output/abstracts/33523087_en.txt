Pain control is essential in dental practice, and can be accomplished through various techniques. This study seeks to compare atraumatic and conventional anesthetic techniques, applied during surgeries to remove upper third molars. The endpoints evaluated were pain indices, patient satisfaction and anesthetic efficacy. A random parallel split-mouth clinical trial was conducted with 14 patients. Group A received atraumatic anesthesia without a needle (Comfort-in®) and group B received conventional anesthesia by blocking the posterior superior alveolar nerve (PSAN) and Greater Palatine Nerve (GPN). A Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was used to assess pain. A significantly (p<0.001) lower perception of pain was observed among individuals who received the atraumatic technique. In 71% of cases, it was necessary to supplement the anesthesia during the procedure. Even considering the need for additional anesthesia, the Comfort-in® technique was more accepted by patients with regard to pain perception than the conventional manual technique.
