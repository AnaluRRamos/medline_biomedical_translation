We aimed to determine the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of unplanned extubation among adult patients. We conducted a prospective cohort study of adult intubated patients admitted to the charity wards of a government tertiary teaching hospital in the Philippines. Patients managed in both intensive care and nonintensive care settings were included. Patients were followed-up until discharge or until seven days postextubation. The outcomes of the 191 included patients were planned extubation (35%), unplanned extubation (19%), death (39%), and discharge against advice (7%). Competing risk regression showed that male sex (Crude OR: 2.25, 95%CI: 1.10 - 4.63) and age (Crude OR 0.976, 95%CI: 0.957 - 0.996) were significant baseline factors. The night shift (Crude OR: 24.6, 95%CI: 2.87 - 211) was also consistently associated with more unplanned extubations. Among postextubation outcomes, reintubation (unplanned extubation: 61.1% versus planned extubation: 25.4%), acute respiratory failure (unplanned extubation: 38.9% versus planned extubation: 17.5%), and cardiovascular events (unplanned extubation: 8.33% versus planned extubation: 1.49%) occurred significantly more often among the unplanned extubation patients. Admission in an intensive care unit was not associated with a lower risk of unplanned extubation (Crude OR 1.15, 95%CI: 0.594 - 2.21). Many intubated patients had unplanned extubation. Patients admitted in nonintensive care unit settings did not have significantly higher odds of unplanned extubation.
