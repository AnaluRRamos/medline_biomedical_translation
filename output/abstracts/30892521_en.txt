This study sought to evaluate the associations between health conditions and sociodemographic characteristics in relation to quality of life (QoL) in the Brazilian population; as well as to assess the main factors associated with higher chances of a better QoL among diabetics. This is a study with data from a population-based survey conducted in Brazil in 2008. A total of 12,423 Brazilians aged ≥ 20 years were analyzed, of which 935 were diabetic. QoL outcomes were measured using the summary components of the SF-36 instrument. QoL scores were classified as 'above' and 'below average' to obtain binary outcomes both for the general population and diabetics. Logistic regressions were performed to obtain prevalence ratios adjusted to the odds of above average QoL by adjusting for sociodemographic and health variables. Results indicate that female diabetics aged ≥ 65 years old, with a sedentary lifestyle, belonging to D/E social class and with more morbidities had greater chances of a worse physical and mental QoL. Regarding the general population, in addition to these factors, not having a partner and being illiterate were also responsible for worse QoL. Sedentary lifestyle and D/E social class had greater influence for worse QoL among diabetics when compared to the general population.
