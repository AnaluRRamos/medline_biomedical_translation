To report the experience of implementing Home Visits as part of the Young Mothers Caregiver Program. The program focuses on the mother-child relationship as an object of care for developing parenting using the attachment theory, the self-efficacy theory and the bioecological theory as references. The construction of this program was centered on materials of international visitation programs, based on the translation of the material, elaboration and validation of the theoretical content. The home visits performed by the nurses lasted an average of 1 hour, where issues related to health care, environmental health, life project, parenting, family and social network, in addition to the adolescents' demands were discussed. It was shown that nurses encountered difficulties in implementing the program. By adopting Home Visits as a care tool with a focus on parenting, the experience of implementing the program proved to be an innovative technology, with great potential and relevance for promoting adolescent care and child development.
