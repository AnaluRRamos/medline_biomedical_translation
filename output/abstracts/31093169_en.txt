Evaluate the implementation and operation of protected residences for people with serious mental illness in Iquitos, based on the benefits and perceived improvement in their quality of life. Qualitative and cross-cutting study. Thirty-six in-depth interviews of residents, caregivers, neighbors, and health professionals were conducted. A sociodemographic and clinical file was completed for each resident, along with a file on managerial processes for each facility. Focus groups were conducted with managers and caregivers. Residents' previous length of stay in a psychiatric hospital was 7 years and 3 months. Only 28 % had suffered a clinical relapse in the past year. Residents reported an improvement in their quality of life and greater satisfaction with their stay in the facility compared with their stay in the psychiatric hospital. The residences evaluated are located in areas accessible to social and community services, with adequate access to transportation. Periodic supervision of caregivers, infrastructure, and residence maintenance was performed. Caregivers, managers, residents, and neighbors have a positive view of residence operations.
