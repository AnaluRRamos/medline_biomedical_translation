The long-term effects of allergen specific immunotherapy (ASIT) on concentrations of circulating immunoglobulin E (IgE) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) in horses have not been reported. To document changes in clinical severity of horses with atopic dermatitis (AD) and to monitor allergen-specific IgE and IgG concentrations during a two-year course of ASIT. Nineteen client-owned horses with a conditional diagnosis of AD. Three ASIT groups were randomly assigned based upon results obtained by either intradermal testing (IDT) for regional allergens (n = 7); enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for specific IgE (n = 6); or a composite of results from both tests (n = 6). Serum concentrations of IgE and IgG specific for allergens included in ASIT were measured at time zero and at four-month intervals. A visual analog scale (VAS) was used to record severity of clinical signs at times zero, 12 and 24 months. Positive correlations were documented between IgE and both immediate and delayed IDT results (P < 0.00001), and between immediate IDT and IgG results (P = 0.003). Specific IgE in sera decreased significantly (P < 0.05) for allergens that were included in ASIT, whereas IgG increased. Across all horses, the mean VAS score decreased by 1.2 units [95% CI: 1.28, 1.14; (P < 0.0001)] during each 12-month period of ASIT therapy. Improvement in clinical signs was noted in 76.5% of the horses following 12 months of ASIT and in 82% after 24 months on ASIT. In this pilot study, ASIT in horses with AD provided significant clinical benefit associated with a concomitant reduction of allergen-specific IgE and elevation of IgG.
