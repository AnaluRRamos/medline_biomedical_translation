To evaluate the risk of developing perioperative lesions due to surgical positioning in patients submitted to elective surgeries. This is an analytical and longitudinal study carried out with 45 patients in a public hospital of medium and high complexity in the state of Piauí. The following data was used: perioperative evaluation instrument, Numerical Visual Scale, Braden Scale and the Risk Assessment Scale for the Development of Injuries from Surgical Positioning (ELPO). Participants aged ≥ 46 years had a higher risk, and there were 33.4% of hypertensives among the 35.6% with comorbidities. The most prevalent position, with 64.5% was supine, with only 2.2% cases of pre-surgical injury. Regarding the risk for positional lesions, 68.9% presented low risk. 31.1% of the participants were at high risk for developing positional lesions, related to age and comorbidities.
