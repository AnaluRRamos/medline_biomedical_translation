This article aims to identify the factors associated with musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) in the neck/shoulder and distal upper limb in artisanal fisher/shellfish gatherers in Saubara, Bahia, Brazil. This cross-sectional epidemiological study was conducted with shellfish gatherers. The Brazilian version of the Job Content Questionnaire (JCQ), the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (NMQ), and a questionnaire containing physical demands adapted to the labour of shellfish gatherers were used in this study. Factor analysis was performed to aggregate the physical demands. Multivariate analyses were performed according to the risk factors for MSDs in the neck or shoulder and MSDs in the distal upper limb. For MSDs in the neck or shoulders, a prevalence ratio (PR) of 1.28 (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.09-1.49) was found, according to the aggregate physical demands. For MSDs in the distal upper limb, the PRs were as follows: 1.26 (95% CI: 1.07-1.47) according to the daily hours devoted to work as shellfish gatherers, 0.74 (95% CI: 0.57-0.96) according to the development of other current work and 1.38 (95% CI: 1.05-1.83) according to the aggregate physical demands. The activities performed by shellfish gatherers contribute to the occurrence of MSDs.
