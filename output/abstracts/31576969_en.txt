To analyze the adequacy of prenatal care in a Birth Center and the causes associated with maternal and newborn transfers to the hospital. Cross-sectional study of the care provided at the only Birth Center in Rio de Janeiro, from 2009 to 2014. Statistical analyzes were based on the Ï‡2 test and Prevalence Ratio (PR). Suitable prenatal care was predominant (42.8%) and there was no association (p = 0.55) with the transfers. Maternal transfer is caused by the ruptured amniotic sac (PR = 2.09, 95% CI 1.62-2.70) and altered fetal heart rates (PR = 3.06, 95% CI, 2.13-4.39). Newborn transfers are associated with the presence of meconium in the amniotic fluid (PR = 2.40, 95% CI 1.30-4.43); Apgar below 7 (PR = 5.33, 95% CI 2.65-10.73); and ventilatory assistance at birth (PR = 9.41, 95% CI 5.52-16.04). Complications during intrapartum care are the causes associated with transfers.
