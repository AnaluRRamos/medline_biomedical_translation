Feline atopic syndrome (FAS) is a common disease. Single intradermal injections of heat-killed actinomycetales have shown beneficial effects in canine allergies. To evaluate the clinical effects of heat-killed actinomycetales [Gordonia bronchialis (GB) and Rodococcus coprophilus (RC)], alone or in combination, in FAS. Privately owned cats with a diagnosis of FAS were assigned randomly in three treatment groups (GB, RC and GB/RC combination) or placebo. Five intradermal injections were performed over a one year period. At each visit [Day (D)0, D20, D40, D60, D90, D180 and D365], clinical signs, global owner assessment score, use of rescue medications, clinical adverse effects, skin hydration and cutaneous pH were assessed. Seventeen cats were enrolled. When compared to the placebo group and improvement in treatment GB was sustained from D90. When compared with D0 significant improvement in the GB group was seen from D60. Over one year, a complete remission of the clinical signs was seen in 30-67% of cats in the treatment groups. A reduction in the pruritus score was seen for RC after 365 days of treatment (P = 0.04). Differences in the other variables were not seen. The use of multiple intradermal injections of heat-killed GB shows promise as effective and well-tolerated treatment for FAS. Because of the low cost and the lack of adverse effects, GB could be a beneficial treatment option for FAS. A larger study is needed to confirm these data and to evaluate the immunological changes occurring in the treated cats.
