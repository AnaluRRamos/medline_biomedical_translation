Chronic Back Problem (CBP) is a public health concern. In Brazil, data from the National Health Survey (PNS) estimated 27.0 million people (18.5%) who reported CBP, affecting more women than men. This study aims to identify the factors associated with CBP among women of childbearing age. It is a cross-sectional study carried out with data from the PNS, where the dependent variable was the prevalence of CBP, and associated factors included socio-demographic items, life habits, reproductive history, nutritional status, diagnosis of depression and health perception. A total of 22,621 women aged 18 to 49 years were interviewed. Of these, 14.8% reported having CBP. The risk factors studied were: increased age; living with spouse; multiparity; smoking; overweight or obese, having Waist Circumference (WC) above 80cm and Circumference/Height (C/E) index above 0.5; negative self-perception of health; and depression. The only protective factor associated with CBP risk reduction was education level. We conclude that age, living with a spouse/partner, smoking, multiparity, being overweight or obese, increased risk for cardiovascular diseases, depression and negative self-perceived health are associated with the development of CBP in women of childbearing age.
