The use of speckle-tracking echocardiography for evaluation of cardiac function has great applicability in different scenarios. The broad use of this method requires tools that allow the extraction of relevant data from strain curves and inclusion of these data in traditionally used parameters. The present study aimed to present and validate a free software, called D-station, for analysis of strain curves. From raw data files, the D-Station determines the phases of the cardiac cycle, and simultaneously exhibits the strain and strain rate curves of different cardiac chambers. Validation of the software was done by global longitudinal strain (GLS), and the analyses were performed: 1) graphical comparison of EchoPAC and D-Station paired measurements in relation to equality line; 2) by coefficient of correlation of these measurements; 3) test of hypothesis (p > 0.05); and 4) Bland-Altman analysis. The Spearman’s rho correlation coefficient indicated a strong correlation between the measurements. Results of the test of hypothesis showed a p-value = 0.6798 >> 0.05, thus also indicating an equivalence between the softwares. The Bland-Altman analysis revealed a bias ≤ 1% and dispersion ≤ 2% between the measurements. The tests showed that, for GLS values lower than 10%, there was a trend for higher percentage difference between the values, although the absolute values remained low. The D-Station software was validated as an additional tool to the EchoPAC, which uses the raw data from the strain and strain rate curves exported from a proprietary software.
