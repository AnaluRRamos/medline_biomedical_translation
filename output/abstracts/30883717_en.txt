To determine the level of evidence on the effectiveness of health coaching for parents of children with disabilities. A systematic review approach, comprised of a comprehensive, librarian-guided literature search; transparent study selection and data extraction; quality assessment; and synthesis of sufficiently similar data (per population, intervention nature, and overall level of evidence for each outcome using standard definitions) was undertaken. Twenty-eight studies (13 randomized clinical trials) were included. Three health coaching approaches were identified: child-targeted (most commonly applied), parent-targeted, and a mixed approach. Overall, there is an insufficient-to-limited level of evidence regarding the effectiveness of these approaches. High-quality clinical trials using the parent-targeted coaching approach are warranted. Health coaching parents of children with disabilities is an emergent practice. Child-targeted, parent-targeted, or mixed health coaching approaches exist. The child-targeted health coaching approach is currently most applied. Parents of children with autism spectrum disorder are the most common recipients.
