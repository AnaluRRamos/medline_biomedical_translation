To analyze association between social position and access to health services. This was a cross-sectional study carried out in primary health care centers in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil, where a project for improving accessibility was implemented. Pearson's chi-square test and logistic regression were used. 467 users took part in the study, 75.6% had not finished high school; 78.7% had <2 minimum wages; 51.8% had intermediate/qualified occupations. Low income was associated with starting to queue at the health care center the night before or before 8 a.m. (odds ratio = 2.09 - 95%CI 1.13;3.87) and spending more time scheduling an appointment (odds ratio = 2.13 - 95%CI 1.05;4.31). Having an elementary occupation was associated with face-to-face appointment scheduling (odds ratio = 1.68 - 95%CI 1.14;2.45). Education and social trajectory showed no significant association with use of health services. Social inequalities in access to health services remained after the intervention to improve accessibility.
