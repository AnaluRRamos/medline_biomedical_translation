Juxtaglomerular tumours are rare causes of secondary hypertension. They typically present with difficult-to-manage hypertension, hypokalemia, hyperreninemia and secondary hyperaldosteronism. The authors describe a clinical case of a 45 years old female patient, with personal history of difficult-to-manage hypertension and hypokalemia since age 35, medicated with four types of anti-hypertensive agents. An analytical study was performed, which revealed secondary hyperaldosteronism [aldosterone 44.3 ng/dL (4 - 28 ng/dL), renin > 1000 mIU/mL (4.4 - 46.2 mIU/mL)]. Abdominal computed tomography scan identified a heterogeneous nodule located in the middle third of the right kidney, with 3.7 cm. Partial nephrectomy was performed and histological analysis confirmed the diagnosis of reninoma. After surgery, the patient had normal levels of aldosterone (9.2 ng/dL) and renin (1.20 mIU/mL), as well as normal blood pressure. The authors want to highlight this potentially curable cause of endocrine hypertension. Surgical resection is the treatment of choice and leads to normalization of blood pressure.
