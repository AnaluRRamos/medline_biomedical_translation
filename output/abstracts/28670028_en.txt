To compare intraoperative measurements of the knee with those obtained by magnetic resonance imaging, in order to validate the latter method for use in anthropometric studies. We studied 20 knees in 20 patients with osteoarthritis, all of whom underwent total arthroplasty between August and December of 2013. We took six measurements in the distal femur and two in the proximal tibia. Using the information system of the institution, we made the measurements on magnetic resonance imaging scans that had been obtained in the axial plane. Intraoperative measurements were obtained using a caliper, after the initial cuts made during the arthroplasty. The anatomical parameters determined by magnetic resonance imaging were the same as those determined by intraoperative measurement. The intraclass correlation coefficient was used in order to assess the level of agreement in anthropometric measurements of the knee performed by magnetic resonance imaging and by intraoperative measurement. Statistical analysis revealed a highly significant correlation between the knee anthropometric parameters of the knee determined by intraoperative measurement and those determined by magnetic resonance imaging. The dimensions of osteoarthritic knees measured by magnetic resonance imaging were similar to those measured intraoperatively. Therefore, magnetic resonance imaging can be considered a reliable method for use in large-scale anthropometric studies that will allow the available implants to be adapted and improved.
