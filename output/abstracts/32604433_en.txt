The Robson 10 group classification system (RTGCS) is a reproducible, clinically relevant and prospective classification system proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a global standard for assessing, monitoring and comparing cesarean section (CS) rates. The purpose of the present study is to analyze CS rates according to the RTGCS over a 3-year period and to identify the main contributors to this rate.  We reviewed data regarding deliveries performed from 2014 up to 2016 in a tertiary hospital in Portugal, and classified all women according to the RTGCS. We analyzed the CS rate in each group.  We included data from 6,369 deliveries. Groups 1 (<i>n</i> = 1,703), 2 (<i>n</i> = 1,229) and 3 (<i>n</i> = 1,382) represented 67.7% of the obstetric population. The global CS rate was 25% (<i>n</i> = 1,594). Groups 1, 2, 5 and 10 were responsible for 74.2% of global CS deliveries.  As expected, Groups 1, 2, 5 and 10 were the greatest contributors to the overall CS rate. An attempt to increase the number of vaginal deliveries in these groups, especially in Groups 2 and 5, might contribute to the reduction of the CS rate.
