Human papillomavirus infection is the most common sexual transmitted infection in the world, being associated with different diseases, namely anogenital warts, recurrent respiratory papillomatosis and anal, cervical, and oropharyngeal cancers. Among sexually active people, approximately 1% has anogenital warts, 90% of cases resulting from genotypes 6 and 11. Patients diagnosed with first episode of anogenital warts from 2008 to 2014 in Lisbon's major venereology clinic were identified, and characterized according to sex, sexual orientation, age, warts location, and number of sexual partners. We observed a statistically significant decrease in first anogenital warts diagnosis among < 19 year old females (r = -0.848;p = 0.016) and a non-statistically significant decrease among < 19 ' year-old males and among 20 ' 24 year old females. In October 2008, the quadrivalent vaccine (genotypes 6, 11, 16, 18) was introduced in the Portuguese national vaccination program, targeting 13-year-old females, with a catch-up for 17 year old females. In the women'Â´s group, decrease in first anogenital warts diagnosis is probably related to human papillomavirus vaccination before onset of sexual activity. This study reinforces the importance of national human papillomavirus vaccination program.
