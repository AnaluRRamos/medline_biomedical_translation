To investigate, through a systematic review, how three assessment instruments for children's vocabulary (Test of Childhood language ABFW, Expressive Vocabulary Test - EVT, and Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test - PPVT) have been used in Brazilian research, verifying its purposes of uses and the main results of the researches. This review was organized in three studies. Study 1 referred to the process of a priori search and Study 2 referred to the a posteriori search. We searched for three Brazilian's database (CAPES, SciELO, and PePSIC). For Study 1, we selected empirical studies containing research data with one of the three-targeted tests, using typically developing school children (7 to 10 years old). For Study 2, we enlarged the age range for pre-school and extended the search to non-typically developing children. The selected articles were fully read and synthesized in a table containing the study's aims, the age range of the sample, instrument, research design, main results, and journal. We found out 24 articles, most of which from the speech-language therapy area. The results indicated the predominance of cross-sectional and observational studies, aiming to delineate the cognitive profile of children with some developmental disturbance, with or without control groups. None of the researches conducted a psychometric inquiry of the instruments. In Brazil, it is necessary to carry out research focusing on the psychometric inquiry of instruments for evaluating the vocabulary in pre-school and school-age children.
