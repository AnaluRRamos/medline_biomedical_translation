The liver transplant program in our center started in 1992, and post-liver transplant patients are still admitted to the intensive care unit. For the intensive care physician, a learning curve started then, skills were acquired, and a specific practice was established. Throughout this time, several concepts changed, improving the care of these patients. The practical approach varies between liver transplant centers, according to local specificities. Hence, we wanted to present our routine practice to stimulate the debate between dedicated teams, which can allow the introduction of new ideas and potentially improve each local standard of care.
