This paper aims to identify the effects of maternal morbidities on the nutritional composition of human milk. This systematic review of the literature employed a PRISMA's protocol for searching, selecting, and extracting data. The flowchart proposed for bibliographic search resulted in 1,582 papers, of which 14 were selected for this work. The papers selected for this review were published between 1987 and 2016. Nine studies found significant differences in the nutritional composition of the milk of mothers with diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, or overweight compared to the control group. Most studies have shown that the presence of chronic diseases leads to changes in the nutritional composition of human milk. The main results showed a lower concentration of lactose and fat in the milk of women with diabetes mellitus. Concerning hypertension, higher levels of total protein were found in colostrum and mature milk. A higher fat and energy content was observed in overweight mothers. It is imperative that these women have continuous nutritional monitoring to minimize the impact of these morbidities on the nutritional composition of breast milk.
