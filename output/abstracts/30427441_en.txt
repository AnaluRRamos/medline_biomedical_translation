The use of health indicators is indispensable for understanding the complex relationship between the environmental and health fields. For the proposition of environmental health indicators, the Brazilian Ministry of Health (MH) recommends using a model proposed by the World Health Organization. This model is composed of the following elements: Driving Force, Pressure, State, Exposure, Effect, and Action; it is called the DPSEEA model. The objective of this study is to propose the application of this model in healthcare waste (HCW) management. This study was performed by documentary research using two data sources: a) technical reports on research on HCW from the last 15 years (outpatient, dental, hospital, veterinary, university, and primary care unit) at the University of Caxias do Sul, Brazil; and b) the MH manual entitled 'Environmental Health: Basic Guide for the Construction of Indicators'. The results show that the model is relevant because it makes it possible to analyse a particular context, proposing indicators and defining specific actions for the case of this study, to monitor and improve methods of managing HCW. The results also show that the proposed model is an important analytical tool for both medical waste management and planning actions that will minimize risks, particularly chemical and biological, resulting in environmental health and protection.
