to assess the physicians' knowledge regarding intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome and to compare it with the established literature. we conducted a descriptive, observational, cross-sectional, quantitative study. We interviewed 38 physicians through a self-administered questionnaire composed of objective questions. We carried out the study in a tertiary reference university hospital, located in Curitiba, Paran√°. the mean age of the participants was 28 years, 60.5% were female and the mean time of medical experience was 3.5 years. Regarding the knowledge on the subject, 57.9% considered that abdominal compartment syndrome starts with intra-abdominal grade III hypertension, 50% considered abdominal perfusion pressure the most reliable method to determine intra-abdominal hypertension, 89.4% considered the intravesical measuring technique as the most used, 71.1% considered oliguria to be the early sign of abdominal compartment syndrome. Of the interviewees, 81.6% did not measure intra-abdominal pressure because there was no protocol defined by the service. Seventy-nine percent of respondents said they did not know the definitions of the consensus of the World Society of the Abdominal Compartment Syndrome (WSACS). half of the physicians were able to classify intra-abdominal hypertension and indicate the onset of abdominal compartment syndrome correctly.
