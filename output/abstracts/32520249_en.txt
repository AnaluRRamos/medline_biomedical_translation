This study aimed to evaluate the quality of life of elderly living with HIV in Recife (PE), Brazil. This is a descriptive, quantitative cross-sectional study with convenience and random sample of 241 subjects. The HIV/AIDS Target Quality of Life (HAT-QoL) instrument was applied. The quality of life was compromised in the areas of confidentiality (51.89), sexual function (63) and financial concerns (64.74). The best scores were medication concerns (87.91), health concerns (86.80), and HIV acceptance (82.78). Men scored for a better quality of life in all realms. We can conclude that among the factors associated with better quality of life in men are schooling, financial situation, self-perception and HIV-related stigma, which seems to be stronger compared with women.
