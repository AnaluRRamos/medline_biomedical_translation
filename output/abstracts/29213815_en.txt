Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of presenile dementia. Three main clinical variants are widely recognized within the FTLD spectrum: the behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), semantic dementia (SD) and progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA). FTLD represents a highly heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders which are best classified according to the main protein component of pathological neuronal and glial inclusions. The most common pathological class of FTLD is associated with the TDP-43 protein (FTLD-TDP), while FTLD-Tau is considered slightly less common while the FTLD-FUS (Fused in sarcoma protein) pathology is rare. In this review, these three major pathological types of FTLD are discussed.
