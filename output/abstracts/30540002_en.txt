This study aimed to analyze the financial investment used for the procurement of food for the Brazilian National School Food Program (PNAE) in a city in the South of Brazil. The bidding process, the public calls and accountability reports of the PNAE were analyzed in the following variables: I) municipal financial complementation values; II) percentage of resources used to purchase foods from Family Farmer (FF), and Recommended, Restricted, Prohibited and others foods. The comparison of proportions was employed as a test to identify differences between investments. The municipal financial complementation was 65% of the total. The total amount used to purchase foods was distributed as follows: 65.5% for the Recommended, 27.9% for the Restricted, 6.5% for the Other and 0% for the Prohibited. The expenditure on Recommended foods was higher (p < 0.001) compared to the remaining groups. FF provided only Recommended foods, representing 12.1% of total (municipality and federal) expenditure and 29.5% of total federal funds. The direct purchase from FF contributed to the purchase of recommended foods. The municipal financial complementation was not geared to FA, which can compromise the potential of the school food program to promote healthy and sustainable food systems.
