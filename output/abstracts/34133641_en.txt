To describe agreement between the Juarez System immunization data and information in vaccination record booklets and vaccination coverage in children aged 12 to 24 months. This was a descriptive study to assess the vaccination status at 12 and 24 months of age of children born in 2015 and recorded on the Juarez System. The levels of agreement between the Juarez System data and the information in vaccination record booklets were verified. 429 children were included. It was found that agreement ranged between 84.1% and 99.1%. The vaccine survey found that coverage for each vaccine ranged from 86.01% to 100% and for the full schedule, from 77.1% (12 months) to 68.8% (24 months). The spatial distributions of vaccine coverage ranged from 28% to 100%. There was excellent agreement between the data, with high vaccination coverage, but heterogeneity in their spatial distributions.
