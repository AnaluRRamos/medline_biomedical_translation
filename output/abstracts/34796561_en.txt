Staphylococcus pseudintermedius is the main aetiological agent of canine pyoderma. Whole genome sequencing is the most comprehensive way of obtaining relevant genomic information about micro-organisms. Oxford Nanopore technology enables quality sequencing and de novo assembly of the whole genome of S. pseudintermedius. Whole genome analysis of S. pseudintermedius may help to better understand the pathogenesis of canine pyodermas. Twenty-two strains of S. pseudintermedius isolated from the skin of five healthy dogs and 33 strains isolated from skin of 33 dogs with pyoderma were analysed. DNA was extracted and sequenced using Oxford Nanopore MinION, a new technology that delivers longer reads in a hand-held device. The pangenome was analysed and visualised with Anvi'o 6.1. Nanopore technology allowed the sequencing and de novo assembly of the genomes of 55 S. pseudintermedius strains isolated from healthy dogs and from dogs with pyoderma. The average genome size of S. pseudintermedius was 2.62 Mbp, with 48% being core genome. Pyoderma isolates contained a higher number of antimicrobial resistance genes, yet the total number of virulence factors genes did not change between isolates from healthy dogs and from dogs with pyoderma. Genomes of meticillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius (MRSP) strains were larger than those of meticillin-susceptible (MSSP) strains (2.80 Mbp versus 2.59 Mbp), as a consequence of a greater presence of antimicrobial resistance genes, phages and prophages. This technique allows much more precise and easier characterisation of canine S. pseudintermedius populations and may lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of canine pyodermas.
