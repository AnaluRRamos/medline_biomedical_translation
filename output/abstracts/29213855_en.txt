Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (anti-NMDA-R) encephalitis is the second-most-common cause of autoimmune encephalitis, based on epidemiological studies.It has been predominantly described in young females, with prominent psychiatric symptoms, memory loss, decrease in level of consciousness, epilepsy, and central hypoventilation. The condition is commonly associated with mature ovarian teratomas. We describe a video report with a classic presentation of anti-NMDA-R encephalitis in a young patient with no identifiable tumor. Anti-NMDA encephalitis is a recognizable and treatable illness. The prognosis of patients depends on early diagnosis, implementation of appropriate immunomodulatory therapy and, in paraneoplastic cases, complete tumor removal. Clinicians should be wary of this condition, especially when assessing patients with recent onset of psychiatric symptoms unresponsive to antipsychotic treatment.
