Since the coronavirus pandemic set in in Spain in March 2020, a noteworthy increase in the incidence of acute limb ischemia (ALI) has been observed. It has been recently discovered that SARS-CoV 2 may lead to ALI secondary to arterial thrombosis. Elevation of D-dimer (DD) in patients with coronavirus infection (COVID-19) indicates that a hypercoagulable state causes acute arterial thrombosis. A remarkably high DD elevation has been reported to be a poor prognosis factor in COVID-19. The ways in which SARS-CoV 2 results in arterial thrombosis may be multiple. On the other hand, surgical revascularization for ALI is associated with poor outcomes in COVID-19 patients, probably in relation to hypercoagulability. Here, we describe two ALI cases in patients who required urgent surgical treatment for limb salvage and were positive for the novel coronavirus infection (COVID 19).
