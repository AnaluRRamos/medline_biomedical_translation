Dermatological conditions are common in English bulldogs (EBs). This cross-sectional study describes the dermatological health status of a group of EBs and compares the results with owner perceptions and its possible impact on quality of life (QoL). Computed tomographic (CT) findings of the ear canals were compared between EBs and mesaticephalic dogs. Twenty-seven EBs participating in a health study in Finland. A QoL questionnaire was completed for EBs with owner-reported clinical signs referable to the skin or ear. Clinical evaluation included recording the Canine Atopic Dermatitis Extent and Severity Index, the Otitis Index Score, false paw pad grading and the presence of interdigital furunculosis. These were summed to form a total clinical score (TCS). The cross-sectional surface areas of the horizontal ear canals were measured from CT images and compared with respective images of 14 mesaticephalic dogs collected from a patient database. All 27 EBs had abnormal findings on dermatological examination, but 37% of the owners had not recognized skin or ear signs. The median QoL score was 5.0 (range 0-12) and correlated with TCS (correlation coefficient = 0.507, P < 0.05). English bulldogs had narrower horizontal ear canals than mesaticephalic dogs (P < 0.001). All EBs had abnormal dermatological findings that were unnoticed or considered to be of minor significance to the QoL by most owners. Narrow ear canals were common, possibly related to the brachycephalic conformation of the breed.
