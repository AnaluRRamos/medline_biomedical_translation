To analyze the self-assessment of communication resources used by sales representatives and its relation with their sales performance. The study counted with 55 sales representatives, 46 men and 9 women, between 24 and 56 years old. In the first phase of the study, participants answered questions related to identification data, self-assessment protocols of vocal behavior and communicative resources; besides that, they were asked to select the positive and negative communication resources of their own speech during the sales. In the next phase, the participants were divided into two groups according to their sales performance: Group A (GA), individuals with better sales performance and Group B (GB), individuals with worst sales performance. The data were statistically analyzed. Regarding the vocal behavior self-assessment, the sales representatives considered their voice quality as normal, their vocal pitch, loudness and speech rate as regular and as having an expressive voice. Regarding the communicative behavior, there was low presence of regionalism, use of gesture and use of other support resources during the sales; contrarily, there was high occurrence of precise articulation of speech sounds, visual contact, lack of inhibition to talk, time monitoring and objectivity of the speech. The sales representatives' self-assessment was positive for the objectivity of the speech, knowledge of the subject and use of proper vocabulary; it was negative for, lack of subject domain, criticism and prejudgment, and improper vocabulary. The self-assessment was similar in GA and GB.
