The scope of this article is to verify the factors associated with providing educational guidance related to oral health during prenatal care in the Metropolitan Region of Greater Vit√≥ria - ES, Brazil. It involved a cross-sectional study of 1,035 postpartum women in public or affiliated private hospitals in the SUS in 2010. A descriptive analysis of the main educational information and binomial logistic regression was conducted to test the association between individual and contextual variables and 'receiving educational guidance through meetings and/or pregnant mother groups in the health unit and/or through home visits'. The information given most during prenatal care was 'the advantage of exclusive breastfeeding until six months of life' (52.0%) and least was 'the importance of fluoride use in health' (18.9%). Being attended by the Family Health Strategy (FHS) (OR=1.94), having adequate living conditions for women and children (OR=1.73) and an additional prenatal visit (OR=1.08), increased the chance of providing educational guidance in prenatal care. Frequent pre-natal visits, coverage of health services in line with the FHS, and adequate conditions of housing were factors that were positively associated with educational guidance during prenatal care.
