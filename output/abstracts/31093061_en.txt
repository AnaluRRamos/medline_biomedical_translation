In Cuba, health research is based on the priorities of national scientific policy, derived from the health status of the population. The objective of this article is to describe the characteristics of the System of Science and Technological Innovation and how the results of its research benefit the health of the population groups. To this end, research related to the generation of products and technologies, diabetes, dengue and disability was selected. This system follows a methodology outlined by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment and has 37 research entities. It is organized into programs and projects that favor basic and applied research, with a multidisciplinary and intersectoral approach; these programs and projects are funded mostly by the State and are organized in self-contained cycles, i.e., the same entity is responsible for the entire process, from research to marketing, including market studies and post-marketing surveillance. The selected research shows an alignment between the research, the generalization of the results and its effect in improving health and universal access to health in the population. Positive results were obtained in diagnostic methods, preventive and therapeutic vaccines, warning signs for the prognosis and treatment of dengue, prevention of congenital malformations, and policies and programs that have benefited people with disabilities and their families. The will of the State to develop and fund scientific research, intersectoral action, the definition of research priorities, and the systematic training and attention to human resources have been key factors for the fulfillment of the objectives of the system.
