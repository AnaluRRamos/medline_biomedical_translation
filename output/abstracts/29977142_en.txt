Several studies have already described the main injuries to soccer players during FIFA World Cup events; however, little is known about the main reasons spectators require medical assistance during these matches. The aim of this study is to assess the number of cases and main reasons spectators required medical assistance during the 2014 World Cup matches in Brazil. Data were collected from spectators who received medical assistance on all game days, and factors related to the assistance provided were analyzed. Medical assistance was given to spectators in a total of 6,222 cases during the 64 games played in Brazil, an average of 97.2 times per game. The total number of spectators removed from the stadiums by ambulance was 167, a mean of 2.6 removals per game. The main reasons spectators required medical assistance during the World Cup games were headache, gastrointestinal problems, and trauma. Most spectators required medical assistance during the World Cup games for headache, gastrointestinal problems, and trauma; this information is fundamental to develop new prevention strategies and plan medical assistance for large-scale events. <b>Level of Evidence IV; Case series.</b>
