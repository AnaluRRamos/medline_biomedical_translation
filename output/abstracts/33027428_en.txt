This article presents the history and construction of the National Health Survey (PNS) 2019, a household survey conducted in partnership with the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. The objective of PNS 2019 was to provide the country with information on the health determinants, conditionants and needs of the Brazilian population. The expected sample was 108,525 households, considering a 20% non-response rate. The questionnaire had three parts, covering: (i) the household; (ii) all residents of the household, focusing on collection of socioeconomic and health information; and (iii) the selected resident (15 years old or more) for whom lifestyles, chronic diseases, violence, among other topics were investigated, as well as their anthropometric measurements (subsample). The information provided by PNS 2019 will serve as a basis for the (re)formulation of health policies, as well as support for existing actions and programs of the Brazilian National Health System.
