Patient-centered care is an incipient movement and its practice still faces obstacles in the Brazilian health system, where it is not extensively identified as healthcare quality realm. Thus, this paper aims to establish a patient/person-centered care research agenda to support its implementation in the country's healthcare services. A panel was held with nine experts to grasp different views on the subject. The face-to-face discussion was supported by a document systematizing an initial agenda proposal and a brief presentation of the patient-centered care concept and theoretical elements that underpin its practice. Panel participants defined a set of items to be explored in studies to identify implementation and to strengthen and to measure strategies for patient-centered care in the Brazilian context.
