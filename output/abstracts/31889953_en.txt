Assess the association between social and economic conditions and homicide rates in young people between 10 and 24 years of age in Mexico in 2017. This ecological study looked at the social inequalities associated with homicides in the population 10-24-year-old population in 2017 in Mexico, using secondary data sources for deaths by homicide in each Mexican state. Social inequalities in health were studied by measuring absolute and relative inequality gaps. Mortality rates were estimated using Poisson regression models. In 2017, there were 8,094 homicides in the target population, predominantly in men (86.7%). There was high variance in inequality between states. Unemployment in the population over 12 years of age, households composed of people who are not family members, low school attendance rates, and income below the poverty line showed significant association with homicide rates. There is a strong association between social determinants and homicides in the study population. Policies and intersectoral actions should be implemented to help bridge inequality gaps and achieve better living conditions and higher levels of well-being and health for people and their communities.
