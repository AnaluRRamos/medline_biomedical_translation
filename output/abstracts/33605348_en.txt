The scope of this study was to estimate the prevalence of spinal disorders among the elderly and analyze potential associated factors. It involved a cross-sectional study of a sample of 1,593 elderly individuals aged 60 years or more residing in the urban area of Bag√©, State of Rio Grande do Sul. In addition to the 'spinal disorders' outcome, demographic, socioeconomic and behavioral variables, health perception, functional activities and the use of health services were investigated. Data collection was conducted by means of face-to-face interviews. Poisson regression analysis with robust variance was used to verify the factors associated with the outcome analyzed. Of the 1,593 participants, 37.4% reported spinal disorders. The factors related to the outcome were: low level of schooling, poor self-assessment of health, consultation in the last three months and the presence of hypertension, rheumatism and fractures. Interventions for musculoskeletal health can contribute to reduce the damages caused by spinal disorders among the elderly, such as loss of functional capacity, increased demands for health care and reduced quality of life.
