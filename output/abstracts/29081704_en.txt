While several radiographic parameters have been established to describe the geometry and pathology of the hip, their reference values and clinical significance remain a matter of dispute. The present study tests the hypothesis that age has a relevant impact on radiographic hip parameters. Pelvic antero-posterior views were measured for CE angle, Sharp's angle, acetabular depth-to-width ratio, femoral head extrusion index, roof obliquity, caput-collum-diaphyseal (CCD) angle, and Murray's femoral head ratio, and the values obtained were correlated with age. Significant weak and moderate linear correlations (all Ps<0.001) were observed between age and CE angle (ρ=0.31), Sharp's angle (ρ=-0.38), extrusion index (ρ=-0.22), CCD angle (ρ=-0.15), depth-to-width ratio (ρ=-0.38), and roof obliquity (ρ=-0.19), while Murray's femoral head ratio (ρ=0.05; P=0.274) was not associated with age. Interestingly, the parameters describing the acetabulum all showed a relevant increase in coverage with age, leading to CE-angles well beyond 40° and a Sharp's angle below 35° in a large portion of asymptomatic older adults. While a decrease in CCD angle with age is described in most orthopedic textbooks, the changes observed with age in acetabular geometry far exceed those measured at the femoral head-neck junction. We recommend considering these alterations that may be attributable to age when formulating a radiographic diagnosis. <b>Level of Evidence III, Diagnostic Studies - Investigating a Diagnostic Test.</b>
