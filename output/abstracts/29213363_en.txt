The diagnosis of dementia is based on cognitive and functional evaluation. One of the difficulties in ascertaining the number of people with dementia in developing countries is the population's lack of formal education. Independent effects of age, sex and education have been identified on scores for most but not all cognitive tests. Identify the most-used cognitive and functional assessment tools in Brazil, related to dementia diagnosis and treatment outcome; and identify adaptations or normative data, when available. Data were generated from PubMed, LILACS and Portal Periodicos CAPES (thesis database) databases using the search terms 'dementia' and 'Alzheimer'. Data collection criteria were a. Articles with abstract; b. Brazilian abstracts, related to adult Brazilian population; c. Clear mention of assessment tool in the abstract text. A total of 108 abstracts were selected for the main analysis: a. to identify the instruments used b. to determine how many of the selected abstracts mentioned each tool and c. to search in the mentioned databases for respective test adaptations or normative data. Some 52 different assessment tools, 41 cognitive instruments and 11 functional instruments were identified. The most cited assessment tests were the Mini Mental State Examination (64 abstracts) and Pfeffer Functional Activities Questionnaire (4 abstracts). Many of the instruments used only have the description of the translation process into Portuguese, along with some suggestions of validation or normative data. Few of these followed the recommended procedures of validation, replication, normalization or transcultural adaptation.
