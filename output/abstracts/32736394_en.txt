We performed a systematic review to assess the effectiveness and safety of <i>Tribulus terrestris</i> to treat female sexual dysfunction (FSD).  We performed unrestricted electronic searches in the MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE, LILACS, CINAHL, PsycINFO, WHO-ICTR, Clinicaltrials.gov and OpenGrey databases.  We included any randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared <i>T. terrestris</i> versus inactive/active interventions. After the selection process, conducted by two reviewers, 5 RCTs (<i>n</i> = 279 participants) were included.  Data extraction was performed by two reviewers with a preestablished data collection formulary.  Due to lack of data and clinical heterogeneity, we could not perform meta-analyses. The risk of bias was assessed by the Cochrane Risk of Bias (RoB) tool, and the certainty of evidence was assessed with Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE).  After 1 to 3 months of treatment, premenopausal and postmenopausal women randomized to <i>T. terrestris</i> had a significant increase in sexual function scores. Three months of treatment with <i>T. terrestris</i> showed a significant increase in the serum testosterone levels of premenopausal women. There was no report of serious adverse events, and none of the studies assessed health-related quality of life. The certainty of the evidence was very low, which means that we have very little confidence in the effect estimates, and future studies are likely to change these estimates.  More RCTs are needed to support or refute the use of <i>T. terrestris</i>. The decision to use this intervention should be shared with the patients, and the uncertainties around its effects should be discussed in the clinical decision-making process.Number of Protocol registration in PROSPERO database: CRD42019121130.
