The aim of this study was to evaluate the functional results, complications, and morbidity and mortality rates in patients with end-stage chronic renal failure (ESCRF) with collum femoris fractures who were treated with hemiarthroplasty. From 2005 to 2013, patients with ESCRF admitted to our hospital with collum femoris fracture and treated with hemiarthroplasty were retrospectively evaluated, and 44 hips in 42 patients were included in the study. Duration of hospital stay, bleeding, complications, morbidity and mortality were recorded for each patient. At the last control evaluation, patients were assessed via pelvis x-ray and functional status according to Harris Hip Score (HHS). Patients required a mean 2.7 units of erythrocyte suspension. Mean hospital stay was 19.74 days. The most common complication was bleeding. The complication rate was 38.1%; mortality rate at first-year follow-up was 42.8%, and mean HHS was 74.5. Collum femoris fractures are more common in ESCRF patients due to metabolic bone disease, and these patients had many comorbidities which may exacerbate high complication and mortality rates. Orthopedic surgeons should consider these higher complication rates and inform patients about the consequences of this treatment. <b>Level of Evidence IV, Case Series.</b>
