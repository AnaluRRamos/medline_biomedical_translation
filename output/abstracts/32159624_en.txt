The 24-hour recall (R24h) has been the method for dietary assessment in surveys. Technological advances have allowed the development of a program for the collection of R24h data. International Agency for Research on Cancer-World Health Organization (IARC-WHO) developed a standardized interview and computer-based 24-hour dietary recall program called GloboDiet, aimed at using it in research and nutrition surveillance. Brazil was included in a project for the global expansion of this methodology for developing and adapting a version for national use. The adaptation followed the procedures established by the IARC-WHO that considered the translation and adaptation of approximately 70 databases. For the development of the food list, national databases of food consumption from national surveys were consulted obtaining a final list of 2113 foods and recipes. GloboDiet program guides an interview in five steps: general information of the participant; quick list of foods and recipes; details of food / recipes and quantities consumed using mainly a picture book; control of the amount of food and nutrients; and information on dietary supplements. The Brazilian version of the GloboDiet program will provide a more accurate assessment of food intake based on a standardized method for nutrition surveillance and investigation of the relationship between diet and health outcomes, as well as comparisons of dietary intakes within and between countries.
