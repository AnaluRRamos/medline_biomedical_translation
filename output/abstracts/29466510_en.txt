Evaluate the effectiveness of educational interventions on hearing health developed at a hospital laundry. Quantitative assessment conducted at a hospital laundry. The study sample comprised 80 workers of both genders divided into two groups: Study Group (SG) and Control Group (CG). The educational interventions in hearing preservation were evaluated based on a theoretical approach using the Participatory Problem-based Methodology in five workshops. To assess the results of the workshops, an instrument containing 36 questions on knowledge, attitudes, and practices in hearing preservation at work was used. Questionnaires A and B were applied prior to and one month after intervention, respectively. The answers to both questionnaires were analyzed by group according to gender and schooling. Results of the pre-intervention phase showed low scores regarding knowledge about hearing health in the work setting for both groups, but significant improvement in knowledge was observed after intervention in the SG, with 77.7% of the answers presenting significant difference between the groups. There was also an improvement in the mean scores, with 35 responses (95.22%) presenting scores >4 (considered adequate). The women presented lower knowledge scores than the men; however, these differences were not observed in the SG after the workshops. Schooling was not a relevant factor in the assessment. The educational proposal grounded in the Participatory Problem-based Methodology expanded knowledge about hearing health at work among the participants.
