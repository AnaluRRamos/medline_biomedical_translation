Psychoeducational activities are a way of promoting help for caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's disease, representing a forum for knowledge sharing, and in which the primary focus is on psychological themes aimed at carers developing coping skills and strategies. The main objective of this study was to gauge perceptions about care and its impact among family caregivers of patients with AD participating in a psychoeducational group intervention, as well as the possible positive and negative aspects associated with this role. The subjective impact of AD on the lives of these caregivers was assessed on each of the dimensions of the Caregiver Burden Scale using a semi-directed interview on perceptions about care. This was a prospective study, in which information was collected twice, before and after, psychoeducational intervention. Through the application of the scale, benefits were evident for all dimensions assessed in the instrument (general strain, isolation, disappointment, emotional involvement and environment). The results showed that after the psychoeducational intervention, caregivers felt less burdened by care compared to pre-intervention. Conclusion: These findings confirm that expanded implementation of psychoeducational interventions for caregivers of patients with AD can be beneficial for both caregivers and patients.
