The prevalence of depression is high in the prison system, and the differences between sex regarding associated risk factors are still not clear. We analyzed the correlated factors of depression among incarcerated men and women in the state of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. A cross-sectional study with stratified and multi-stage probabilistic sample was performed. Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) was applied for psychiatric diagnostic classification, as well as a questionnaire on criminal history with 1,192 men and 617 women. Lifetime prevalence of mental disorder was calculated, and association analysis performed by multinomial logistic regression stratified by sex. A dependent variable was categorized into depression, any other mental disorder and no mental disorder (reference). The prevalence of depression was of 33.3% -(30.3 - 36.5) in women and 12.9% (11.1 - 15.0) in men. Depression was associated with disciplinary penalty, being in a stable relationship, physical health problems and history of infringement in adolescence in men. Regarding other mental illnesses, the correlated factors were historical transgression during adolescence and re-offense. Among women, depression was associated with physical health problems, drug crimes, violent crimes and being imprisoned. Results confirmed the differences between associated factors with depression regarding sex. Differences in the profile between men and women require effective specialized programs, considering the need for coping strategies for incarcerated men and health-related rehabilitation for women with depression.
