To assess, through a systematic literature review, whether or not it is necessary to suspend antithrombotic medications (warfarin, aspirin, and clopidogrel) to perform elective wrist and hand surgeries. The search for articles was performed using a combination of keywords in the databases available, without scientific design constraints, being selected series with five or more surgeries; the selected articles were analyzed regarding serious (need for surgical treatment) and mild complications (without surgery). Seven articles were retrieved and analyzed; 410 wrist and hand surgeries were performed in patients on warfarin or aspirin and clopidogrel, with three serious complications (0.7%) and 38 mild (9.2%); 2023 surgeries were performed in patients without use of antithrombotics, with zero serious and 18 (0.8%) minor complications. Patients using warfarin or oral antiplatelet (aspirin, clopidogrel, and aspirin associated with clopidogrel) need not suspend the medication to undergo wrist and hand surgery.
