This Essay discusses the theme of teachers' work and health in Brazil. The objectives are to describe the initial history of research on teachers' health, discuss elements leading to a consensus on the characterization of the group's work and principal health problems, and systematize the main strides and challenges. The Essay draws on more than two decades of research and practice in this field. Based on this experience, the authors identify the movements, the accumulated evidence, and prospects for future development. The elements brought to the discussion point to substantial growth in the field: the number of studies, the diversity and scope of topics, the groups of men and women teachers studied, and the experiences with application of the knowledge (programs and interventions). Despite these strides, the studies and practices still emphasize the individual and the disease, with little or no attention to work factors (work process and management) in the health/disease process. Issues pertaining to gender differences (in work and in health status) also remain invisible. There is little linkage between researchers and teachers' movements (a relevant characteristic of the first initiatives in the field). There are no public policies to regulate the workplace and work management. The contributions to the discussion provide insight for thought to assist the identification of critical nodes and analytical scenarios with the potential for progress in this field of research and intervention.
