To analyze the social and conceptual skills of people with Intellectual Disability. A descriptive study conducted with 100 caregivers, 9 teachers and 100 people with Intellectual Disability from a Philanthropic Institution in Campina Grande, Para√≠ba, Brazil. The participants ages in the study ranged from 9 to 83 years. Three-hundred (300) questionnaires were administered. The data were processed by Factorial Matching Analysis in the Tri-Deux-Mots program . Considering the factorial correspondence plan, it should be noted that the social skills of students in the age group between 21 and 40 years were related to playing educational games, playing ball with friends and dating. Regarding conceptual skills, students revealed autonomy in relation to school activities, however the caregivers emphasized that they lack autonomy in relation to these skills. In perceiving the realities of students from different classes, teachers presented opposing opinions on dependency and independence issues. Education and health professionals and caregivers can collaborate more effectively in developing the autonomy of people with Intellectual Disability by promoting a more interactive environment which provides skills development and interpersonal relationships without discrimination, disrespect or prejudice.
