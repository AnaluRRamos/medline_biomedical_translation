To determine the proportion of traumatologists who investigate osteoporosis in elderly patients with fractures and recommend secondary prevention of osteoporotic fractures. We distributed questionnaires to 244 physicians attending the 2015 Brazilian Congress of Orthopedic Trauma. We determined the respondents' profiles and assessed how they investigated and treated osteoporosis in elderly patients with fractures. Overall, 32% of the respondents reported that their knowledge level regarding osteoporosis ranged from 0-5 (out of 0-10). In total, 42% of the participants reported that they usually requested DXA for elderly patients with fractures and less than 30% reported prescribing supplemental calcium and/or vitamin D. We considered physicians conducting a complete treatment for the patient as those who in addition to requesting DXA prescribed supplemental calcium, vitamin D, and specific medications for their elderly patients, and recommended non-pharmacological measures. Only 0.8% of the participants fulfilled all these criteria. In addition, 47% of the traumatologists reported that they did not treat osteoporosis directly but instead, referred osteoporotic patients to a qualified physician. Less than 50% of the surveyed traumatologists investigated and performed secondary prevention against osteoporotic fractures after treating an elderly patient with a fracture. <b><i>Level of evidence III, Economic and Decision Analyses - Developing an Economic or Decisions Model.</i></b>
