The article aimed to describe epidemiological indicators and characteristics of new cases of leprosy in elderly Brazilians in 2016-2018, compared to other age groups. A descriptive cross-sectional cohort study was conducted with data from the Information System on Diseases of Notification (SINAN). New leprosy cases were categorized by age groups: 60 or more, 40-59, 15-39, and 15 years of age. Pearson's chi-square test was used to verify differences between groups. A total of 81,205 new leprosy cases were reported in Brazil. Of these, 24.1% were elderly, 37.7% from 40-59 years, 31.9% from 15-39 years, and 6.3% in individuals under 15 years of age. The elderly showed higher proportions (p < 0.001) of cases in males (60.1%), with multibacillary classification (81.3%), and with physical disability grade 2 (PDG2) (11.4%) when compared to the other groups. However, the proportion of new cases detected in the elderly based on contact testing (4.9%) was the lowest among all the age brackets (p < 0.001). The mean detection rate and rate of new cases with PDG2 at diagnosis were higher among the elderly (25.1/100,000 and 28.6/million inhabitants, respectively) compared to other age groups in Brazil as a whole and in the regions and states. Important differences were seen in the epidemiological and clinical profile of leprosy in the elderly compared to other age brackets, especially higher proportions of multibacillary cases, new cases with PDG2, and low detection by contact testing. The findings highlighted the need for leprosy control in this age group, aimed at contributing to interruption of transmission of the disease.
