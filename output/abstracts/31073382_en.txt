Several screening tests have been used for cognitive evaluation in Parkinson's disease (PD). To evaluate the usefulness of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in patients with Parkinson's disease and no cognitive impairment complaints. A total of 40 PD patients with no complaints of cognitive problems were included. Patients were selected using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the MoCA was then administered. 80% of patients exhibited Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) according to the MoCA. Statistically significant differences in visuospatial, attention and delayed recall functions were evident between the normal and abnormal MoCA groups. The study results suggest that MoCA may be a good screening test in patients with PD who do not present cognitive complaints.
