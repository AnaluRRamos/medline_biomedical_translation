To review the scientific findings on the baby-led weaning method (BLW) in the context of complementary feeding. Two independent examiners searched the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE)/PubMed database in August 2016. No time-period was defined for the publication dates. The following descriptors were used: 'baby-led weaning' OR 'baby-led' OR 'BLW'. Inclusion criteria were: original studies that were available in English, and which addressed the BLW method. Exclusion criteria were: references in other languages, opinion articles and literature reviews, editorials and publications that did not elaborate on the intended subject. Of the 97 references identified, 13 were included in the descriptive synthesis. The BLW group of babies, when compared to the traditional eating group, were less prone to being overweight, less demanding of food, and ate the same foods as the family. The number of choking episodes did not differ between groups. Mothers who opted for the implementation of BLW had higher levels of schooling, held managerial positions at work, and were more likely to have breastfed until the sixth month of the child's life. Concerns were raised about messes made during meals, wasting food, and choking, but most of the mothers recommended adopting the method. Health professionals were hesitant to indicate this method. BLW was recommended by mothers who followed the method with their own children. However, concerns have been reported, which, coupled with professionals' fears about the inability of infants to self-feed, reflect a lack of knowledge about the method.
