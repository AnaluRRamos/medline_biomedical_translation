The aim of this study was to evaluate the degree of conversion, cytotoxicity, solubility and pH of photopolymerizable calciumbased cements submitted to preheating. The degree of conversion was analyzed by Fourier transform infrared, cytotoxicity by the MTT test and solubility through loss of mass. The data were subjected to statistical tests (ANOVA / Tukey's, p<0.05). The photopolymerizable materials showed a low degree of conversion, regardless of preheating. All materials caused a reduction in cell viability at 24 hours and 7 days, with the Dycal (control) being more cytotoxic. Heat had a positive effect on Biocal at 7 days. Dycal is the most soluble material. Heat had no effect on the solubility or pH of the polymerizable materials. It is concluded that photopolymerizable calcium-based cements have a low degree of conversion and are soluble, which results in mild to moderate cytotoxicity.
