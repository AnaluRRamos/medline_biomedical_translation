This study aims to review, identify and study the determinations of the main orthopedic aspects in SCI patients. A total of 80 articles from PUBMED and three theses (MSc. /DSc.) were examined. The results refer to the most essential joints. There is a chronic overload on the shoulder girdle due to the use of the upper limb as a supporting joint. The elbow presents osteoarthritis, subclinical, acute and chronic pain, mainly in quadriplegic patients. In the hand and wrist joints there are cases of paralysis, osteoporosis and osteoarthritis. Hips are the main weight-bearing joints while sitting which leads to a substantial degenerative process of this joint. Lastly, on the knee, feet and ankles, spasticity, contractures, osteoporosis and deformities can arise. Along with the increase in cases and research that analyze the alterations that spinal cord-injured individuals suffer, it is necessary to recognize the orthopedic changes to understand their limits and identify the relevance of the rehabilitation program to improve the muscle performance. <b>Level of Evidence II, Prognostic Studies - Investigating the Effect of a Patient Characteristic on the Outcome of Disease</b>.
