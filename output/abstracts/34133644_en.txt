To estimate the prevalence of high cardiovascular risk (CVR), the proportion of people with high CVR who receive treatment and counseling, and to investigate the sociodemographic factors associated with this outcome, in Brazil. This was a cross-sectional study, using subsample data from the National Health Survey, collected via biochemical tests, in 2014-2015. Poisson regression was used. The proportion of high CVR in men was 11.2% (95%CI 9.6;12.9), and 10.4% (95%CI 9.2;11.8%) in women. In the group with high CVR, 68.8% (95%CI 63.7;73.4%) received counseling, 59.3% (95%CI 54.2;64.3%) received medication, and 55.6% (95%CI 50.4;60.7%) received both. In the multivariate analysis, receiving treatment and counseling was associated with being aged 50 years and over, and poor/very poor self-rated health (PR=1.26 - 95%CI 1.06;1.51). The proportion of people with high CVR who had received treatment and counseling was over 50%.
