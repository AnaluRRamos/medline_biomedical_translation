to identify risk factors for the occurrence of postoperative complications in laparoscopic cholecystectomies (LC) in elderly patients. an observational study with analysis of medical records of patients aged 60 years and older, submitted to elective LC at Gaffree e Guinle Universitary Hospital, from 2006 to 2018. Surgeries performed on an emergency basis or converted to the conventional technique were excluded from our study. a total of 345 patients were included in our study, being 80% females and 62% aged 60-69 years. There were 39 cases of postoperative complications (11.3%), mostly (87%) classified as grades I or II of Clavien-Dindo surgical complication scale. There was only one death. The presence and the number of coexisting diseases and ASA II or III physical status classification of preoperative patients conferred a greater risk for the development of postoperative complications and mortality. our study identified the presence of coexisting diseases, as well as their severity, according to ASA classification, as risk factors for the development of postoperative complications of LC in elderly patients. However, LC proved to be a safe technique when used in these patients with low morbidity and mortality rates.
