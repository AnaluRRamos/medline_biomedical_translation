To identify work process-related causes associated with nursing errors reported in newspapers. This was a documentary and qualitative study based on the work process theory and hermeneutic analysis that examined 112 news articles published between 2012 and 2016 in 21 high-circulation Brazilian newspapers, organized and codified using Atlas.ti software. The causes associated with the reported errors were associated with workforce (lack of professionals and training, turnover, work overload, lack of information, recklessness, negligence, and distraction); work instruments (similar labels or packages, storage, lack of product identification and information, and medical prescriptions); and the object of nursing work (overcrowding and specific characteristics of patient). Analysis of the possible causes of reported errors identified the negative outcomes of nursing work, while also identifying elements of the work process that influenced these results. The findings emphasize the importance of understanding these errors so they can be avoided and of reviewing nursing work conditions to guarantee quality and safety of care.
