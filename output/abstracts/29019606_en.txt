This article analyzes representations of medical knowledge in Goiás in the early decades of the twentieth century through anecdotes and articles in the Catholic newspaper Santuário da Trindade, which circulated from 1922 to 1931. The anecdotes reflect a certain distancing from the modernization of medicine and ridicule medical science, demonstrating what Bakhtin characterized as the irreverence of popular culture in relation to serious institutions. On the other hand, medical knowledge was greatly esteemed in the paper's articles, and served to legitimize the moralizing discourse of its editors. Therefore, in the same newspaper this knowledge was simultaneously represented respectfully and mocked, revealing the complexity of how changes in medical practices during the period were absorbed.
