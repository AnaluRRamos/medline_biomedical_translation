To identify patterns in the spatial distribution of homicide death rates, considering the proportion of deaths of undetermined intent in the municipalities of the State of Bahia, from 2002 to 2013. An ecological study was carried out, using data from the Mortality Information System (SIM). Theproportional mortality of undetermined intent on the total external causes and the homicide rate were analyzed in several municipalities of Bahia and considering the Health Macro-regions (HMRs). A-non-random mortality distribution pattern was observed, according to the overall Moran index, which was clearer in the 2005-2007, 2008-2010 and 2011-2013 triennia. The highest proportions of undetermined deaths, â‰¥ 50%, were concentrated in the State's Western region. On the other hand, the highest homicide rates were observed in the Far South, South and East regions - coastal municipalities. The same municipalities and regions identified with low homicide rates concomitantly presented high proportions of undetermined deaths, and conversely, where there were high rates, there was also a low proportion of undetermined death. Therefore,it is essential to take into account the quality of information about the underlying cause.
