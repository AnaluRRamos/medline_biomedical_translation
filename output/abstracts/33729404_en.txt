This article addresses sexual violence, a topic that makes up the Clinical Protocol and Therapeutic Guidelines for Comprehensive Care for People with Sexually Transmitted Infections, published by the Ministry of Health of Brazil. Guidance is given to managers in programmatic and operational management with a focus on the service network for people in situations of sexual violence, recommendations to health professionals about prophylactic measures of pregnancy and viral and non-viral sexually transmitted infections, in addition to strategies for surveillance actions. Sexual violence is a broad problem that goes beyond the health field and involves conceptual and programmatic challenges for both health professionals, who are at the forefront of care for affected people, and for society, in terms of possible forms of prevention.
