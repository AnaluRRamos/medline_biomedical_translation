This manuscript is related to the chapter about human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) that is part of the Clinical Protocol and Therapeutic Guidelines for Comprehensive Care for People with Sexually Transmitted Infections, published by the Brazilian Health Ministry. HTLV-1/2 infection is a worldwide public health problem and Brazil has the largest number of individuals living with the virus. HTLV-1 causes a variety of clinical manifestations of a neoplastic nature, such as adult leukemia/T-cell lymphoma, and also of an inflammatory nature, such as HTLV-1-associated myelopathy, as well as other manifestations such as uveitis, arthritis and infective dermatitis. These pathologies have high morbidity and mortality and negatively impact the quality of life of infected individuals. This review includes relevant information for health service managers and workers regarding virus transmission modes, diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of individuals living with HTLV-1 and 2 in Brazil.
