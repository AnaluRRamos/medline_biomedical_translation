The aging population calls for instruments to assess functional and cognitive impairment in the elderly, aiming to prevent conditions that affect functional abilities. To verify the accuracy and reliability of the Pfeffer (FAQ) scale for the Brazilian elderly population and to evaluate the reliability and reproducibility of the translated version of the Pfeffer Questionnaire. The Brazilian version of the FAQ was applied to 110 elderly divided into two groups. Both groups were assessed by two blinded investigators at baseline and again after 15 days. In order to verify the accuracy and reliability of the instrument, sensitivity and specificity measurements for the presence or absence of functional and cognitive decline were calculated for various cut-off points and the ROC curve. Intra and inter-examiner reliability were assessed using the Interclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman plots. For the occurrence of cognitive decline, the ROC curve yielded an area under the curve of 0.909 (95%CI of 0.845 to 0.972), sensitivity of 75.68% (95%CI of 93.52% to 100%) and specificity of 97.26%. For the occurrence of functional decline, the ROC curve yielded an area under the curve of 0.851 (95%CI of 64.52% to 87.33%) and specificity of 80.36% (95%CI of 69.95% to 90.76%). The ICC was excellent, with all values exceeding 0.75. On the Bland-Altman plot, intra-examiner agreement was good, with p>0.05consistently close to 0. A systematic difference was found for inter-examiner agreement. The Pfeffer Questionnaire is applicable in the Brazilian elderly population and showed reliability and reproducibility compared to the original test.
