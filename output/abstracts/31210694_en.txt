The term avascular necrosis describes any one of a number of bone diseases that have a common mechanism: the death of bone components due to lack of blood supply. Avascular necrosis can occur in diverse parts of the skeleton, each location-specific form not only receiving a distinct designation but also presenting unique epidemiologic characteristics. However, the imaging findings are similar in all of the forms, which pass through well-described radiological phases, regardless of the site of involvement. Because avascular necrosis can cause considerable morbidity if not properly detected and managed, the radiologist plays a fundamental role. The present study provides a brief review of the main radiological aspects of the various forms of avascular necrosis, illustrated on the basis of a collection of cases from our institution.
