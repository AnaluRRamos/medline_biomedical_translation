The study analyzed the use of the Paideia Method for training professionals that use matrix support in Curitiba (Paraná State), Uberlândia (Minas Gerais State), and Campinas (São Paulo State), Brazil. An 18-month training process (Specialization Course) was developed for this purpose with matrix support professionals. This was a qualitative study inspired by action-based research, research-intervention, and evaluation by triangulation of methods. Data production used field observation strategies with records kept in a field diary, semi-structured interviews with a questionnaire, and focus group. Data from the questionnaires were submitted to descriptive analysis. The qualitative data collected with participant observation and focus groups were analyzed with the construction of narratives. The study showed that Paideia Training fostered changes in the work process and in clinical practice among the teams. However, the full utilization of the matrix support methodology is heavily influenced by the institutional setting and management and healthcare models. An important difference was observed between the fields according to the degree of democratization and management's support for organizational changes.
