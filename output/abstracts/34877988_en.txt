The study investigated how the interaction between axes of marginalization based on race/color, gender, schooling, and interpersonal discrimination affect different dimensions of quality of life in adult individuals. This is a cross-sectional study with data from the second wave of the EpiFloripa Adult Study in Florian√≥polis, southern Brazil, in 2012. We estimated linear regression models for each domain and for overall quality of life, measured with WHOQOL-Bref. The KHB method was used to estimate the mediating role of perceived discrimination in the associations between the axes of marginalization and quality of life. The analysis showed that schooling and gender operate additivelly, but not intersectionally, on overall quality of life and on the physical domain, with a disadvantage for women and individuals with 11 years of schooling or less. Schooling and race/color were predictors of the environmental domain, with lower mean values for blacks and individuals with 11 years of schooling or less. In the psychological domain, the intersection between gender and schooling resulted in a mean value 2.9 points higher for women with 12 or more years of schooling. Gender and race/color were predictors of quality of life in the social domain, reducing the mean value for black women by 11.3 points. Mediation analyses showed that 29.6% of the effect of the intersection between schooling and gender on the psychological domain and 4.3% of the effect of the intersection between race/color and gender on the social domain were mediated by interpersonal discrimination. These results confirmed the study hypotheses, pointing to the importance and contribution of an intersectional analysis for studying inequities in quality of life.
