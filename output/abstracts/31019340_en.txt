Developments in magnetic resonance imaging have expanded its role in the assessment of the female pelvis, including the diagnosis of ovarian lesions. In this setting, diffusion-weighted imaging has proven its diagnostic value, which is particularly important in differentiating between benign and malignant ovarian tumors. In general, the latter show restricted diffusion, whereas the former do not. Exceptions include teratomas, endometriomas, hemorrhagic cysts, ovarian abscesses, ovarian infarction, and some benign stromal tumors. The aim of this review is to draw attention to benign ovarian lesions with restricted diffusion, with a special focus on diffusion-weighted imaging pearls and pitfalls.
