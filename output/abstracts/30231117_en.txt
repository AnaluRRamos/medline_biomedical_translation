To identify the knowledge of professionals about assistive technology and its importance in the elderly's life. Exploratory descriptive qualitative study performed with professionals working in three community groups in the city of Cajazeiras (state of Para√≠ba/PB). Data were collected through an interview with semi-structured script and analyzed according to the Content Analysis Technique. Participation of 45 professionals. Four categories were identified, namely: Knowledge about assistive technology; Professionals' lack of knowledge about available assistive technologies for implementation in work with the elderly; Use of assistive technology by the elderly; Impact on professional practices after implementation of assistive technology. Some of professionals have knowledge about assistive technology and others make a wrong interpretation by confusing it with working instruments. In spite of the positive impact of assistive technology on certain professionals' practice, there is need for training in order to provide a better use of assistive technologies by the elderly.
