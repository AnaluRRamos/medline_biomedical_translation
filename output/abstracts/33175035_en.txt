This paper aims to estimate the prevalence of cardiovascular health and the validity of the Brazilian population's self-reported score. This is a cross-sectional, methodological study with 8,943 individual adults and laboratory data from the 2013 National Health Survey. We employed behavioral (body mass index, tobacco use, diet, physical activity, ideal if ≥ 3 ideal factors), biological (tobacco use, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes, ideal if ≥ 3 ideal factors), and cardiovascular health scores (all factors, ideal if ≥ 4 ideal factors). Prevalence of sensitivity and specificity scores and analyses of the self-reported scores were estimated, considering the scores with measured variables as the gold standard. Approximately 56.7% of individuals had ideal values for the measured cardiovascular health score. Sensitivity was 92% and specificity 30% for the self-reported biological score. Sensitivity and specificity scores were, respectively, 90.6% and 97.2% for self-reported behavior. The self-reported cardiovascular health score had a sensitivity of 92.4% and specificity of 48.5%. A little over half of the population had an ideal cardiovascular health score. The self-reported score showed good sensitivity and lower proportions of specificity.
