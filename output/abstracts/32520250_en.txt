The scope of this study was to profile non-frail elderly individuals in Long-Stay Care Institutions in Natal, emphasizing social integration and stratification in philanthropic and private institutions in 2012. The instrument used was the Brazil Old Age Schedule (BOAS). Descriptive analysis was carried out and sociodemographic and health profiles of the elderly were estimated using the Grade of Membership (GoM) scale to obtain social integration typologies. The results indicated that 68 elderly were eligible; 63.2% were female, and 51.5% were 80 years or older; 43% reported poor or extremely poor health. The application of the GoM method yielded three profiles. The first is characterized by the elderly with higher presence of sociable/integrated men living in philanthropic institutions (22% of the elderly); the second mainly encompasses women in philanthropic institutions, with vulnerable health conditions and depression (34.9%); the third is the profile with higher levels of integration/sociability in private institutions, but also characterized by elderly persons with functional disability (34.9%). This study is important since integration and independence must be a part of social life of the elderly irrespective of the place where they live.
