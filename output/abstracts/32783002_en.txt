We evaluated 19 professionals aged (31.05±6.63 years) who worked in the three family health support centers (FHSC) of the city of Vitória de Santo Antão. Whoqol-bref and Baecke questionnaires were applied. Data normality was verified from the Shapiro-Wilk test and the Pearson correlation test was performed. Positive Correlations were found between general score and physical activity during exercise and leisure (r=0, 852; p<0,001) and physical activity at work (r=0,611; p<0.001). There was a positive correlation between the physical domain of quality of life and the general score of habitual physical activity (r=0,520; p<0.05). There was a positive correlation between length of service and physical activity in exercise and leisure (r=-0.649; p<0.001) and physical activity at work (r=-0.559; p<0.05). The results allow us to conclude that there are positive correlations between activity level and quality of life. The practice of a physical activity is fundamental to the maintenance of work activities. Besides reflecting positively on social aspects.
