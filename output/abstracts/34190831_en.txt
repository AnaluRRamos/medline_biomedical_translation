The identification of the magnitude of chronic Chagas disease in Brazil requires linking activities in health surveillance, seeking to develop a wide, hierarchically organized and geographically distributed network of services to provide care to thousands of individuals with Trypanosoma cruzi infection. The study aimed to elaborate a model for prioritization of municipalities for chronic Chagas disease, to offer comprehensive care for persons with the disease. A multicriteria analysis was thus performed using the PROMETHEÃ‰ II algorithm, implemented in the Pradin software. The criteria for assessing the model consisted of three indices built from the following indicators: (a) epidemiological, directly related to chronic Chagas disease, (b) related to the evolution in chronic Chagas disease, and (c) related to access to health services. Saaty's Fundamental Scale was used to define the indicators' weights, with greater importance assigned to those directly related to chronic Chagas disease and to those with greater reliability and respective quality of information. Assessment of the models' consistency was based on comparison of the available data in historically endemic areas with the distribution of acute cases, besides other sensitivity analyses. The best model was defined by 1,345 municipalities with medium priority, 1,003 high priority, and 601 with very high priority for chronic Chagas disease, with the highest proportions in the Southeast and Northeast regions. Prioritization allows the administration to rationalize and channel resources, and it is essential to identify the territories where persons with chronic Chagas disease are living, to promote comprehensive care and improve quality of life.
