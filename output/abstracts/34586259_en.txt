The availability of information about population minorities, in this case, the LGBTQIA+ population (Lesbians, Gays, Bisexual, Transvestite/Transsexual, Queer, Intersex, and Asexual), and the possible intersections with other variables on population bases is essential for understanding the similarities and specificities of the reality experienced by these groups, and the establishment of focused public policies. In this sense, this paper aims to reflect on the problems related to research about the sex and gender orientations/performances and, consequently, the lack of information on this topic available in population databases. From the inclusion of the question about sexual orientation in the 2019 National Health Survey database, despite the limitations, this paper presents possible opportunities for investigations on the topic from different perspectives.
