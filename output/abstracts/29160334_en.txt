To establish the speech-language disorders in children living in the western region of SÃ£o Paulo; to assess associations between diagnosis hypotheses (DH) and the age, gender and origin of referral; and to investigate the degree of agreement between the complaint and the DH at the moment of speech-language screening. Observational epidemiological study conducted at a laboratory of Primary Health Care. A survey of 525 medical records of children between 2002 and 2011 was conducted. The following variables were analyzed: gender and age of the child; origin of referral, complaint reported by parents, diagnosis hypothesis and referrals. There was a predominance of male children (68.3%) and of the age group between 3 and 5 years and 11 months (48.7%), referred by a health professional (51.9%) and with more than one complaint reported by parents (26.1%). The most frequent DH were Phonological Disorder (22.9%) and more than one Diagnosis Hypothesis (19.4%). Most children were referred to a clinic-school where screening was performed (77.9%). There was an association between DH and the variables age (p <0.001*), gender (p = 0.008*) and origin of referrals (p <0.001). The degree of agreement between complaints and DHs was moderate. It has been proven that there are different DHs according to age, gender and origin of referrals. The use of speech-language screening with the information provided by parents for tracking of speech pathology is recommended.
