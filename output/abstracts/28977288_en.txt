To evaluate the results of the tests used to identify the IgE mediated sensitization to Aspergillus fumigatus in patients with cystic fibrosis. This is a cross-sectional descriptive study with a convenience sample of 86 patients diagnosed with cystic fibrosis in the Reference Service in Cystic Fibrosis at a tertiary teaching hospital. The following tests were performed to assess the sensitization to A. fumigatus in patients with cystic fibrosis: Total serum IgE, eosinophil count, fungus detection through oropharyngeal swab or sputum culture, serum-specific IgE, and immediate-type hypersensitivity (IgE) skin tests. We compared the results of the different tests performed. In 33 (38.4%) patients with cystic fibrosis, with ages ranging from 1 to 33 years (median of 8 years), the IgE-mediated A. fumigatus sensitization test results were: in 16 patients, there was an increase in serum-specific IgE (>0.35 kU/L); in 23, skin tests were positive; and six had sensitization in both tests. We observed two patients with eosinophilia (>1,000 eosinophils/mm3) and seven with increasing total serum IgE (>1,000 IU/mL), all of whom obtained negative results in skin tests and had no IgE increase specific to A. fumigatus. A. fumigatus was not detected in oropharyngeal swabs and/or sputum culture of any patients. We conclude that, among the tests used to assess sensitization to A. fumigatus in cystic fibrosis patients, both serum-specific IgE and immediate-type hypersensitivity (IgE) skin tests are required. Serum eosinophilia and respiratory secretion culture were not essential in this study.
