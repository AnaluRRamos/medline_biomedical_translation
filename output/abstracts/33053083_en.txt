To test the association between the Sense of Coherence (SOC) and the fear of public speaking in university students. Cross-sectional study was carried out with a sample of 1124 undergraduate students of a Brazilian public university. An online questionnaire was used divided into three blocks: the first evaluated the sociodemographic data and the somatic symptoms of the fear of public speaking; the second evaluated the SOC, through the SOC-13 questionnaire; and the third was composed by the Scale for Self-Assessment in Public Speaking (SSPS), with questions that point out cognitive aspects of this activity. The students were divided into two groups (high SOC and low SOC) through the Two-step Cluster analysis. Data were analyzed descriptively and by the Mann-Whitney test and bi and multivariate logistic regression models, with significance set at 5%. The students who reported not being afraid to speak in public were more likely to belong to the high SOC group (OR = 3.19, 95% CI = 2.30-4.42). Students from the high SOC group self-assessed more positively on the SSPS scale (p <0.001). College students over 30 years old, on the second half of graduation, with breathing discomfort, who do not report fear of public speaking and who perceive themselves more positively for public speaking, they have the highest SOC. Thus, it is observed the importance of considering the SOC as an important coping resource, given the great interference of emotional aspects in public speech.
