The current study aimed to determine whether workgroup identification and alcohol consumption social norms of workgroup moderates the relationship between job demands and alcohol consumption in workers. Regression analysis using the moderated moderation macro in a sample of workers from a telecommunications company in Chile (N = 1,143) supports the hypothesis of moderated moderation: high workgroup identification with with unfavorable social norms of alcohol consumption by the group buffered the relationship between job demands and alcohol consumption of workers (B = -0.080; t = -2.01; p = 0.04; 95%CI: -0.1600; -0.0024), and the high workgroup identification with favorable social norms of alcohol consumption by the group increases the relationship between job demands and alcohol consumption of workers (B = 0.170; t = 2.36; p = 0.01; 95%CI: 0.030; 0.322). The results suggest that strong identification with workgroup and their social norms for alcohol consumption are job resources that can jointly affect or protect workers exposed to heavy work demands. Attention should thus be focused on the potential positive versus harmful effects of these work resources.
