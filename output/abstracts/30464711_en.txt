To identify independent risk factors, complications and early hospital readmission following total knee arthroplasty. Using the ACS-NSQIP database, we identified patients who underwent primary TKA from 2012-2015. The primary outcome was early hospital readmission. Patient demographics, preoperative comorbidities, laboratory data, operative characteristics, and postoperative complications were compared between readmitted and non-readmitted patients. Logistic regression identified independent risk factors for 30-day readmission. 137,209 patients underwent TKA; 3.4% were readmitted within 30 days. Advanced age, male sex, black ethnicity, morbid obesity, presence of preoperative comorbidities, high ASA classification, and increased operative time were independently related risk factors. Asian and no reported race were negative risk factors. Postoperative complications: acute myocardial infarction, acute renal failure, stroke, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and deep vein thrombosis show positive associations. Advanced age, male sex, black ethnicity, morbid obesity, presence of comorbidities, high ASA classification and long operative time are independent risk factors for postoperative complications and early hospital readmission following total knee arthroplasty. <b><i>Level of Evidence III, Case control study.</i></b>
