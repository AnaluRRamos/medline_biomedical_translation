Disciplinary actions may have a significant impact in medical doctors' and patients' lives. The objective of this study was the assessment of the disciplinary actions in Obstetrics and Gynecology that occurred in the north of Portugal in years 2008 to 2012. Retrospective descriptive study based on the anonymized data contained in the annual activity reports of Conselho Disciplinar da Seção Regional Norte da Ordem dos Médicos from 2008 to 2012. We calculated the proportion of disciplinary actions in Obstetrics and Gynaecology over the total number of registered specialists in that speciality. We also analysed the type of complainers, accused, institutions, complaints and decisions. For statistical inference proportions with 95% confidence intervals were estimated. From years 2008 to 2012, we registered 1040 complaints in all medical specialities in the north of Portugal. Obstetrics and Gynecology was the forth most affected specialty, with a total of 54 complaints. Forty-three complaints were related with medical malpractice and if we only consider this type of complaint Obstetrics and Gynecology was the most affected specialty. The most frequent complainers and accused were, respectively, patients themselves and female physicians, with 41 to 60 years of age. Fifty-two complaints were archived without punishment while two still await conclusion. The overall results of this study are in agreement with those reported by other authors. Obstetrics and Gynecology was the forth speciality with highest risk for any disciplinary action in the north of Portugal in years 2008 to 2012 and the first one in relation with alleged negligence. All presented and already concluded complaints were archived without penalty, except two that are still under evaluation.
