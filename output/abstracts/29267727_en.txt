The scope of this article is to analyze the influence of hospitalizations by infectious diseases (diarrhea and pneumonia) and parasitism in nutritional evolution, over the period of a year, among children enrolled in municipal public day care centers. Mothers of children in a cohort were asked about previous hospitalization due to diarrhea and pneumonia, as well as in relation to the elimination of worms, during the period of one year of attendance at day care centers. Anthropometrics were measured at each visit. An adjusted model to examine the relationship between infections experienced and growth outcomes (weight and height) was applied. In a subset analysis of 269 children followed up at every visit over the course of 12 months, hospitalization due to pneumonia and parasite infection were associated with decelerated growth in weight and height. Parasitic infection and pneumonia were associated with growth impairment in terms of weight and height.
