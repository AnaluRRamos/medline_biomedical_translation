The aim of this study was to assess the impact of oral health on the quality of life of patients with head and neck cancer after radiotherapy, combined or not with chemotherapy, and to compare it with that ofpatients with no history of neoplasia. A total 75 individuals were evaluated, including 30 with head and neck cancer after radiotherapy (study group) and 45 with no history of cancer (control group). All patients were evaluated according to World Health Organization criteria: caries activity by DMTF index, presence of periodontal disease by CPI index, edentulism index and impact of oral condition on quality of life through the OHIP-14 questionnaire. Statistically significant differences were found between the study group (SG) and the control group (CG)for caries activity conditions (p <0. 001), periodontal disease (p <0. 001) and missing teeth (p <0. 001). These conditions had an average impact on the quality of life of cancer patients. The oral health condition of individuals with head and neck cancer deteriorates after radiotherapy, with direct impact on their quality of life.
