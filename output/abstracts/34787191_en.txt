An analysis of the national implementation of Regional Reference Centers (RRCs) was carried out. A survey with 97 open-ended and closed-ended questions was answered by the coordinators of 51 RRCs from the five Brazilian regions. A multi-case ex-post-facto study was facilitated by the triangulation of descriptive statistical analysis of closed-ended questions and thematic analysis of open-ended ones. The effective national scope of the RRCs was based on the increased capillarity of public education institutions. Methodological flexibility was highlighted as a convenient feature in the course design, allowing content relevant to the local reality, with proposed intervention projects in the territory, affecting the coordination of the intersectoral network on drugs. Worth highlighting was the need for higher administrative and financial autonomy and the relevance of continuity of the training processes due to the critical role of RRCs in local and regional drug policies. The analysis flags axes that can support the construction of indicators for the evaluation of alcohol and other drugs educational processes, as well as the elaboration of training principles and guidelines for this area.
