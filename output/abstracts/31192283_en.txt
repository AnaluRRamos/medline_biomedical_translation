Vitamin D deficiency is more common in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients than in the general population. However, there are conflicting data about predictive factors of vitamin D deficiency and its potential association with disease activity. The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence and predictive factors of vitamin D deficiency and to evaluate a possible association with disease activity. A prospective observational study was conducted, including patients with IBD from January to July 2016. The Endocrine Society guidelines were considered for defining levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH-D) as follows: deficient (< 20 ng/mL, < 10 ng/mL being severe deficiency), insufficient (21-29 ng/mL), and adequate (> 30 ng/mL). A total of 152 patients (52% men; 47.2 ± 17.3 years) were included, of whom 70% had Crohn's disease (CD). Thirty-seven percent of patients were on immunosuppressors and 17% were on biologics. The majority were outpatients (88.2%). Mean 25-OH-D levels were 17.1 ± 8 ng/mL (CD: 16.7 ± 8 ng/mL vs. ulcerative colitis: 17.6 ± 7 ng/mL, <i>p</i> = 0.1). Inadequate levels were present in 90.8% of patients (deficiency: 68.4%; insufficiency: 22.4%). A significant negative correlation between 25-OH-D levels and age (<i>r</i> = -0.2, <i>p</i> = 0.04), C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (<i>r</i> = -0.22, <i>p</i> = 0.004), and Harvey-Bradshaw index (HBi) (<i>r</i> = -0.32, <i>p</i> = 0.001) was found. Patients with severe deficiency showed a higher CRP (0.6 vs. 1.4 mg/dL, <i>p</i> = 0.03), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (22 vs. 31 mm/h, <i>p</i> = 0.03), and HBi (2 vs. 5, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and lower hemoglobin (13.6 vs. 12.7 g/dL, <i>p</i> = 0.02). There was no association between vitamin D deficiency and gender, type, extent, and duration of disease, surgery, and other measures of disease activity, such as ESR, hemoglobin (these 2 items except for severe deficiency), fecal calprotectin, or Truelove and Witts classification. There is a high prevalence of inadequate levels of vitamin D in IBD patients, particularly deficiency (68.4%). There seems to exist an association between lower levels of vitamin D and higher disease activity, especially in CD.
