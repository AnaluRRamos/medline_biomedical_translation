The study aimed to identify multiple exposures to the risk of work absenteeism among Brazilian schoolteachers, independently of the reasons reported by teachers (n = 6,510). The data came from a telephone survey on health, working conditions, and absenteeism among schoolteachers in Brazil (Educatel Study, 2015/2016). Exposures were identified and studied by principal components analysis and Poisson regression, with a focus on working conditions and quality of school administration. Three components of risk factors for work absenteeism were identified. Component 1 featured lack of opportunities for new learning experiences, insufficient time for performing tasks, constraints on teachers' autonomy, and little or no social support in the school environment; component 2 was characterized by the perception of heavy demand from tasks and an agitated classroom environment due to students' lack of discipline and intense noise; and component 3 by the experience of verbal or physical violence from students. All three components were specially associaed with stress-related work absenteeism in relation to reported stress at school (aPR = 3.87; 95%CI: 2.93-5.10; p < 0.05/aPR = 3.18; 95%CI: 2.47-4.09; p < 0.05/aPR = 3.31; 95%CI: 2.58-4.25; p < 0.05; respectively) and emotional problems (aPR = 2.28; 95%CI: 1.93-2.70; p < 0.05/aPR = 2.43; 95%CI: 2.05-2.87; p < 0.05/aPR = 2.09; 95%CI: 1.78-2.45; p < 0.05; respectively). The identification of these risk components highlighted the need for systemic changes in Brazilian Basic Education schools.
