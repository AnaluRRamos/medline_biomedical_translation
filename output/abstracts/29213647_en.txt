No Brazilian version of a specific scale for evaluating apathy in dementia is available. To introduce a translated version of the Apathy Scale (AS) for use with caregivers. The instrument was formally translated and then administered to the caregivers of a small sample of dementia patients, in order to assess scale comprehensibility and make final adjustments. The scale was subsequently administered to the caregivers of a second, independent sample of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. The content validity of the scale was tested by correlating the AS scores with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) - apathy sub-score and Disability Assessment in Dementia (DAD) total scores. The first sample consisted of eleven subjects with dementia, most of whom had AD. The second sample comprised twenty patients with probable or possible AD (10 with mild dementia), a mean age of 84.1±5.8 years, and 2.2±1.6 years of schooling. The AS scores correlated with both NPI-apathy sub-score (r=0.756, p=0.001) and DAD total scores (r=-0.793, p=0.0005). The final version had good comprehensibility and correlated strongly with standardized apathy and functional activities of daily living measures.
