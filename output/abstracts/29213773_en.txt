Post-traumatic headache (PTH) is the most common symptom found in the post-traumatic syndrome, whose onset occurs within seven days of the trauma. The condition is characterized as acute when it persists for up to 3 months. PTH beyond this period is considered chronic. The objective of this study was to determine the clinical features of chronic post-traumatic headache (cPTH) and its association with depression, anxiety and quality of life. A total of 73 female subjects were evaluated. Patients were divided into three groups: (a) group without headache, CONTROL, n=25; (b) cPTH group, n=19; and (c) MIGRAINE, n=29, with all subjects in the 11-84 year age group. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were evaluated by the Beck inventories of anxiety and depression, and quality of life assessed by the Lipp and Rocha quality of life inventory. Qualitative variables were analyzed using the Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests and expressed as percentages whereas quantitative variables were analyzed by ANOVA, Mann-Whitney or Kruskal-Wallis tests with data expressed as meanÂ±standard deviation, p<0.05. Subjects with cPTH presented with headache manifesting similar features to those found in migraine. The cPTH group was associated with similar levels of anxiety and depression to the migraine group and higher than the CONTROL (p<0.001). Quality of life of individuals with cPTH was similar to that of subjects with migraine and lower than CONTROL subjects (p<0.05). cPTH presents similar clinical characteristics to migraine. Subjects with cPTH had high levels of anxiety and depression symptoms and reduced quality of life.
