This review aimed to analyze the use of differential validation of nursing diagnosis. Integrative literature review with search on international databases. The diagnoses, the type of the diagnosis differential validation, the sample, the method, main results, and the limitations were extracted. Ten studies were included. Differential diagnostic validation publication dates from 1994, and Brazil was the predominant country. This method seems helpful in improving diagnosis accuracy, particularly those related to subjective, behavioral, or complex human responses. Using this model may facilitate understanding the specificity of nursing diagnosis, which is critical for teaching clinical reasoning and for new opportunities to research.
