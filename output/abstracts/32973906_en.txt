To detect the presence of the <i>ermB</i> gene associated with macrolide resistance in <i>Campylobacter spp.</i> strains isolated from chickens marketed in Lima, Peru. 120 samples of chicken skin from three markets in the districts of San Martin de Porres (n = 30), Santa Anita (n = 20), and Independencia (n = 70), located in the Province of Lima, Peru, were analyzed. Microbiological analysis of the samples was carried out according to ISO standard 10272-1:2017. For the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmation of genus and species, 16-rRNA and GlyA and hipO primers, respectively, were used. For the evaluation of antibiotic sensitivity, the Müller-Hinton agar with 5% blood, with sensi-discs for azithromycin (15 µg) and erythromycin (15 µg), was used. For detection of the <i>ermB</i> gene in strains with resistant phenotypes, conventional PCR was used. A total of 117 positive samples (97.5%) were obtained; of these, 100% were compatible with <i>Campylobacter coli</i> (negative hippurate test) and confirmed by PCR. The plate-based assessment of antibiotic resistance to azithromycin and erythromycin resulted in 100% of strains with a phenotype that is resistant to these macrolides, while the PCR to detect the <i>ermB</i> gene indicated a total of 62 positives (53%), which were confirmed through sequencing. These results demonstrate that the chicken carcasses sold in markets in Lima present contamination by <i>C. coli</i> with high resistance to macrolides, which can be attributed to the presence of the <i>ermB</i> gene.
