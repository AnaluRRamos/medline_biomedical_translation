To evaluate the added value of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in the preoperative assessment of myometrial invasion in endometrial cancer, in comparison with T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). This was a retrospective study involving 44 women with endometrial cancer who underwent preoperative 1.5 T MRI. Two radiologists, both of whom were blinded to the histopathology reports, performed a consensus interpretation of the depth of myometrial invasion and of the stage of the cancer, considering three sets of sequences: T2WI, DCE-MRI+T2WI, and DWI+T2WI. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were calculated for each set. The accuracy was compared with <i>p</i>-value adjustment by the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. Among the 44 patients evaluated, DWI+T2WI demonstrated better diagnostic performance in assessing deep myometrial invasion and correctly staged more patients (n = 41) than did DCE-MRI+T2WI (n = 34) and T2WI (n = 22). The superior diagnostic accuracy of DWI+T2WI was statistically significant in comparison with T2WI (<i>p</i> < 0.05) but not in comparison with DCE-MRI+T2WI (<i>p</i> > 0.05). The addition of DWI apparently improves the diagnostic accuracy of MRI in the preoperative assessment of the depth of myometrial invasion in endometrial cancer, which may be particularly helpful in patients for whom contrast agents are contraindicated.
