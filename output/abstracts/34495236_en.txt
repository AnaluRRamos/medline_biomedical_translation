Hyperuricemia is a frequent finding in patients with arterial hypertension, and there is increasing evidence that this entity is also a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. In the context of an aging population, this study aims to evaluate serum uric acid levels and arterial hypertension prevalence and control in a subgroup of Romanian adults (>65 years), concerning the influence of age on these parameters. The study sample consists of 1,920 adults included in SEPHAR III survey, of whom 447 were elderly patients (>65 years of age). During the two study visits, three blood pressure (BP) measurements were performed at 1-min intervals and serum uric acid levels, kidney function by estimated glomerular filtration rate, blood pressure, and intima media thickness measurements were conducted. Hypertension and controls were defined according to the current guidelines. Intima-media thickness evaluation was assessed by B-mode Doppler ultrasound evaluation. A significance level p < 0.05 was adopted for the statistical analysis. Adult patients had a significant lower serum uric acid levels, compared to elderly patients, regardless of glomerular filtration rate levels. Adult patients showed a significantly lower intima-media thickness levels, when compared to elderly patients. Similar to previous studies, in the present study, age represented one of the factors contributing to the increased level of serum uric acid. An increasing prevalence of arterial hypertension with age, together with a poor control of blood pressure, was also obtained.
