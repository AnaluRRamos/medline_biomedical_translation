The identified labels were 16,456 (7,084 men and 9,372 women); average of 1.7 labels per case of care; Out of 216 labels proposed by NANDA-I, in its 2012-14 classification, 152 were used, representing 70.4%. The labels with the highest incidence rates per thousand inhabitants were: Anxiety, Willingness to Improve Knowledge and Risk of Infection. the study allowed detecting, through NANDA-I, the answers to the health problems of greater incidence in the users attended.
