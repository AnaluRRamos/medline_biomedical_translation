Canine atopic dermatitis (cAD) is a common chronic relapsing pruritic skin disease for which management commonly relies on life-long use of immunomodulatory drugs. A number of the medications used are associated with adverse effects and the potential for complications during long-term use. The goal of the study was to determine if a complete and balanced diet formulated for therapeutic benefit could contribute towards management of cAD. We hypothesised that the diet would reduce pruritus while also reducing the requirement for medication during the study period. Forty privately owned dogs, having undergone a comprehensive diagnosis for cAD, were randomly allocated to two groups, each group being fed one of two diets (test or control) for up to nine months. We assessed pruritus, Canine Atopic Dermatitis Extent and Severity Index-(4th iteration) and medication score, the latter reflecting the medication required to maintain a satisfactory quality of life for the animal. Both diets were well-accepted and -tolerated. There was a significant improvement in the pruritus score after three months of feeding the therapeutic diet (P = 0.0001). No such improvement was observed at any time point in the group of dogs given the control diet. There was a reduced drug requirement for dogs receiving the therapeutic diet after three months (P = 0.058), and that decrease was significant at six months (P = 0.021) and nine months (P = 0.018). No improvement was seen at any time point in the control group. The results suggest that a novel therapeutic diet can assist in the management of cAD by helping to control pruritus and reducing reliance on medication.
