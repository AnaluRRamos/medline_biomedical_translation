The National Health Promotion Policy (PNPS) is based on the broadened concept of health and presents the promotion of health as a set of strategies and ways of promoting health, both individually and collectively with responsibilities for the three federated entities. The scope of this study was to develop an evaluability assessment of the PNPS. It is a qualitative-based evaluability assessment conducted in a health region in the Brazilian Northeast in the year 2013. Participants in the study were 18 key informants directly involved in PNPS implementation, of which eight are municipal health secretaries, six are coordinators of primary health care, two are coordinators of epidemiological surveillance, a general regional coordinator and a regional primary care coordinator. The semi-structured interview and the legal documents of the policy were used for gathering information from 2006 to 2012. The construction of the logical model made it possible to reflect on the possible influences of the context on the PNPS implementation. The results showed that PNPS is not yet sufficiently established in the health region and pointed to the need to incorporate specific monitoring and evaluation instruments for this policy.
