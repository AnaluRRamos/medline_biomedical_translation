Currently, there is insufficient evidence to confirm oral diphenhydramine (DPH) efficacy to prevent mast cell degranulation and histamine release in dogs. To determine and compare the effects oral of DPH and cetirizine on the immediate- and late-phase cutaneous allergic reactions in healthy dogs. Twelve healthy laboratory beagle dogs. The study was designed as a randomized, double-blinded crossover study in which each dog served as its own control; twice-daily oral DPH (2.2 mg/kg) or cetirizine (2 mg/kg) were given for six days with a two week washout period. Intradermal injections of histamine, compound 48/80 (positive control) and saline (negative control) were performed on the right thorax 10 days before drug administration (baseline), during oral antihistamine administration on Day 6 and 10 days after last medication dosage. Global wheal scores (GWS) at 20 min and late-phase reactions (LPR) at 6 h post-injection were evaluated by an investigator blinded to the drug and the interventions. Treatment with cetirizine significantly reduced histamine and compound 48/80 GWS and LPR compared to baseline; there was no significant difference for DPH. In all dogs, oral DPH and cetirizine reached plasma concentrations considered therapeutic in people. No adverse effect or behavioural changes were observed during the study. In conclusion, oral cetirizine was effective in preventing cutaneous allergic reactions without any obvious adverse effects in dogs. Oral DPH failed to show an inhibitory effect despite attaining plasma drug concentrations that are considered effective in people.
