Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are neurodegenerative disorders that result in a significant burden to both patients and caregivers. By 2050, the number of people with dementia in Latin America will increase 4-fold. A deep understanding of the relevant genetic factors of AD and FTD is fundamental to tackle this reality through prevention. A review of different genetic variants that cause AD or FTD in Latin America was conducted. We searched Medline and PubMed databases using the keywords 'Alzheimer's disease,' 'frontotemporal dementia,' 'mutation,' 'America,' and 'Latin America,' besides specific Latin American countries. Forty-five items were chosen and analyzed. <i>PSEN1</i> mutations are the commonest cause of genetic early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD), followed by <i>PSEN2</i> and <i>APP</i> mutations. Genetic FTD can be mainly explained by <i>GRN</i> and <i>MAPT</i> mutations, as well as <i>C9orf72 G4C2</i> repeat expansion. <i>APOE</i> Îµ4 can modify the prevalence and incidence of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), in addition to the cognitive performance in affected carriers.
