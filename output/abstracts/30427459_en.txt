This article addresses the social and environmental aspects related to the presence of phosphorus in surface water bodies, assessing the impacts caused by the utilization of powder detergents on the quality and availability of water resources, with particular respect to the occurrence of eutrophication. Based on data concerning the composition and consumption of the products currently sold in Brazil, the evolution of this phenomenon leading to the current situation is reported. Indications are that Brazilian detergents have a low phosphorus content, thus it is possible to infer that these products offer a small risk of impacting the trophic levels of surface waters. There is, however, a need to adjust the content of legislation to market practices, as well as improve public policies related to environmental education. By means of an intensive process of communication and education, awareness about the issue can be raised, keeping this major source of phosphorus in the environment under control and contributing to the increase in the availability of water, through the prevention of eutrophication processes.
