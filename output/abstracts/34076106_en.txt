The work of Community Health Workers (ACS) was analyzed in light of Communities of Practice (CP) theory. This is a qualitative cross-sectional study carried out in four municipalities in Cear√°. Six focus groups and six interviews were carried out with 45 Community Health Workers (ACS), observing ethical aspects. The data corpus was analyzed using the content analysis technique. The results show that ACS participation in the ESF is marked by experience in the community, and the main focus is monitoring priority groups. The practices put them before the diverse social and family complexities, generating reflections and building new meanings for themselves and their work process. The ACS CPs engage and share challenges and unique learning from work, characterized by close contact and relationships with the families of the territory, which reveals needs hardly perceived by other ESF professionals. The meaning of being ACS as one who listens, embraces, and perceives the needs of families invisible to services, is evident in the reification processes. The ACS better exercise their role as ESF articulators in the territories the greater the spaces for dialogue between them, the other team members, and management.
