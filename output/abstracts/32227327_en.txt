Several factors trigger the development of genetic mutations that are responsible for causing a neoplasm. Medulloblastoma is a malignant and invasive cerebellar neoplasm, that affects children and young adults. Mucinous carcinoma is a special type of breast cancer. Being a special atypical subtype of invasive carcinoma, it most frequently affects women of advanced age and represents 1 to 7% of all breast cancers. The reported case aims to show the rarity of the occurrence of desmoplastic medulloblastoma and mammary mucinous carcinoma in a young patient in a short period of time, in different sites, without direct anatomical attachment and without occurrence of metastasis. Initially, this patient had a desmoplastic medulloblastoma and was treated with lumpectomy and radiotherapy. After 13 months, the patient was diagnosed with a mucinous breast carcinoma, underwent mastectomy, adjuvant chemotherapy and is currently undergoing endocrinotherapy. We conclude, based on the metachronous characteristic of the neoplasia and clinical characteristics, that the patient is likely to have Li-Fraumeni syndrome, an autosomal dominant disease with mutation of the TP53 gene, which is the the main involved. Because the patient does not present all the characteristics of the phenotype of the syndrome, she can thus be classified as having Li-Fraumeni variant or Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome.
