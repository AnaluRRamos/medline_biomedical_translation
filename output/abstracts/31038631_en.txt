to identify which clinical features of heart failure are associated with a greater chance of functional dependence for the basic activities of daily living in hospitalized elderly. cross-sectional study conducted with elderly hospitalized patients. The clinical characteristics of heart failure were assessed by self-report, medical records and scales. Dependency was assessed by the Katz Index. The Fisher's Exact Test was used to analyze associations between the nominal variables, and logistic regression to identify factors associated with dependence. the sample consisted of 191 cases. The prevalence of functional dependence was 70.2%. Most of the elderly were partially dependent (66.6%). Clinical characteristics associated with dependence at admission were dyspnea (Odds Ratio 8.5, Confidence Interval 95% 2.668-27.664, p <0.001), lower limb edema (Odds Ratio 5.7, 95% Confidence Interval 2.148-15.571, p <0.001); cough (Odds Ratio 9.0, 95% confidence interval 1.053-76.938, p <0.045); precordial pain (Odds Ratio 4.5, 95% confidence interval 1.125-18.023, p <0.033), and pulmonary crackling (Odds Ratio 4.9, 95% Confidence Interval 1.704-14.094, p <0.003). functional dependence in admitted elderly patients with heart failure is more associated with congestive signs and symptoms.
