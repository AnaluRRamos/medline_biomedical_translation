This work is part of a larger survey on how Roberto Freire's somatherapy emerged and developed from the counterculture of the 1970s, addressing the creation and initial development of somatherapy, starting from what is understood to be a 'creation myth,' an orderly and coherent narrative explaining the emergence of this therapy that is frequently repeated with few changes. Later narratives referring to the process of naming somatherapy are also examined, revealing inconsistencies and conflicts in the data that indicate the complexity of these processes and the authors' efforts to add order and legitimacy to this therapeutic technique.
