One of the first steps to be taken in order to reduce lesions in sports, such as stress fractures, is to know the nature and extension of this pathology. What follows is a case report of segmental stress fracture of the tibia in recreational athletes, which is considered somewhat rare in the literature. Case report: a 40-year-old female patient who started to have follow-up medical checks due to unusual pain in her right leg, concentrated mainly on the proximal region of the knee and ankle, after a 10-km run for a period of one month. Segmental stress fracture of the tibia was diagnosed after clinical research and further examinations.
