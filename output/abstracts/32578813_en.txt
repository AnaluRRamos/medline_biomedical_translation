To investigate the metabolic/inflammatory impact of reducing the preoperative fasting time in preschool children. Forty children were randomly assigned to a fasting group (absolute fasting after 00:00) and a carbohydrate (CHO) group (allowed to ingest, two hours before surgery, a carbohydrate-rich beverage). Blood samples were collected right before and after surgery to quantify the levels of albumin, interleukin-6, glucose, insulin, C-reactive protein and to calculate insulin resistance by the HOMA-IR index. Preoperative fasting time in the CHO group were shorter than in the fasting group (2.49h vs. 11.24h, p <0.001). Pre- and post-surgical CRP levels were significantly lower in the CHO group (p = 0.05 and p = 0.02, respectively). The preoperative CRP/albumin ratios in the CHO group were lower than in the fasting group (p = 0.03). Four patients (21%) in the fasting group but none in the CHO group were hyperglycemic before surgery (p = 0.04). The two groups had similar levels of albumin, interleukin-6, insulin and HOMA index. There were no adverse events. Reducing the preoperative fasting time with carbohydrate-rich beverages improves the perioperative metabolic and inflammatory responses of preschool children undergoing inguinal hernia surgery.
