To analyze the correlation between municipalities adhering to the Health Fitness Center Program, noncommunicable chronic disease (NCD) hospitalizations and socioeconomic levels from 2011 to 2017. This was an ecological study; HFCP adherence indicators for 2,837 municipalities were calculated, as were NCD hospitalization indicators, according to funding categories and the Firjan Socioeconomic Development Index. The HFCP adherence indicator was higher for municipalities that received Congress funding (1.18), had moderate to high Firjan Socioeconomic Development Indices (0.94) and high NCD hospitalization indicators (1.03) (p<0.001). There were positive correlations (p<0.05) between the two indicators in municipalities receiving Ministry of Health funding (r=0.14) and those receiving both Congress and Ministry of Health funding (r=0.12); whereas correlation was negative in municipalities with moderate to low Firjan Socioeconomic Development Indices (r=-0.09; p=0.013). The main form of adherence to the HFCP, according to population size, was through Congress funding. Municipalities with poorer socioeconomic and NCD indicators had lower adherence to the HFCP.
