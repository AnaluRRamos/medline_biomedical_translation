: The objective was to identify predictors of pain in the elderly. This was a longitudinal population-based study using home interviews with elderly residing in the city of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, and participating in the SABE Study in 2006 and 2010. Analysis of predictors of pain used hierarchical logistic regression, based on a theoretical-conceptual model with distal, intermediate, and proximal variables. Accumulated pain incidence was 27.9%. After adjustments, predictors of pain in the elderly were: 0 to 3 years of schooling (OR = 2.21; 95%CI: 1.18-4.15), arterial hypertension (OR = 1.98; 95%CI: 1.24-2.88), unsatisfactory family Apgar (OR = 2.31; 95%CI: 1.15-4.64), and bad/fair self-rated health (OR = 2.23; 95%CI: 1.3-3.69). Identification of these predictors can serve as an alert to health teams providing care to the elderly and may suggest possible measures in the prevention and detection of pain in order to avoid its chronification and consequences.
