Through an integrative literature review involving the CINAHL, Cochrane, Embase, LILACS, PsycINFO, PubMed databases, tools available in the literature for assessing pain in individuals with severe dementia were identified along with versions validated for use in Brazil. We found 1501 relevant articles which, after selection of abstracts and full reading, yielded a final sample of 33 articles. The analysis enabled the identification of 12 instruments: ABBEY PAIN SCALE; ADD; CNPI; CPAT; DOLOPLUS-2; MOBID and MOBID-2; MPS; NOPPAIN; PACSLAC; PADE; PAINAD and PAINE. Despite the wide variety of tools for assessing pain in individuals with severe dementia worldwide, it was observed that only four are available in Portuguese, of which two are culturally adapted for Brazilian Portuguese (NOPPAIN and PACSLAC) and two validated for Portuguese of Portugal (DOLOPLUS and PAINAD), pointing to the need for further validation of instruments for use in Brazil.
