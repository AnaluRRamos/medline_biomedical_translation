The objective of this study was to analyze the use and access to medications for type 2 diabetes among older people registered in the family health strategy in Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo. A population-based household survey was undertaken with 338 older adults selected using two-stage cluster sampling. Pharmacotherapy of diabetes and access to medications was investigated using a structured questionnaire administered by means of face-to-face interviews. The number of medicines used to treat diabetes ranged between 1 and 4. Respondents predominantly used only oral antidiabetic agents. The use of metformin and sulfonylureas on their own was reported by 37.9% and 9.8% of respondents, respectively. Frequency of insulin use was greatest in the 80 years and overage group (38.9%). The large majority of respondents (96.4%) had full access to medicines. Means of payment was 'free of charge' in 78.1% of the respondents and public pharmacies were the main source of medication (74.8%). The most commonly used oral antidiabetic was metformin, which is consistent with current treatment guidelines. However, the findings show inappropriate medication use among older people, more specifically the use of sulfonylureas on their own. The findings of this study highlight the important role played by the public health service in providing medications for type 2 diabetes.
