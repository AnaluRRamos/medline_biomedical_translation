To evaluate the profile of patients with osteoporotic fractures treated at a tertiary orthopedic hospital. Using questionnaires, 70 patients with osteoporotic fractures (OF) were compared with 50 outpatients with multiple osteoarthritis (OA) followed through an outpatient clinic. The OF group was older (p <0.001), less heavy (p=0.003), had lower BMI (p=0.006), was more likely to be white (p=0.011), was less likely to be married (p=0.008), and had previous falls, previous fractures, old fractures (>1 year), falls in the last 12 months, fractures due to falls, and needed more assistance (p<0.05). They also had lower Lawton & Brody Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scores (p <0.05) and reported less lower limb disability, foot pathology, muscle weakness, hypothyroidism, and vitamin D intake than patients in the OA group. White race, previous falls, and previous fractures increase the risk of osteoporotic fractures by 10.5, 11.4, and 4.1 times, respectively. The chance of fracture dropped 29% for each one-unit increase in Lawton & Brody IADL score. Married participants had fewer fractures than participants with other marital status. Together, race, marital status, previous falls, foot pathologies, previous fractures, and IADL scores define the profile of patients with osteoporotic fractures. Level of Evidence III; Case control study.
