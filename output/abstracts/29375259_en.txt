To compare quality of life (according to the SF-12) in patients with rotator cuff arthropathy with controls paired by sex and age. Secondary objectives are to compare the groups according to the ASES and VAS scales. This cross-sectional study with controls paired by sex and age compared patients with rotator cuff arthropathy with surgical indication for reverse shoulder arthroplasty. The groups were compared according to the SF-12, ASES, and VAS scales. The groups consisted of 38 individuals, 28 women. The SF-12 demonstrated a significant difference in the physical component, with the cases scoring 31.61 ± 6.15 and the controls 49.39 ± 6.37 (p<0.001). For the mental component, the difference was not significant, with the cases scoring 44.82 ± 13.18 and the controls 48.96 ± 8.65 (p=0.109). The cases scored 7.34 ± 2.11 on the VAS and 31.26 ± 15.12 on the ASES, while the controls scored 0.55 ± 1.31 and 97.53 ± 6.22, respectively (p<0.001). Patients with rotator cuff arthropathy had poorer results for the physical component of the SF-12 than the controls. They also had poorer functional results according to the ASES scale, and more pain according to the VAS. <b>Level of Evidence III, Case Control Study.</b>
