The Rede Cegonha strategy was launched in 2011 by the federal government to improve pregnancy, delivery, postpartum care, and child development in the first two years of life, reduce maternal and child mortality, and expand women's sexual and reproductive rights. We propose seven new maternal indicators to improve obstetric care evaluation in the next assessment cycle. The new indicators are the use of Robson's classification to monitor cesarean rates, use of magnesium sulfate in cases of preeclampsia/eclampsia, pregnant women's use of calcium supplements, blood transfusions and hysterectomy in delivery/puerperium, management of puerperal sepsis, IUD insertions in the postpartum/post-abortion period, and obstetricians' continuing education. These indicators are based on robust scientific evidence and can reduce unnecessary cesarean sections, prevent maternal deaths and future unplanned pregnancies.
