To put forward an anatomical description of the innervation of the elbow capsule, illustrated through morphological analysis on dissections. Thirty elbows from fresh fixed adult cadavers aged 32-74 years, of both sexes, were dissected. Among the dissected arms, we observed that the median nerve did not have any branches in two arms, while it had one branch in five arms, two branches in two arms, three branches in ten arms, four branches in nine arms and five branches in two arms. The radial nerve did not have any branches in two arms, while it had one branch in two arms, two branches in nine arms, three branches in ten arms, four branches in five arms and five branches in two arms. The ulnar nerve did not have any branches in three arms, while it had one branch in six arms, two branches in four arms, three branches in five arms, four branches in seven arms, five branches in four arms and six branches in one arm. We observed branches of the radial, ulnar and medial nerves in the elbow joint, and a close relationship between their capsular and motor branches.
