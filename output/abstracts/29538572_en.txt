This article aims to evaluate accessibility to health services from the perspective of the elderly in a city of Northeast Brazil. Socioeconomic and demographic data were collected, and the organizational, socio-cultural and economic accessibility to services offered by the Family Health Strategy (FHS) was assessed. A validated instrument adapted for the elderly population was used to assess the FHS by users in cities in Para√≠ba. The association of socioeconomic and demographic variables with accessibility was assessed. For organizational accessibility, the elderly of lower economic classes were more likely to give a positive evaluation regarding the opening hours for care, and less likely to give a positive assessment in relation to the amount of people attended per day and the ease to obtain medication. Women were more likely to positively evaluate the consultation with experts (economic accessibility). The evaluation of the elderly shows the existence of barriers, especially in organizational accessibility, which still persist regarding the demand and use of health services.
