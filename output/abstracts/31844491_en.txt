Functional capacity (FC) is a mediator between neuropsychological functions and real-world functioning, but there is a lack of evidence of its correlation in community-dwelling older adults. The study aim was to determine the FC level of community-dwelling older adults using the UCSD Performance-based Skills Assessment (UPSA) and to evaluate correlation with cognitive screening tests. Senior center participants were selected according to inclusion criteria: Portuguese fluency, age â‰¥60 years and self-reported independent living. The subject exclusion criteria were: dementia or other DSM-5 diagnoses, suicidal ideation or intent, non-completion of assessment battery, enrollment in another psychosocial intervention or pharmacotherapy study. FC level was determined by the UPSA, brief UPSA (UPSA-B) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale (IADL's). The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Memory of Figure Test (MFT), Verbal Fluency Test (VFT) and Clock Drawing Test (CDT) were used for cognitive assessment. A total of 35 subjects that had a mean age of 72 years, were predominantly females(88.6%) and had mean education level of 11.25 years were evaluated. Mean UPSA and UPSA-B scores were 78.5 and 70, respectively. A statistically significant correlation was observed between the UPSA and IADL, MMSE and VFT. The UPSA serves as a screening assessment of FC in community-dwelling older adults, showing a positive correlation with cognitive screening tests.
