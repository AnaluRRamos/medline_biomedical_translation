To evaluate the occupational stress among health workers in a university hospital. Cross-sectional study conducted with health workers in the areas of nursing and medicine at a university hospital in southern Brazil. The data were collected between August of 2011 and August of 2012 by a questionnaire of characterization and Job Stress Scale. A descriptive and univariate analysis was performed (Kruskal-Wallis). The participants presented high demand and high control of the work and low social support, indicating an active work. Nurses had less control over work (p<0.001) and physicians received more social support (p=0.006). Reduced social support was related to greater exposure to stress among nursing assistants and technicians (p=0.012). Workers who felt the low social support had higher exposure to stress. It is necessary to implement stress prevention strategies among health workers, such as the strengthening of social support at work.
