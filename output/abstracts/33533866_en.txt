This study investigates the challenges and possibilities of health professionals in managing care for dependent older adults in PHC. We employed a qualitative approach based on dialectical hermeneutic fusion. Interviews were carried out with 38 health professionals, from June to December 2019, in eight cities in the five Brazilian regions, which resulted in themes about the challenges of professionals in the management of care for older adults, the strategies used, and their suggestions for improving the quality of care for dependent older adults. Management failures, structural factors, access barriers, scarce supplies, disrupted network, and lack of security, were pointed out as hardships in directing health protection, prevention, and promotion actions. The applied strategies are diverse and conflicting and aim to articulate the multiprofessional teams, which involve the Family Health Strategy and specialists to implement care. Strengthening reception, encouraging home consultation, mobilizing support groups, and carrying out health education were among the participants' integrative practices. Due to the complex study object, it was evidenced that professionals recognize the shortcomings in the health services and face undesirable situations due to the lack of qualified personnel in the teams and the defective materials and transportation.
