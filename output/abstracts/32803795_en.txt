Respiratory illness is the leading cause of mortality in children with cerebral palsy (CP). Although risk factors for developing chronic respiratory illness have been identified, comprehensive clinical care recommendations for the prevention and management of respiratory illness do not currently exist. We invited over 200 clinicians and researchers from multiple disciplines with expertise in the management of respiratory illness in children with CP to develop care recommendations using a modified Delphi method on the basis of the RAND Corporation-University of California Los Angeles Appropriateness Method. These recommendations are intended for use by the wide range of practitioners who care for individuals living with CP. They provide a framework for recognizing multifactorial primary and secondary potentially modifiable risk factors and for providing coordinated multidisciplinary care. We describe the methods used to generate the consensus recommendations, and the overall perspective on assessment, prevention, and treatment of respiratory illness in children with CP. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: The first consensus statement for preventing and managing respiratory disease in cerebral palsy (CP). Risk factors for respiratory disease in CP should be identified early. Individuals with CP at risk of respiratory disease require regular assessment of risk factors. Effective partnerships between multidisciplinary teams, individuals with CP, and families are essential. Treatment of respiratory disease in individuals with CP must be proactive.
