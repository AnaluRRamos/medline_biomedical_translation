Verbal fluency tests are widely used in neuropsychological assessment. The quantitative and qualitative analysis of the performance of aphasic individuals on the phonemic verbal fluency (PVF) test can contribute to a better understanding of cognitive changes in this group of patients. This study aimed to analyze clustering and switching measures of PVF in people with aphasia and investigate the relationship between the use of these strategies, the quantitative performance on the test, and the performance on executive functions. This is a cross-sectional study of 15 people with aphasia, right-handed, native speakers of Brazilian Portuguese, aged 19 to 92 years. They were submitted to the F-A-S test and the Clock Drawing Test (CDT). The following measures were obtained in the F-A-S test: total score, number of clusters, mean cluster size, and number of switches. Spearman's test was used to analyze correlation. We found a positive correlation among all F-A-S test scores, ranging from p=0.61 (p<0.001) to p=0.91 (p<0.001). No correlation was identified between these measures and CDT performance (p≤0.31; p≥0.260). The quantitative and qualitative analysis of F-A-S in people with aphasia, even those with different linguistic manifestations, showed that these individuals presented lower scores and that the number of total words and the number of switches were strongly correlated. We found no correlation between executive function, assessed by the CDT, and switching performance on the F-A-S test.
