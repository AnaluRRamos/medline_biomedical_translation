Aortic coarctation and bicuspid aortic valve frequently coexist. Correction frequently require an aggressive, invasive approach. Here we present a case of a two-stage minimally invasive intervention without sternotomy to correct aortic coarctation and replace the native bicuspid aortic valve. This case illustrates the potential of minimally invasive procedures with minimal trauma and fast recovery. Besides, it facilitates future cardiac interventions, such as anticipated surgical prosthesis and/or ascending aorta replacement.
