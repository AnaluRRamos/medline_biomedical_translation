The study aimed to analyze the association between excessive alcohol intake and dissatisfaction with one's body image in a population of adolescents and young adults. This was a cross-sectional study with a household survey design in a sample of 1,582 individuals 15 to 24 years of age living in Cama√ßari, Bahia State, Brazil. Excessive alcohol intake was identified by the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT), and dissatisfaction with body image was measure with the Silhouette Figure Scale. Confounding variables were: sex, age, race, schooling, work, religion, family composition, number of close friends, marital status, and children. The association between excessive alcohol intake and body dissatisfaction was estimated by logistic regression. Prevalence of excessive alcohol intake was 21.9% (higher in males), and prevalence of body image dissatisfaction was 79.5% (higher in females). No statistically significant association was found between excessive alcohol intake and dissatisfaction with body image. After adjustment of the final model, the variables that remained associated with excessive alcohol intake were religion (OR = 2.02), schooling (OR = 1.63), family composition (OR = 1.61), age (OR = 0.55), and work (OR = 0.61). Although the analyses did not show an association between excessive alcohol intake and dissatisfaction with body image, the study's results call attention to the high prevalence rates for the two phenomena. This shows the need to develop interventions focused on practices of care for this specific population.
