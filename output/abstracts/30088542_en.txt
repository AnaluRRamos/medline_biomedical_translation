Describing the care management of a patient affected by Devic's Disease in the Primary Health Care setting. A clinical-qualitative case study based on the health status of a Devic's Disease patient in a Health Center of the municipality of Florian√≥polis, accompanied by the Family Health Team. Data collection was carried out by electronic medical records, documents of the patient's domain, as well as a semi-structured interview with the participant. Ethical aspects of research involving human beings were respected. The categories were defined according to relevance criteria with the purpose of reporting the case study, presenting a unique implemented therapeutic project and describing the patient's perception of her situation. Acupuncture and auriculotherapy were successfully performed, evidencing an improvement in the patient's pain, which may contribute to new possibilities of care. Despite this, not all the available care tools were implemented, considering the range of complementary care therapies that go beyond the medicinal approach.
