Translate into Brazilian Portuguese and culturally adapt the component scores definition from the Modified Barium Swallow Impairment Profile - MBSImP videofluoroscopy protocol. This study was conducted based on international guidelines for creation, translation and transcultural adaptation according to domestic publications for the validation of international speech-language pathology tests. A specialist committee was convened with two otorhinolaryngologists and three speech-language pathologists familiar with videofluoroscopy examinations. Translation into Brazilian Portuguese was carried out by two otorhinolaryngologists with subsequent back translation performed independently by two U.S.-born translators. The final Brazilian Portuguese version was written by speech-language pathologists after revision of translations and back translations resolved semantic, idiomatic, conceptual, linguistic and contextual inconsistencies. This version was tested by committee members, who assessed subjects with no disease, with head and neck cancer and with mild cognitive impairment. Translation of the component scores definition from MBSImP was performed independently and translators agreed on a final version. The MBSImP protocol was renamed 'Martin-Harris scale for swallowing videofluoroscopy'. Some terms were adapted for the final Brazilian Portuguese version. Use of the translated protocol did not reveal any deviations from the original. Translation of the MBSImP fragment into Brazilian Portuguese was consistent with the original version. Approval from specialist committee members refined the protocol adaptation, allowing precise concepts to be accurately translated.
