The aim of this study was to analyze, by an integrative review of the literature, the possible impacts of financial crises on oral health indicators in different countries, as well as to verify the measures adopted in order to compare with the Brazilian reality. A search for articles that met these criteria was carried out in PUBMED, EMBASE, Lilacs, SCOPUS and also in the gray literature. At the end, nine studies were included. The results indicate that the population with higher vulnerability, lower income and lower educational level are the most affected, independently of the evaluated indicator (untreated dental caries, access to dental care services and hygiene habits). When protective measures with allocation of financial resources were taken, disparities decreased. It was concluded that, faced with economic crises, oral health is no longer a priority, which impacts access to care for the less favored social strata.
