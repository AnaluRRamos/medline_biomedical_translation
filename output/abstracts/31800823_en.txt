To determine whether nursing students have subtle or blatant prejudices towards migrants. A descriptive ex post facto study was conducted. The sample consisted of 282 students and the study variables were sex, cultural origin, age, year, and contact with migrants. The Subtle and Blatant Prejudice Scale was used. Descriptive and inferential analyses were performed. There were significant differences in the culture variable, with students of Berber origin and of Muslim faith showing less prejudice than those of European origin and of Christian faith. Fourth-year students had the most blatant prejudices. According to the variable contact with migrants, it is the students who have not had contact with this group who have the greatest blatant prejudices. Nursing students have more subtle prejudices rather than blatant prejudices towards the migrant population.
