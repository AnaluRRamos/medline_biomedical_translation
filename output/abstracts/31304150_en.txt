The objective of this study was to measure in MRI scans, the size of the origin, insertion and length of the anterior cruciate ligament and possible graft for reconstruction surgery in case of injury. Besides this, there was a cross between statistical data to test the hypothesis of proportional relationship between these anatomical extent. 52 MRI examinations performed between 2008 and 2011 were valued at random in a longitudinal retrospective epidemiological study. To measure the width of the ACL was used coronal oblique to the length of the sagittal section, for inserting the tibial coronal femoral insertion and was also used oblique coronal section. The average diameter of the ACL was 4.80 mm (3.1-8.3 mm), with a length of 3.8 cm (2.85-4.5 cm). The origin ranged from 9.7 mm to 15.4 mm. The average insertion on the tibia was 13.3 mm. The average diameter of the semi-tendinous was 4.38 mm and the average diameter was 3.42 mm gracilis. The quadriceps presented diameter of 7.67 mm, a length of 35.34 mm and 4.54 mm patellar tendon diameter and 26.62 mm in average length. These data provide important information for the pre-operative surgeon, facilitating preoperative planning and providing viable alternatives and avoiding inadequate grafts.
