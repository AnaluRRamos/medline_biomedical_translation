In order to improve speech-language development in children with hearing impairment, in addition to speech-language therapy, the family should be the modifying agent for a satisfactory therapeutic response. Studies that analyze the effectiveness of speech-language pathology (SLP) intervention programs through video feedback are important, given the positive effects of this tool on the modification of behaviors with families of children with disabilities. Therefore, it is believed that video feedback interventions contribute improve the communicative interactions between the families and children assisted by auditory rehabilitation services. The objectives of this study were to investigate the interaction between families and children with hearing loss and analyze the self-esteem and satisfaction of families before and after the intervention program. This is a non-randomized, clinical trial with case report in two groups: Experimental (n=5) and Control (n=5). The intervention was supported by family-child interaction videos and adapted instruments. Pre- and post-intervention protocols were applied. In the EG, improvement was observed in the interaction between the families and children with hearing loss and in the self-esteem of participants. The EG showed satisfaction with the intervention. We conclude that the SLP intervention program based on video feedback has positive effects on the family/child interaction and on parent self-esteem. Further studies with stricter methodological controls should be conducted to prove the efficacy of video feedback intervention for families of children with hearing loss.
