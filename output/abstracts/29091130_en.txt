To describe a case of cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD) and discuss the importance of liver biopsy for diagnosis. A female patient, aged two years and ten months, presented with an increased abdominal volume following hepatomegaly for four months. Abdominal ultrasound demonstrated hepatomegaly and hepatic steatosis. Laboratory tests showed elevated liver serum enzymes and dyslipidemia. Liver biopsy was consistent with CESD. Although measuring enzyme activity is the gold standard for CESD diagnosis, liver biopsy is very helpful when investigating suspected cases of CESD, particularly upon other differential diagnoses to be considered.
