to evaluate the efficacy of hyaluronic acid in the post-operative of knee arthroscopy. we have evaluated 49 patients undergoing arthroscopic procedure with the use of intra-articular hyaluronic acid (Group 1) and 49 patients undergoing arthroscopic procedure without the use of hyaluronic acid (Group 2). Patients were evaluated based on the Visual Analogue Scale, household analgesia, assessment of the Range of Motion with a goniometer, and the Lysholm questionnaire. there were no substantial adverse effects on either group. the use of hyaluronic acid in the post-operative of knee arthroscopy is justified due/because it leads to a decrease in pain in the early stage, enabling faster recovery of the patient.
