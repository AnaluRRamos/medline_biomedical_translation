To describe a successful surgical treatment for the challenging severe and fixed chin-on-chest deformity due to isolated neck extensor myopathy (INEM). INEM is an idiopathic cause of dropped head syndrome (DHS) that results in severe cervicothoracic kyphosis, defined as chin-on-chest deformity. The existing literature on surgical management is limited, with outcomes ranging from poor to excellent. INEM may present to the spinal surgeon for consideration of surgical management. The authors present a technique that uses a staged posterior and anterior approach combined with osteotomies and corpectomy to correct the severe and fixed deformity. A state of the art anterior and posterior instrumentation system was used. At the three-months follow-up, there was good deformity correction and the patient's satisfaction was high, with no neurological deterioration occurring. The technique illustrated in this study represents a successful option to treat this debilitating deformity. More evidence is needed to set up a definitive algorithm for the management of this condition. <b><i>Level of evidence IV, Case Report.</i></b>
