This study evaluated the impact of COVID-19 on the endodontic treatment routine. It was a cross-sectional study using an online questionnaire applied to endodontists to collect information about practical modifications during endodontic treatment to protect professionals and patients against the COVID-19 outbreak. A total 1105 participants from Brazil participated in the survey. More than 90% of respondents identify the high risk of COVID-19 infection to dentists and the need to change some clinical practices. Most respondents (60.1%) are partially following social isolation. The need for a change in Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) during dental appointments was mentioned by 97.1% of respondents. The use of minimal adequate PPE during the pandemic period was associated with the area of residence and marital status of participants. Only 30% of respondents say they use the minimal adequate PPE. Most respondents will change cavity access preparation to reduce virus dissemination. Other changes in endodontic appointments were described in the survey: greater attention to biosafety measures, duration of dental appointments, and duration of intervals between appointments. Endodontists still need to identify the best arrangement for performing their procedures safely during the COVID-19 pandemic. Specific guidelines require detailed information for each specialty and its procedures.
