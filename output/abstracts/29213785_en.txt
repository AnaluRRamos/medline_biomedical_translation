Stroke is a known cause of cognitive impairment but the relationship between asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis and cognitive function is not clear. The main risk factors for vascular disease are also related to carotid stenosis and cognitive impairment. The association of high-grade stenosis of the internal carotid artery with cognitive impairment is related to silent embolization and hypoperfusion, but it may also be present without evidence of infarction on magnetic resonance imaging. Carotid stenosis treatment may lead to a decline in cognitive function due to complications related to the procedures (endarterectomy or stenting). On the other hand, reperfusion may improve cognitive impairment. The best treatment choice is unclear, considering possible deterioration of cognitive function related to carotid artery stenosis. There is insufficient evidence to consider cognitive impairment an important factor in determining the therapy for carotid stenosis.
