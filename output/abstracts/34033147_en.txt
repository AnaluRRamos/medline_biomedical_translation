Canine cutaneous epitheliotropic T-cell lymphoma (CETL) is associated with a poor prognosis and without consistently beneficial treatment options. This case report describes a 9-year-old Staffordshire bull terrier with CETL treated with oclacitinib (0.7Â mg/kg twice daily), resulting in partial remission that was maintained for three months. Further studies are warranted.
