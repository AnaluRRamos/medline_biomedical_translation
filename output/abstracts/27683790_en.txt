Bariatric surgery has been an alternative when conservative methods of weight loss fail. Patients undergoing bariatric surgery have an increased risk of up to 6.5% of problems related to alcohol. Integrative review out to analyze the change of alcohol consumption in this public. Database was accessed from June of 2015 to January of 2016 by searching 'bariatric surgery' AND 'alcoholism', and their Portuguese equivalents. ScienceDirect, PubMed, Lilacs and Medline, besides manual search, were searched. To be included, the paper should have been published between 2005-2016 and related to bariatric surgery and alcoholism. Theses, dissertations, unpublished papers, case reports and theoretical studies were excluded, and a database was subsequently composed. In 2005 there was only a review of change in alcohol metabolism in patients undergoing bariatric surgery. There were no publications in 2006. In 2007, only one study was published, and it did not meet the inclusion criteria. In 2010, there was an increase of 13% in publications and of 20% in 2012, reaching 40% in 2013. The prevalence and incidence of alcohol consumption in relation to the postoperative time was six months to three years with higher incidence for follow-up treatment by men. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass showed greater association with increased consumption of alcohol during the postoperative period. Alcohol consumption proved to be essential to be faced in bariatric surgery.
