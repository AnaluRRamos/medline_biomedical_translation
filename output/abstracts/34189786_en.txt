Concurrent vasculopathic lesions in dogs with pemphigus foliaceus (PF) have been observed anecdotally yet not reported in the literature. Any association with prognosis is unclear. To compare clinical features and outcome of PF in dogs with and without vasculopathic lesions. Archived, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded biopsy samples of 41 dogs with PF. Archived, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded biopsy samples with a histological diagnosis of PF were selected and re-evaluated independently. Dogs were assigned to groups following histological evaluation: Group 1 (no vasculopathic lesions) and Group 2 (vasculopathic lesions present). Group 2 was subdivided into Group 2a (vasculopathic lesions without vasculitis - i.e. vasculopathy) and Group 2b (overt vasculitis). Medical records from identified cases were reviewed retrospectively for data on clinical presentation, treatment and outcome. Time to remission was longer in Group 2b (93.8 days) compared to Group 1 (41.8 days) (P = 0.047). Dogs in groups 2a and 2b were more likely to have systemic signs of illness at presentation (P = 0.028 and P = 0.032, respectively) compared to Group 1. Dogs in Group 2b were more likely to have adverse effects associated with treatment than dogs in Group 1 (P = 0.004). There were no significant differences in lesion type, distribution, rates of remission, recurrence or corticosteroid dosage between groups. Dogs with PF and concurrent vasculitis took longer to achieve remission and were more likely to have systemic signs of illness or adverse effects associated with treatment than dogs with PF without concurrent vasculopathic lesions.
