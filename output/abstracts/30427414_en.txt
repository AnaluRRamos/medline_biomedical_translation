The process of liver donations and transplants in Brazil reveals major inequalities between regions and states of the country, ranging from uptake of the organs to their transplantation. In 2006, the MELD score (Model for End-stage Liver Disease), inspired by the U.S. model and based on the principle of need, was introduced in Brazil for liver transplant allocation. However, Brazil's inequalities have partially undermined the initiative's success. Other countries have already benefited from growing discussion on the benefits of models that seek to harmonize utilitarianism and need. The current article reviews the relevant literature with a special focus on the Brazilian reality.
