This article contributes to the debate about the medicalization of childbirth in Brazil through a literature review of databases of Brazilian libraries. Its main goal is to enable the systematized availability of specialized scientific publications in gynecology and obstetrics in the twentieth century, especially 1900 to 1950. In view of the importance of the analysis of journals in the development of scientific knowledge in Brazil and the importance of specialized journals in constituting and developing medical specializations, details of these archives are presented, including their location, when they were published, and where they were produced, paying particular attention to the archive in the library of the Teaching Maternity Hospital (Maternidade-Escola) of the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro.
