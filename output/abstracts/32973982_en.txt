Studies suggest that the engagement of aged participants in cognitive stimulation programs can reduce expected cognitive decline associated with age. To evaluate the effects of memory training (MT) associated with three-dimensional multiple object tracking (3D-MOT) NeuroTracker (NT) in the elderly. Forty-four participants (>60 years of age) were recruited and randomly distributed into two groups: experimental (EG; n=22) and comparative (CG; n=22). Both groups performed 12 one-hour MT sessions, twice a week, consisting of specific computerized stimuli associated with teaching of mnemonic strategies; 10 minutes of NT was part only of the EG's sessions. In pre- and post-training periods, both groups were evaluated using a sociodemographic questionnaire, neuropsychological assessment, as well as a specific measure offered by NT. Both groups benefited from the MT and reported more positive feelings regarding their memory and quality of life. However, the EG obtained better results in tests consistent with the strategies trained and which involved attentional resources, reaction time, visual processing speed, episodic, semantic, subjective and working memory as well as aspects of social cognition. This study showed that the combination of MT and 3D-MOT contributed for a better cognitive performance in the EG. Thus, the results of the present study encourage further research and the development of combined cognitive interventions for the elderly population with and without cognitive deficits.
