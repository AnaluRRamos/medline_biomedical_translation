To assess the daily dietary intake and energy contribution of ultra-processed foods among women who are positive and negative for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) during pregnancy.  This case-control study included 77 HIV-positive and 79 HIV-negative puerperal women between 2015 and 2016. The socioeconomic and maternal demographic data were assessed, and a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) adapted for pregnant women was applied. The Fisher exact test and the Mann-Whitney test were applied to detect differences between the groups. Linear regression was used to assess the associations between the intake of ultra-processed food and energy, macro- and micronutrients, with values of <i>p </i>< 0.05 considered significant.  The HIV-positive group was older (<i>p </i>< 0.001) and had lower income (<i>p </i>= 0.016) and level of schooling (<i>p </i>< 0.001) than the HIV-negative group. Both groups presented similar average food intake: 4,082.99 Kcal/day and 4,369.24 Kcal/day for the HIV-positive and HIV-negative women respectively (<i>p </i>= 0.258).The HIV-positive group consumed less protein (<i>p </i>= 0.048), carbohydrates (<i>p </i>= 0.028) and calcium (<i>p </i>= 0.001), and more total fats <i>(p </i>= 0.003). Ultra-processed foods accounted for 39.80% and 40.10% of the HIV-positive and HIV-negative groups' caloric intake respectively (<i>p </i>= 0.893). The intake of these foods was associated with a higher consumption of carbohydrates (<i>p </i>< 0.001), trans fat (<i>p </i>= 0.013) and sodium (<i>p </i>< 0.001), as well as lower protein (<i>p </i>< 0.001) and fiber intake (<i>p </i>= 0.022).  These findings demonstrate that the energy consumption and ultra-processed food intake were similar in both groups, which reinforces the trend toward a high intake of ultra-processed food in the general population. The intake of ultra-processed food was positively associated with the consumption of carbohydrates, trans fat and sodium, and negatively associated with the consumption of protein and fiber.
