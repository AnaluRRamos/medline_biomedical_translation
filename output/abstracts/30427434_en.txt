Breastfeeding is a practice directly related to the health of the mother and especially the baby. Despite being a natural process, many mothers report difficulties with breastfeeding. This study aimed to seek scientific evidence on the issue: 'Can a mother with more confidence in breastfeeding exclusively breastfeed her baby for 06 months?'. We conducted a systematic review with a search in five electronic databases, and included four cohort studies for evaluation. We conducted a qualitative analysis of the results, considering the methodological differences and lack of data, and were unable to perform meta-analysis. Confidence in breastfeeding was evaluated by using the Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale. The studies analyzed showed statistically significant association between the practice of breastfeed and confidence in breastfeeding. The application of a scale to evaluate trust and identify mothers at risk for early weaning appeared to be a reliable measurement tool, capable of facilitating action planning by health professionals. The evidence showed association between mothers with higher levels of confidence in breastfeeding and exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months, but these results could not be generalized because of the heterogeneity of the population.
