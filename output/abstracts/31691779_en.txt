The study aimed to analyze barriers in access to health services in five Health Regions of Brazil. The study analyzed the answers to semi-structured questionnaires applied to health policymakers, providers, and professionals from the Brazilian Unified National Health System, referenced on the following dimensions: Geographic Accessibility, Availability, and Acceptability. The analysis pointed to specificities in barriers to access in the five regions, while others such as location and time spent to reach the service were barriers in nearly all of them, based on care for stroke patients. In terms of Availability, there were issues related to shortage of physicians, long waiting time, and integration among services in all the regions. As for Acceptability, the study highlighted users' belief that they have no health problems. The Health Regions located in South and Southeast Brazil showed the fewest and least variety of barriers, revealing the persistence of regional inequalities. Although the results do not represent the country as a whole, they allow identifying relevant issues for regionalization of the national health system.
