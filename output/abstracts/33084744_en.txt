To evaluate the prevalence and factors associated with binge drinking (BD) among young Brazilians. This cross-sectional study used data from the 2013 National Health Survey. The sample consisted of 7,823 young people aged between 18 and 24 years. The outcome was BD: four or more doses on one occasion for women and five doses or more for men. Sociodemographic, health and behavioral explanatory variables were considered. Binary Logistic Regression was used, with estimation of odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). The prevalence of BD among young Brazilians was 17%, with regional differences. The associated factors with a higher chance of BD were: 21 and 24 years old (OR = 1.35; 95%CI 1.08 - 1.70); employed (OR = 1.27; 95%CI 1.01 - 1.61); report tiredness (OR = 1.53; 95%CI 1.19 - 1.97) and currently smoking (OR = 4.10; 95%CI 2.95 - 5.70). Women (OR = 0.43; 95%CI 0.34 - 0.54) and participating in religious activities (OR = 0.67; 95%CI 0.53 - 0.84) were associated with a lower chance of BD. A national study evaluating the profile of young Brazilians who present episodes of binge drinking is important to favor the implementation of public prevention policies aimed at this specific population.
