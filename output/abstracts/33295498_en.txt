Primary Health Care (PHC) is an area of study that has improved remarkably in the last decades. In Brazil, this academic production is highly expressed in the field of Collective Health. This paper aims to analyze the PHC production published in the first 25 years of the 'Journal Ciência & Saúde Coletiva' (C&SC). A narrative review was carried out, with analysis of the themes, methods, scale of analysis, partnerships, and authorship. A total of 295 papers were published, which corresponds to 5.9% of the total publications. A growing trend in papers addressing PHC was observed. The studies were mostly empirical (78.6%), with a qualitative approach (58.0%) and were predominantly local or municipal. Studies on health professionals were more frequent. The three prevailing themes were the health care model, PHC performance or effectiveness, and the work process. The profile found dialogues with the rich and diverse experience of Brazilian PHC. However, the incorporation of broader analyses is still challenging. The published papers highlighted the debates and contributed to the reflection and dissemination of the experience of Brazilian PHC, which was and is central to the construction of the Brazilian Health System.
