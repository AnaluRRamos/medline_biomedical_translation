Loosening is a well-known complication of total hip arthroplasty. The accumulation of detritus resulting from mechanical wear forms inflammatory cells that have the function of phagocytizing this debris. Over the long term, these cells may give rise to a local granulomatous reaction. Here, we present a report on a case of pelvic pseudotumor subsequent to total hip arthroplasty, which is considered rare in the literature. The patient was a 48-year-old black man who started to be followed up medically eight months earlier because of uncharacteristic abdominal pains, dysuria and pollakiuria. He had undergone left total hip arthroplasty 17 years previously. Through clinical investigation and complementary examinations, an extra-articular granulomatous mass was diagnosed, constituting a pelvic pseudotumor.
