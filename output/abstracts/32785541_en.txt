The scope of this paper was to investigate the relationship between Arterial Hypertension (AH) and the occupational profile of teachers of basic public education and present a theoretical model. A probabilistic sample was adopted by clusters, with AH as the dependent variable. The independent variables were grouped in thematic blocks (Sociodemographic Characteristics, Occupational Profile, Behaviors and Health Outcomes) that composed the theoretical model. The analyses were corrected by the sample design. Hierarchical logistic regression was conducted. The prevalence of AH was 25%, and 58% reported dissatisfaction with the work. There was a higher probability of AH among older teachers (OR = 3.7), without postgraduate qualification (OR = 1.4), who also worked in the private network (OR = 2.6), who had a higher salt intake (OR = 1.7), with a high waist-hip ratio (OR = 1.9) and hypercholesterolemia / hypertriglyceridemia (OR = 1, 5) and a lower chance among females (OR = 0.5), who had other work activity (OR = 0.6) and were dissatisfied with the work (OR = 0.6). Thus, the occupational profile of teachers had an influence on AH. The relationship between work and teacher health demands attention and care, with measures that preserve and promote the health and well-being of teachers.
