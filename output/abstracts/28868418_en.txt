Protein-calorie malnutrition is a transversal condition to all stages of chronic liver disease. Early recognition of micro or macronutrient deficiencies is essential, because the use of nutritional supplements reduces the risk of complications. The diet of patients with chronic liver disease is based on a standard diet with supplements addition as necessary. Restrictions may be harmful and should be individualized. Treatment management should aim to maintain an adequate protein and caloric intake and to correct nutrient deficiencies. The large majority of patients with grade I/II hepatic encephalopathy can tolerate a regular diet. Protein restriction can aggravate malnutrition and is not recommended, except in cases of hepatic encephalopathy unresponsive to optimized therapy.
