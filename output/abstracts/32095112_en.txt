To investigate the existence of a causal association between orthopedic treatment and the occurrence of in hospital death. 338 patients with proximal femoral fracture were evaluated, of whom 27 faced in hospital death. Patients who faced in hospital death (case group) were compared to patients who did not (control group) regarding exposure to risk factors prior to injury and factors related to orthopedic treatment. The factors related to higher in hospital mortality rate were: male sex (case group: 52%, control: 26%; p = 0.005), lower Parker's score (case group: 5.0 points, control: 6.2; p = 0.048), delirium on admission (case group: 26%, control: 10%; p = 0.011); delirium developed during hospitalization (case group: 77%, control: 35%; p <0.001), and time until surgery (13.3 days, 9.1; p = 0.049). The in hospital mortality rate of patients with proximal femoral fracture was 8%, and the main associated risk factors were male sex, reduced Parker's score, delirium diagnosed on hospital admission or developed during hospitalization, and time until surgery. <b><i>Level of Evidence III, Case control study.</i></b>
