To evaluate the mechanical behavior of the proximal end of the femur submitted to the X-shaped polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) reinforcement technique. Fifteen synthetic femurs, with a Nacional<sup>Â®</sup> density of 10 PCF, were divided into two groups: the DX group, with 5 units that were submitted to PMMA reinforcement, and the DP group, with 10 units, which were evaluated intact. The volume of PMMA required, the maximum load, and the absorbed energy to fracture were analyzed by means of a static mechanical bending test simulating a fall on the greater trochanter. A mean of 6 ml of PMMA was used to model the X-reinforcement; it was observed that the DX group presented significantly higher maximum load (median = 1553 N, p = 0.005) and absorbed energy to fracture (median = 9.7 J; p = 0.050) than the DP group (median = 905 N and 6.6 J). X-reinforcement of the proximal end of synthetic femurs showed a statistically significant increase in the maximum load and absorbed energy to fracture in the mechanical assay when compared to the control group. <b><i>Level of Evidence III, Experimental study.</i></b>
