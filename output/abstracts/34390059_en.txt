Conjunctivitis in atopic dogs has already been described yet is rarely observed, and likely underdiagnosed in practice. To assay various cytokines in tears and conjunctivae from atopic and normal dogs, and to compare canine atopic dermatitis-associated conjunctivitis with controls. Ten atopic and ten normal client-owned dogs. Ocular surfaces were sampled bilaterally in a prospective study, using two different methods. Tear samples were obtained with a sterile swab previously moistened with saline solution (method A). Conjunctival impressions were obtained with a conjunctival impression device (method B). For each sample, the concentrations of a panel of 13 cytokines were measured by multiplex analyses. CADESI-4, pruritus (PS) and conjunctival (CS) scores were determined. Among the measured cytokines, only granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC)-like and interleukin (IL)-8 were above the limit of quantification in most samples. Absolute amounts of each cytokine were always higher in samples obtained with method A than with method B. GM-CSF amounts were lower in atopic dogs (method A, P=0.02; method B, P=0.0005). KC levels were higher in atopic dogs, yet the differences were not significant. IL-8 amounts were higher in atopic dogs (method A, P=0.0003; method B, P=0.006). Regardless of the method, these preliminary results suggest an overexpression of IL-8 in conjunctivae and tears of atopic dogs despite subtle conjunctival symptoms. As IL-8 is commonly found in many inflammatory conditions, further studies are needed to determine its specificity in atopic conjunctivitis.
