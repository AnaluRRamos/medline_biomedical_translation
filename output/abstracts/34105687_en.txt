This theoretical study aims to discuss the role of nurses in the mechanical prevention of venous thromboembolism in surgical patients. The study considered the updated versions of the main international guidelines and reviews on the topic. Non-pharmacological measures to prevent venous thromboembolism in surgical patients and the role of nurses are discussed. It is important that surgical nurses include in their activities risk of assessments for venous thromboembolism and non-pharmacological prophylactic measures, based on scientific evidence and well-designed institutional protocols. Among the mechanical measures, the use of graduated compression stockings and intermittent pneumatic compression should be ensured by nurses.
