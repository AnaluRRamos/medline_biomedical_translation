We describe the development of nursing in Portugal since the creation of the National Health Service (SNS) in 1979, focusing on staff numbers, education, work conditions, career, and professional organization. We used the literature on the evolution of the Portuguese health sector and statistical data from the Nursing Council and the SNS. The number of nurses grew by 233% in the last 40 years, but the nurse/physician ratio only increased from 1.15 to 1.4. Most work in hospitals, despite repeated political commitments to expand primary health care. In the SNS, 55% are public servants, and the others are employed through private law contracts. The basic nursing course is currently offered in 20 public and 16 private institutions. In 2019, the career structure was revised and now comprises three categories: nurse, specialist nurse, nurse manager. Nurses remain moderately satisfied despite complaints about working conditions, remuneration, and lack of career progress. Nurses' role barely changed over the years, and the Medical Association is resisting to its expansion.
