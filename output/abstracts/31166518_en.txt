The scope of this paper was to investigate the associations of disability in three domains (BADL, IADL and mobility) with cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and multimorbidity profile, among the elderly living in the Metropolitan Region of Belo Horizonte (MRBH). A cross-sectional study was conducted with a representative sample of 2,172 elderly persons (60 years and over). Disability, for each domain (BADL, IADL and mobility), was assessed as reporting great difficulty or need for help to perform at least one activity among those investigated, and self-reported diseases included arterial hypertension, myocardial infarction or angina, stroke, diabetes, and combinations of these diseases. Adjusted Poisson regression was used, and the attributable population fraction was also estimated. A major contribution of Cerebral Vascular Accidents (strokes) to disability in all domains was observed, especially BADLs, as well as the presence of infarction or angina in disability in IADLs and mobility, especially when combined with diabetes and hypertension. The multimorbidity profile can be used to identify vulnerable groups, which should be the target of prevention and rehabilitation, reducing the financial and social cost of this event among the elderly.
