The objective of this study was to analyze factors associated with the body adiposity index. A population-based, cross-sectional study was conducted with 964 adults between 20 and 59 years of age, in Vi√ßosa, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Household questionnaires and anthropometric measurements were applied to obtain data. Multiple analysis was performed using linear regression, adjusted for the sampling design effect. The prevalence of excess body adiposity was 36.89 (CI 30.81 to 43.43), being higher among men (48.18% - CI 39.09 to 57.34). Factors positively associated with body adiposity index were: female sex (p = 0.002); age in years (p < 0.001); those living with a partner (p = 0.022). Self-evaluation of positive health (p = 0.048) was negatively associated with the body adiposity index. The prevalence of excess body fat was high and the sex, age, marital status, health self-evaluation and dissatisfaction with body image were determinant factors to the increase in body adiposity in this population, indicating a marked risk for chronic diseases resulting from excess body fat.
