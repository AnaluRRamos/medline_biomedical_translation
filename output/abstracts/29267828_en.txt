The scope of this study was to investigate dental care from the life course perspective and its determinant factors among young people in the city of Sobral, State of Cear√°, Brazil. A cohort study was conducted with waves in 2000, 2006 and 2012 with 482 young people aged between 17 and 21 years. Two outcomes were investigated: immediate dental care and the lack of dental care, based on the dental trajectory in relation to restorative treatment. Socioeconomic conditions and recourse to oral health services and actions in the three waves investigated were used as independent variables. It was found that low socioeconomic status throughout life presented itself as a risk factor for lack of dental care and the inverse effect was observed with immediate dental care. Participation in groups of teenagers was also related to dental care, as well as receiving information on oral health. This study revealed the presence of inequalities in dental care throughout the life course of the population assessed.
