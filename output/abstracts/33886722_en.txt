Heart transplant is the main therapeutic alternative for advanced heart failure patients. Several risk factors affect these patients' survival; however, few studies about the topic are available in Brazil. To review the survival rates of heart transplant patients in the Brazilian Public Health System (Sistema Único de Saúde - SUS) between 2000 and 2015. This is a non-concurrent, open cohort study, involving cardiac transplant patients in Brazil. The cumulative survival probability was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier curve, and the curve comparison was done using the Log-Rank test. The Cox model was used to calculate the Hazard-Ratio (HR). Analyses were conducted at the 95% confidence level. The heart transplant survival rate median in Brazil, during the period, was 8.3 years. Each additional year in the recipient's age, the occurrence of infections, and the performance of the surgical procedure in the South Region were associated with a higher risk of graft loss. A higher use ratio of immunosuppressants mycophenolate and azathioprine acted as a protection factor. The analyses conducted provide the first information about the median survival time in heart transplant patients in Brazil. The difference noticed among the geographical regions may be related to the different treatment protocols adopted in the country, especially in the early 2000s. The rate of mycophenolate and azathioprine use as a protection factor suggests that, despite the absence of differences among therapeutic strategies, use of these drugs may favor survival of certain patients. The study provides robust epidemiological data, which are relevant for public health.
