To identify muscle tension dysphonia (MTD) signs and symptoms, as well as to analyze the results of vocal parameters, the physical clinical examination of muscle palpation, the self-perception of vocal symptoms, vocal pain, and fatigue of women with MTD and compare them with women with healthy voices. a cross-sectional study with 45 women (23 with MTD and 22 controls), similar median age between groups. The speech-language and otorhinolaryngological evaluation determined the diagnosis of MTD. All participants responded to the Voice Symptoms Scale (VoiSS), Vocal Fatigue Index (VFI), and Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (NMQ) protocols. They were also assessed by a palpatory evaluation of the perilaryngeal musculature, auditory-perceptual evaluation, and acoustic analysis of the voice fundamental frequency. The speech sample included sustained vowels 'a', 'i' and 'e' and connected speech, recorded in a silent environment, and submitted to auditory-perceptual evaluation by three judges. In the acoustic analysis, the fundamental frequency and maximum phonation times were extracted. The MTD group had worse results in VoiSS, VFI, and NMQ, in addition to greater resistance to palpation and a high vertical position of the larynx. The vocal parameters also showed greater deviation in the MTD group, except for the fundamental frequency. There was no relationship between vocal symptoms, fatigue, or pain with the general degree of dysphonia in the MTD group, indicating important symptoms in mild or moderate vocal deviations. women with MTD presented vocal symptoms, vocal fatigue, muscle pain, resistance to palpation and deviated vocal parameters when compared to vocally healthy women.
