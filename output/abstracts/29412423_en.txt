This study aimed to evaluate the perception of health related quality of life (HRQoL) of adolescent students. This is a cross-sectional study with 807 adolescents aged 10 to 17 years from two public schools of Niteroi and four private schools of Rio de Janeiro and São Gonçalo. Information on HRQoL was obtained by a reduced version of the Kidscreen questionnaire with 27 items. Student t tests were used to assess the perception of HRQoL stratified by type of school, gender, age and ownership of assets. We used linear regression models to evaluate HRQoL settings. In general, the evaluated adolescents evidenced a good HRQoL. However, results show significant differences in the perception of each HRQoL realm between subgroups. Private school adolescents had better HRQoL compared to public schools in all Kidscreen-27 realms. Older adolescents, those from public school and those with lower ownership of assets had lower HRQoL values in most realms, particularly in the 'Autonomy and Relationship with Parents' realm. Disclosure of the differentiated profile of HRQoL among adolescents is the first step towards developing action strategies in the school environment that prioritize the most vulnerable groups.
