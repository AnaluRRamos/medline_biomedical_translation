The increase in agricultural productivity, especially sugarcane production, is generally associated with the use of agrochemicals. The risk of contamination of these compounds in water resources is a concern for public and environmental health. In this context, the scope of this study was to estimate the contamination potential of the groundwater and surface water by agrochemicals applied in a sugar and alcohol area in the metropolitan region of João Pessoa, Santa Rita/Paraíba. Analysis was performed according to the criteria proposed by the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency), namely the GUS index (Groundwater Ubiquity Score) and the GOSS method (surface water). As a result of the estimate of groundwater contamination, it was observed that 52% out of 25 active compounds evaluated by the methods (EPA and GUS), showed a tendency of potential contamination. With respect to the contamination of surface waters, most of the active principles had a greater tendency to transport their molecules dissolved in water and transported them through rainwater. Thus, the conclusion drawn is that there is a need for the implementation of environmental monitoring programs and measures aimed at the protection of public health.
