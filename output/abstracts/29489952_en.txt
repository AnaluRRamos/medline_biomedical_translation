This cross-sectional study examined the integration of primary care in the healthcare network of the Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS), using the Gradual Response Model of Item Response Theory. Based on data from 17,202 teams that participated in the National Program for Access and Quality Improvement in Primary Care (PMAQ-AB, 2012), we measured gradients of integration to identify the teams' profile by level of integration. The results show that the items pertaining to matrix support measures (medical consultations, case discussions, shared clinical action, joint elaboration of therapeutic projects, permanent educational activities, work process discussions, interventions in the territory, and visits with primary care professionals) improved the performance of primary care teams. Communications devices between teams reinforced this understanding. Still, the approximately 50% of answers associated with the worst scenario for some study items evidenced the need to upgrade the integration between primary care activities and specialized care for the consolidation of comprehensive primary healthcare.
