The rupture of a mining dam in southeastern Brazil in 2015 was the country's greatest environmental tragedy. In order to evaluate the ecological risks of the mine tailings on the Rio Doce estuary, this study assessed trace metal contamination and sediment quality indices up to 2.9 y after the dam rupture. Surface sediments were collected from 17 stations on the Rio Doce estuary and Cd, Pb, Cr, Zn, Cu, and As concentrations were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). Four ecological risk indices (modified contamination degree [mCd], pollution load index [PLI], risk index [RI], and sediment quality guideline quotient [SQG-Q]) suggest a high risk by metal contamination with possible adverse biological effects, with moderate seasonal variability. Based on a precautionary approach, our results support fisheries closures and the need for public health monitoring in the affected areas, and support other studies that suggest chronic metal contamination of the Rio Doce estuary.
