To compare two different fat-saturated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques-STIR and T2 SPAIR-in terms of image quality, as well as in terms of their diagnostic performance in detecting sacroiliac joints (SIJ) active inflammation. We included 69 consecutive patients with suspected spondyloarthritis undergoing MRI between 2012 and 2014. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was calculated with the method recommended by the American College of Radiology. Two readers evaluated SIJ MRI following ASAS criteria to assess diagnostic performance regarding the detection of active SIJ inflammation. T1 SPIR Gd+ sequence was used as the reference standard. The mean SNR was 72.8 for the T1 SPIR Gd+ sequence, compared with 14.1 and 37.6 for the STIR and T2 SPAIR sequences, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of STIR and SPAIR T2 sequences did not show any statistically significant differences, for the diagnosis of sacroiliitis with active inflammation. Our results corroborate those in the recent literature suggesting that STIR sequences are not superior to T2 SPAIR sequences for SIJ evaluation in patients with suspected spondyloarthritis. On 1.5-T MRI, T2-weighted SPAIR sequences provide better SNRs than do STIR sequences, which reinforces that T2 SPAIR sequences may be an advantageous option for the evaluation of sacroiliitis.
