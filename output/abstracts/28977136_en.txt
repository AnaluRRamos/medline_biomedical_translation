To report the clinical evolution and handling of a Spitz nevus, from its initial flat feature to becoming an irregular, nodular, reddish lesion. Female child, phototype II, with a small congenital nevus on the left lower limb and other sustained small nevi. The patient went through annual clinical and dermoscopic evaluations between the ages of three and seven, period during which the nevi located on the left thigh grew rapidly. The clinical hypothesis was Spitz nevus, with indication of surgical removal with a safety margin and anatomopathological study. Considering patient's age and clinical/histological aspects, the diagnosis of Spitz nevus was confirmed. Initial globular pattern and size under 5 mm upon dermoscopy allowed clinical follow-up. However, onset of hyperchromia and rapid growing of the lesion, along with aesthetic concerns, possibility of trauma in the region, and risk of malignancy at puberty guided the decision of total resection and follow-up for recurrence.
