With the increasing use of machine perfusion in kidney transplantation, it has been observed that dynamic ischemia correlates with the improvement of organ preservation. In this context, we performed a systematic review that aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the portable machine perfusion (LifePort Kidney Transporter MachineÂ®), used in Brazil, compared to cold storage, regarding the delayed graft function of deceased donors with brain death. Literature search was carried out in LILACS, MEDLINE via PubMed, Scopus, Clarivate Analytics, Cochrane Library, Embase, and SciELO, as well as in Google Scholar manually. The systematic review consisted only of randomized clinical trials. For meta-analysis, relative risk and odds ratio were evaluated. Eighty-six documents were identified and two papers from European and Brazilian groups were selected at the end, with eligibility criteria for meta-analysis. In these, 374 kidneys were assigned to machine perfusion and 374 kidneys were assigned to cold storage. Delayed graft function was observed in 84 and 110 patients, respectively. In meta-analysis, a risk ratio of 0.7568 (p=0.0151) and an odds ratio of 0.6665 (p=0.0225) were obtained, both with a 95% confidence interval. Machine perfusion reduced the incidence of delayed graft function of deceased donors with brain death.
