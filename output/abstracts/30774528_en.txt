To compare the clinical outcomes and quality of life of patients surgically treated for lumbar spinal stenosis with decompression and posterolateral fusion, and decompression with interbody fusion. The study included 88 patients with lumbar canal stenosis who underwent surgery treatment (decompression and interbody fusion in 36 patients and decompression and posterolateral fusion [PL] in 52 patients). The clinical outcomes were assessed using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Roland-Morris (RM) functional disability scale, and visual analog scale (VAS) for pain. These questionnaires were administered preoperatively and 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years postoperatively. Eighty-eight patients had surgery 2 years prior. The ODI and RM scale scores showed significant differences in the posterolateral group. In the interbody group, the ODI score showed a significant change only from before to 1 and 2 years after surgery. The VAS score significantly changed only from before to after surgery in the posterolateral group, but in the interbody group, the change was also observed at 1 month and 1 year after surgery. The two techniques are effective surgical treatment options for lumbar canal stenosis as long as they are well indicated. <i><b>Level of evidence III, Comparative prospective case-control study.</b></i>
