Postoperative vitreous hemorrhage is a complication following vitrectomy for proliferative diabetic retinopathy, delaying visual recovery and making fundus examination and disease follow-up more difficult. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor drugs such as bevacizumab, when injected in the vitreous cavity, reduce vascular proliferation and their use has been proposed to reduce the incidence of postoperative vitreous hemorrhage. The authors of this Cochrane systematic review evaluated all randomized controlled trials on the pre- or intraoperative use of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor to reduce postoperative vitreous hemorrhage occurrence after vitrectomy in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy. The results suggested that the use of intravitreal bevacizumab was effective in reducing early postoperative vitreous hemorrhage (i.e. at four weeks) occurrence, with a good safety profile. This work aims to summarize and discuss the findings and clinical implications of this Cochrane systematic review.
