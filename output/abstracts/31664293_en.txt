The aim of this study was to evaluate the degree of penetration of obturation cement in artificial lateral canals after Passive Ultrasonic Irrigation (PUI) with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) for different times. Fifty upper molar palatine roots were used, in which two artificial lateral canals were made at distances of 7 and 3 millimeters from the root apex. After instrumentation and drying the canal, the final toilet stage was performed on five groups (n = 10), as follows: G1 - EDTA 17% + PUI for 10 seconds; G2 - EDTA 17% + PUI for 20 seconds; G3 - EDTA 17% + PUI for 30 seconds; G4 - EDTA 17% + PUI for 60 seconds; G5 - EDTA 17% + activation by instrument R50 for 5 minutes (Control). The canals were sealed by the single cone technique, and after 72 hours, sectioned in two planes transverse to the artificial canal, to see the degree of penetration of the sealing cement. In the radiographic analysis, there was no statistical difference (p> 0.05) between groups in the two artificial lateral canals. However, PUI of EDTA for 60 seconds produced a significant difference in the degree of penetration of the sealing cement (p <0.05) at 7 mm from the apex. Therefore, PUI with EDTA for 60 seconds promoted a higher degree of penetration of the obturator cement in the artificial lateral canal.
