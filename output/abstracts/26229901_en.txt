Lesions of the axillary artery are rare in patients with fracturing of the proximal third of the humerus and may have greatly varying clinical manifestations. They are responsible for 15% and 20% of upper-limb artery injuries and the commonest mechanism is a fall to the ground, which accounts for 79% of such injuries. In some cases, the signs only appear later on. It is important to bear this association in mind, so as to make an early diagnosis and avoid serious complications. We report on a case of traumatic injury of the axillary artery secondary to fracturing of the proximal third of the humerus in an 84-year-old patient, with late evolution of clinical signs of ischemia in the limb affected. The aim here was to discuss the diagnostic difficulties and treatment.
