To analyze the perception of stress and social support of nursing students considering the number of supporters and the satisfaction with them. Quantitative, cross-sectional study performed with nursing students from a public university in the state of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. We used the Stress Evaluation in Nursing Students scale and the Social Support Questionnaire. We performed the chi-squared test and analyzed the structure of the support network using software Gephi version 0.9.1. 192 students participated. Family and friends were the most mentioned supporters. Despite counting on a low number of supporters, most participants were satisfied with the perceived support. The students presented high intensity of stress in the 'professional training' domain. Furthermore, the students who were pleased with the perceived social support presented low intensity of stress in accomplishing the theoretical activities of the undergraduate course. The creation of more welcoming spaces in the academic environment, the qualification of the social support, and the employment of strategies to improve the transition from the student stage to the professional stage are important recommendations that will contribute for positive outcomes regarding the coping with student stress.
