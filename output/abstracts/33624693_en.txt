The study aimed to estimate the total contraceptive discontinuity rates in the use of oral and injectable hormonal contraceptives, and male condoms and dropout rates due to switches to more effective and less effective methods. Data on 2,051 women, users of primary healthcare services in three Brazilian state capitals, were collected using the contraceptive calendar. The results showed that 24.5% of users of oral hormonal contraceptives, 33.5% of users of injectables, and 39% of users of male condoms had discontinued the respective method after 12 months of use, independently of the reason, and that the rates varied little between the capitals but did depend on the method. The main reason for discontinuing use of the contraceptive method was the desire to become pregnant (20.8%). Conception while using the method was reported by 20% of the women, a proportion that reached 25.7% in users of male condoms. After 12 months with the method, the dropout rate for reasons related to the contraceptive method was 11.4% in users of injectables; 15.9% of users of male condoms switched to a more effective method; and 16.3% of users of injectables switched to a less effective method. Contraceptive discontinuity rates were high and varied according to the contraceptive method.
