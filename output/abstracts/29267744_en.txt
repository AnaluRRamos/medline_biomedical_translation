The quality control of data entry in computerized questionnaires is an important step in the validation of new instruments. The study assessed the consistency of recorded weight and height on the Food Intake and Physical Activity of School Children (Web-CAAFE) between repeated measures and against directly measured data. Students from the 2nd to the 5th grade (n = 390) had their weight and height directly measured and then filled out the Web-CAAFE. A subsample (n = 92) filled out the Web-CAAFE twice, three hours apart. The analysis included hierarchical linear regression, mixed linear regression model, to evaluate the bias, and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), to assess consistency. Univariate linear regression assessed the effect of gender, reading/writing performance, and computer/internet use and possession on residuals of fixed and random effects. The Web-CAAFE showed high values of ICC between repeated measures (body weight = 0.996, height = 0.937, body mass index - BMI = 0.972), and regarding the checked measures (body weight = 0.962, height = 0.882, BMI = 0.828). The difference between means of body weight, height, and BMI directly measured and recorded was 208 g, -2 mm, and 0.238 kg/mÂ², respectively, indicating slight BMI underestimation due to underestimation of weight and overestimation of height. This trend was related to body weight and age. Height and weight data entered in the Web-CAAFE by children were highly correlated with direct measurements and with the repeated entry. The bias found was similar to validation studies of self-reported weight and height in comparison to direct measurements.
