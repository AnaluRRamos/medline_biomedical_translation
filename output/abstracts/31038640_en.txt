to identify the prevalence of smokers between the psychiatric population and the general population; to compare the personal, socio-demographic and clinical profile of smokers and non-smokers in the psychiatric population and the general population; to compare the reasons for smoking of these two population groups. this is a cross-sectional descriptive-analytical epidemiological study with 378 patients from three services: Ambulatory Mental Health, Psychiatric Hospital, and Basic Health Unit. Interviews were conducted with three questionnaires. The Chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis tests were applied. in the total of the 378 participants, 67% were women and 69% were over 40 years old. There was a higher prevalence of smokers among men, young people, illiterates, singles and with more than one government benefit. Smokers prevailed among schizophrenics, chronic patients, who used ≥ 3 psychotropic drugs and had a history of ≥ 4 psychiatric hospitalizations and/or suicide attempts. The main reason for smoking was the improvement of negative feelings. the prevalence of smokers is higher in the psychiatric population (especially among severely ill patients) and among men, young people, unmarried and with socioeconomic losses. The main reason for smoking is tension/relaxation relief. This study provides nurses and other professionals with knowledge capable of subsidizing the planning of smoking interventions in the Brazilian population.
