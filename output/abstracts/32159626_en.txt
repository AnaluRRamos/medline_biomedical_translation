To study associated factors with loss productivity in people involved road traffic accidents (RTA). The population based cohort study was conducted in Jequi√©, Brazil between 2013 to 2015. The instrument for interview was used in people involved in RTA and interview in four months. Individuals, occupational, health conditions, injury and support variables were used for bivariate and multivariate analysis. The cumulative incidence was loss productivity was 61.1% and density incidence of 7.45 cases/100 person-month. Multivariate analysis showed association for injury (IDR = 4.23; 95%CI = 2.90 - 6.17) and vehicle used with work instrument (IDR = 2.80; 95%CI = 1.62 - 4.85). Public policies are needed to ensure traffic safety in order to minimize the effects of RTA about productivity and to carry news studies to expand knowledge about loss productivity.
