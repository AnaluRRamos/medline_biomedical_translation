Few studies have described the pathophysiology, clinical course, treatment outcomes and quality of life (QoL) of cats with pemphigus foliaceus (PF). Describe clinicopathological features, treatment outcomes and impacts on QoL in feline PF. Forty-nine client-owned cats with PF that presented to a veterinary teaching hospital between 1987 and 2017. Medical records and histopathological reports were reviewed to obtain clinicopathological data and treatment outcomes. Owners were contacted and requested to complete a questionnaire to obtain long-term follow-up and evaluate the impacts of PF on QoL of cats and owners. Domestic short/medium/long hair breeds were most commonly affected, with pinnae, head, haired face, nasal planum and ungual folds most frequently involved. Associated pruritus and systemic signs of illness were common. Vasculopathological changes were noted in a small proportion of cats. Corticosteroid monotherapy was sufficient to induce complete remission in the majority of cats. Pemphigus foliaceus and its management had a negative impact on QoL of both cats and owners. Receiving/administering medications, attending veterinary appointments, and financial and time commitments were cited sources of stress for affected cats and/or owners. Results illustrate that affected cats generally respond favourably to treatment but do require long-term therapy. The exact aetiology of the vasculopathological changes was unclear; it may reflect the stage or severity of disease or suggest the presence of a cutaneous adverse drug reaction. Clinicians managing cats with PF should be aware of the potential negative impact on QoL of owners and cats and adjust management accordingly.
