Asthma is the result of a complex interaction between genetic, environmental and socioeconomic factors. It represents a serious global public health problem. The goal of this study was to identify geographic areas for priority actions in order to control of asthma in children. Ecological study that space-time statistic Scan was used. Non-elective, short-stay (type 1) paid authorizations of hospitalizations were selected according to hospitalizations year and children place of residence. In the two periods of the study, the high risk primary cluster was located in the region of Barra do Bugres (relative risk = 8.17, in the first period, and 10.37, in the second). The number of high-risk clusters increased from 8, in the period 2001-2004, to 9, in 2005-2012; while low-risk clusters decreased from 6, in the initial period, to 4, in the latest. The priority geographic areas for attention and intervention for children with asthma are the region around Barra do Bugres, which remained in the two periods with high risk primary clusters and the southwest border of the State that presented increase of the risk. Furthermore, there was an increase of 87% in the number of high risk counties and a reduction of 28% of the counties of protection. In conclusion, the surroundings areas of Barra do Bugres and Porto Estrela and the east and northeast border of the state are priority for health care, once there was an increased risk of hospitalization of children due to asthma.
