Visual demands, especially for near vision, are becoming increasingly more frequent at the workplace, and might cause visual fatigue or asthenopia. The tasks performed by ophthalmologists involve visual effort, raising interest in their study within the context of occupational health. To estimate the prevalence of visual complaints and its relationship to work demands among ophthalmologists at a university hospital in Lisbon. Occurrence of visual fatigue symptoms was assessed by means of a symptom questionnaire - College of Optometrists in Vision Development Quality of Life (COVD-QoL) - and through the identification of near points of accommodation and convergence. Schirmer's test was used to assess tear production. The results were analyzed by means of descriptive statistics, Spearman's coefficient and the Wilcoxon test for p<0.05. Most among the 27 analyzed physicians reported visual fatigue (n=25), dry eyes and frequent blinking (n=27). Schirmer's test evidenced differences at the end of the working day and the near points of accommodation and convergence indicated occurrence of visual fatigue. The results showed significant differences between the beginning and the end of the working day among ophthalmologists, with occurrence of visual fatigue at the end of the working day. These findings point to the need to implement a health surveillance program to prevent occupational visual disorders.
