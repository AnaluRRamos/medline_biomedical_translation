Atheroembolism is a rare multisystemic disorder that is characterized by release of cholesterol crystals and particles from atheromatous plaques, which can occlude distal vessels and induce an inflammatory response. Most affected individuals are males, older than 60 years of age, with advanced atherosclerotic disease. The abdominal aorta is the most common origin of cholesterol emboli, being the peripheral arteries a rarer source. Cholesterol embolization syndrome is often associated with invasive vascular procedures, although, more rarely, it may occur spontaneously. In this paper, the authors present three cases of spontaneous atheroembolism with cutaneous manifestations and their clinical management. Being an underdiagnosed pathology, knowledge about its clinical manifestations is essential in order to allow an early diagnosis and treatment, to ensure a better prognosis for the patient.
