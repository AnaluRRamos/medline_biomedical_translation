The scope of this paper is to analyze the discursive strategies of a Ministry of Health publication, by virtue of the fact that another notion of food and nutrition care (FNC) emerges from them. Through discourse analysis, the results are interpreted mainly in the light of Edgar Morin and Anemarie Mol's studies. The analysis identified elements of the complex thinking constituting a broadened perspective about the food and FNC practices in the context of matrix support. As the main discursive strategy, narratives contextualize care in sinuous and inconclusive scenarios, emphasizing the immanence of unpredictability and uncertainty. Metaphorical resources reveal displacements that remove the centrality of Biomedicine and weave in the subject the practical wisdom of dealing with the coexistence between the generality of body and food metrification and the uniqueness of everyday life and eating. The stories contribute to the understanding of FNC as shared management, which aims to restore viable and ever provisional order. In conclusion, by exposing and legitimizing the plurality of ways of acting, the document that emerges from and relates back to it can have repercussions on health education and raise the theoretical repertoire surrounding FNC practices.
