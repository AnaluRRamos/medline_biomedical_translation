To investigate orbital vascular resistance by Doppler velocimetry in patients with steady-state sickle cell anemia, as well as to characterize its relationship with biomarkers of hemolysis. This was a cross-sectional study of two groups: 71 outpatients with sickle cell anemia; and 32 age- and gendermatched, healthy subjects (control group). All participants underwent Doppler velocimetry of the orbital arteries and laboratory tests. All biochemical laboratory markers were abnormal in the sickle cell anemia patients (<i>p</i> < 0.0001 vs. controls). In the patient group, Doppler velocimetry revealed increased flow velocities in the ophthalmic artery and reduced flow velocities in the central retinal artery, as well as high values for the resistance index (RI) and pulsatility index (PI) in both arteries (<i>p</i> < 0.0001 vs. controls). Biomarkers of hemolysis were found to correlate significantly with the RI and PI indices. In the ophthalmic artery, the reticulocyte count showed a moderate direct correlation with RI and with PI. In the central retinal artery, hemoglobin showed a strong inverse correlation with RI and with PI. Orbital vascular resistance, as evaluated by Doppler velocimetry, is elevated in patients with steady-state sickle cell anemia and shows a significant correlation with biomarkers of hemolysis.
