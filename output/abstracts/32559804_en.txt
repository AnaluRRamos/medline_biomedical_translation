To perform a comprehensive review to provide practical recommendations regarding the diagnosis and treatment of benign adnexal masses, as well as information for appropriate consent, regarding possible loss of the ovarian reserve.  A comprehensive review of the literature was performed to identify the most relevant data about this subject.  In total, 48 studies addressed the necessary aspects of the review, and we described their epidemiology, diagnoses, treatment options with detailed techniques, and perspectives regarding future fertility.  Adnexal masses are extremely common. The application of diagnosis algorithms is mandatory to exclude malignancy. A great number of cases can be managed with surveillance. Surgery, when necessary, should be performed with adequate techniques. However, even in the hands of experienced surgeons, there is a significant decrease in ovarian reserves, especially in cases of endometriomas. There is an evident necessity of studies that focus on the long-term impact on fertility.
