Bisphenol A (BPA) is a substance extensively used in daily life, mainly in plastic materials. This study assessed the exposure of university students to endocrine disruptor BPA, their knowledge about this substance and the damage it causes to human health. This is a cross-sectional descriptive study carried out with 500 students from a University in Curitiba. The sample was selected proportionally to the three major areas of knowledge, and the courses interviewed were drawn at random. Students were asked to fill out an objective questionnaire consisting of three parts: socioeconomic, assessment of exposure and knowledge tests. Of the respondents, 91.3% consume food stored in plastic packaging, 90.06% use drinks in this type of container and 84.8% consume canned food/drinks. However, only 19.8% have heard of BPA and 97.2% do not know about the relationship between exposure to BPA and endocrine changes. A high rate of exposure to BPA and a low level of knowledge on the subject was detected. This disproportion highlights the need for more in-depth research on the topic among the Brazilian population, in addition to broadening dissemination of information measures on the issue.
