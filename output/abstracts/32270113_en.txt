To identify the occupations of patients with oral cavity (OCC) or oropharyngeal (OPC) cancer in Curitiba, Parana, Brazil. Cross-sectional study in which we analyzed 896 cases of OCC and OPC based on the Population-based Cancer Registry, 1998-2012. The located occupations were categorized in four risk groups following the classification formulated by the Ministry of Labor. We also analyzed variables smoking and alcohol consumption. The highest rates of oral cancer corresponded to occupations associated with cleaning, construction, administration, agriculture and transport. Most occupations, 52.2%, were categorized as risk grade 3. This rate increased to 65.5% when smoking and alcohol consumption were included in analysis. Workers in trade, construction, cleaning services and mechanics accounted for the largest number of OCC and OPC cases in the analyzed municipality. We found 131 occupations associated with cases of oral cancer, most of which were categorized as risk grade 3. In consequence, occupational risk should be considered in the planning of preventive actions.
