The beneficial effects of Elabela on the cardiovascular system have been shown in studies. To compare serum Elabela levels of chronic total occlusion (CTO) patients with control patients with normal coronary arteries, and to investigate whether there is a correlation with collateral development. The study was planned cross-sectionally and prospectively. Fifty patients (28.0% female, mean age 61.6±7.3years) with CTO in at least one coronary vessel and 50 patients (38% female, mean age 60,7±6.38 years) with normal coronary arteries were included in the study. Patients in the CTO group were divided into two groups as Rentrop 0-1, those with weak collateral development, and Rentrop 2-3 with good collateral development. In addition to the age, sex, demographic characteristics and routine laboratory tests of the patients, Elabela levels were measured. Demographic characteristics and laboratory values were similar in both groups. While the mean NT-proBNP and troponin were higher in the CTO group, the Elabela mean was lower (p <0.05 for all). In the multivariate regression analysis, NT-proBNP and Elabela levels were found to be independent predictors for CTO. Also, Elabela level was found to be statistically higher in Rentrop class 2-3 patients compared to Rentrop class 0-1 patients (p<0.05). In our study, we showed that the average Elabela level was low in CTO patients compared to normal patients. In addition, we found the level of Elabela to be lower in patients with weak collateral development compared to patients with good collateral development.
