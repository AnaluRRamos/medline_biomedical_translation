The current coronavirus pandemic has already taken a great toll globally, causing massive morbidity and mortality. One of its severe forms is a thrombophilic state that can damage several systems. This article reports the case of 60-year-old female patient who presented with mild flu symptoms, which turned out to be a SARS-CoV2 infection, and ended up developing arterial thrombosis with limb ischemia in a private care hospital in Sorocaba, SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. Considering this progression, we decided to intervene with low molecular weight heparin and Alprostadil, achieving a good clinical outcome. Our description aims to identify key points and clinical signs that offer evidence of the therapeutic window and a treatment option for coagulatory presentations of COVID-19.
