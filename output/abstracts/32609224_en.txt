Identify factors related to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health for Children and Youth (ICF-CY) representing more than one category and verify their association with sociodemographic and health care aspects in a speech-language pathology (SLP) outpatient clinic. This is an observational, analytical, cross-sectional study based on a retrospective analysis of secondary data. One hundred eighty medical records of patients aged 5-16 years evaluated between 2010 and 2014 were included in the study. Sociodemographic and health care aspects were identified in these records, as well as presence of the ICF-CY Body Functions and Activities and Participation component categories. Analyses of the frequency distribution and measures of central tendency and dispersion of the variables, as well as Factor Analysis were carried out to create representative indicators of the ICF-CY categories identified. The Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests and the Spearman's correlation were used to analyze the associations, adopting a statistical significance level of 5%. Two factors that presented statistically relevant associations with the sociodemographic and health care variables were identified for the Body Functions component. As for the Activities and Participation component, three factors predominantly associated with the health care variables were identified. Items representative of the ICF-CY Body Functions and Activities and Participation categories and their respective factorial loads were identified. Statistically significant associations were verified between them and the sociodemographic and health care variables analyzed.
