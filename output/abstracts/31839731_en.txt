To report surgical techniques and results in the treatment of chronic Monteggia fracture-dislocation in children. Six pediatric patients who had undergone a procedure involving the following 6 crucial surgical steps were retrospectively evaluated: 1- extended lateral approach, 2- fibrotic removal, 3-proximal ulnar osteotomy, 4- reduction of the radial head and transcapitellar temporary fixation, 5- ulnar fixation with a straight plate shaped according to the deformity generated by temporary fixation, and 6- transcapitellar Kirschner wire removal. Four patients were women, and four showed the right-sided compromise. The mean age of patients was 8 years, and the minimum follow-up period was 12 months. The mean time from the onset of fracture to treatment was 6 months. Six patients underwent complete flexo/extension, and one patient had a complete prono-supination. In four patients, we observed loss of pronation (by 10째 in two, 15째 in one, and 20째 in one), and one patient had a 15째 decrease in supination. We did not observe any redislocation of the radial head in the follow-up evaluation. No complications were observed; the only complaint was salience of the ulnar plate. Our results demonstrated an effective option for the treatment of chronic Monteggia fracture-dislocation in children, even with a small study sample, following the presented technical and surgical strategies. <b><i>Level of evidence IV, Therapeutic Studies.</i></b>
