Subcutaneous emphysema is a possible but rare complication after dental procedures. The condition should be distinguished from other situations, such as hematoma, allergic reaction or angioedema, and infection. We describe the case of a 20-year-old puerperal woman, with multiple dental caries, who developed cervicofacial subcutaneous emphysema complicated by pneumomediastinum, following an incomplete extraction of the lower right second molar. This was diagnosed clinically and through imaging tests, and the situation resolved after hospital admission, with antibiotics and close monitoring. The case underlines the need to diagnose and treat this complication early, because of the risk of airway compromise, air embolism, infection, sepsis and death.
