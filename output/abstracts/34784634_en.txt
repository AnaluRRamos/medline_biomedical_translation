To analyze the scientific production regarding maternal folic acid (FA) supplementation and its relationship with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD).  We performed unrestricted electronic searches in the BIREME virtual bank, Virtual Health Library (VHL) and Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE/PubMed) databases.  For sample selection, articles that met the proposed objectives were included, published in English, Spanish and Portuguese, the use of Health Sciences Descriptors (DeCS): <i>autistic</i> OR <i>autism</i> AND <i>autism spectrum disorder</i> AND <i>folic acid</i>, AND, with the use of the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH): autistic OR <i>autism</i> AND <i>autistic spectrum disorder</i> AND <i>folic acid</i>.  Data extraction was performed by the reviewers with a preestablished data collection formulary.  The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) was used based on a checklist with 27 items and a 4-step flowchart.  A total of 384 articles was found by the search strategies, of which 17 were eligible following the pre-established criteria. The main findings of the present review point to maternal FA supplementation in the pre-conception period and beginning of pregnancy as a protective effect in relation to ASD, which should be indicated in this period as prevention to the problem.  According to the research analyzed, more studies are necessary to know its effects on pregnancy, since the consumption of excessive FA may not be innocuous.
