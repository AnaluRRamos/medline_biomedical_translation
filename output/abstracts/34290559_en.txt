This study aims to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the lever sign test in patients with and without chronic Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injuries in an outpatient setting and the inter-examiner agreement of surgeons with different levels of experience. 72 consecutive patients with a history of previous knee sprains were included. The Lachman, anterior drawer, and Lever Sign tests were performed for all subjects in a randomized order by three blinded raters with different levels of experience. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and inter-rater agreement were estimated for all tests. Among the 72 patients, the prevalence of ACL injuries was 54%. The lever test showed sensitivity of 64.1% (95% CI 0.47-0.78) and specificity of 100% (95% CI 0.87-1.00) for the senior examiner. For the less experienced examiner the sensitivity was 51.8% and the specificity was 93.7%. Positive predictive values (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) were 100% and 70.2%, respectively. Lever Sign test shows to be a maneuver of easy execution, with 100% specificity and 100% PPV. Moderate agreement between experienced examiners and low agreement among experienced and inexperienced examiners was found. This test may play a role as an auxiliary maneuver. <b>Level of Evidence I, Diagnostic Studies - Investigating a Diagnostic Test.</b>
