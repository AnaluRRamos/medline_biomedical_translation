The aim was to analyze the level and characterize the use of clinical coordination mechanisms between levels of care, and their associated factors, in two public networks of health services in Mexico. A cross-sectional study was carried out using the COORDENA questionnaire to primary and specialized care physicians in the state of Veracruz. Differences were found between networks and levels of care, according to the mechanism. In both, the referral/counter-referral is mostly used to channel the patient to another level, mainly by primary care physicians. A high reception of referrals by specialists was identified, but few counterreferences in primary care. Being a man and recognizing the primary care physician, as responsible for monitoring the patient in his/her healthcare career, were factors associated with the frequent sending of the counter-referral by specialists. The discharge report is used in both networks to send clinical information to the other level, with more sending by specialist doctors, but with less reception in primary care. In both networks, the follow-up to the recommendations of the mechanisms to standardize clinical care was greater by primary care physicians than specialized ones. The use of coordination mechanisms between levels of care is deficient and limited, with greater use of mechanisms to transfer information than for clinical management. The need to implement strategies that consider the participation of professionals is evident, to favor local adaptation, appropriation and improve their use.
