This study aimed to determine the presence and association of possible mental disorders diagnoses in primary care pregnant women and newborns' conditions. This is a longitudinal study with pregnant women (18-39 years), in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, attended at primary care facilities in the metropolitan region of São Paulo (February to August/2014). The following tools were used: sociodemographic questionnaire; Mental Disorders in Primary Care Assessment tool; and an interview with information and mother´s perception of the behavior of newborns. Of the 300 pregnant women interviewed, 76 had possible diagnosis of mental disorders, 46 women had depression/dysthymia and 58 anxiety/panic symptoms. Low birth weight and prematurity was observed in 14 and 19 newborns, respectively, and there was no association with the probable diagnosis of mental disorders; the possible presence of mental disorders was associated with the mother's perception of newborns behavior. Pregnant women attended at low risk prenatal care showed relevant frequency of mental disorders; thus, the identification of these changes during pregnancy can also contribute to a better understanding of the mother-and-child dynamics and in the quality of family care.
