Atopic dermatitis (AD) is one of the most common skin diseases in dogs. Monitoring the progress of treatment may include assessment of lesion severity by use of Canine Atopic Dermatitis Extent and Severity Index (CADESI), assessment of pruritus and measurement of biophysical parameters of the skin. This study aimed to assess changes in transepidermal water loss (TEWL) during 12 weeks of treatment with lokivetmab and its correlation with the CADESI-04 and the severity of pruritus. Ten client-owned dogs with canine AD. The animals were administered lokivetmab three times at four week intervals. Pruritus and CADESI-04 were assessed, and TEWL was measured at six body regions, on Day 0 and repeated at weeks 4, 8 and 12. There was a significant decrease in the CADESI-04 score, the severity of pruritus and the mean TEWL between baseline and each of the time points. TEWL also decreased in the majority of body sites examined. Significant correlations between the CADESI-04 and mean TEWL (r = 0.519, P = 0.0003), and between pruritus severity and mean TEWL (r = 0.517, P = 0.0003), were found. Overall TEWL decreased during lokivetmab treatment but not at all body sites. If TEWL is used to assess the effectiveness of a treatment, a mean TEWL score should be calculated from several areas of the body.
