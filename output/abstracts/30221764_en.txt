Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibodies have a strong association with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) in children, and bilateral and recurrent optic neuritis in children and adults. Recent reports suggest that seizures and encephalopathy may occur in children and adults with MOG antibody-associated disease. We describe the clinical, laboratory, and radiological course of four MOG antibody-positive children who first presented with isolated seizures without fulfilling clinical or radiological criteria for ADEM or other central nervous system demyelination syndromes, who months to years later developed more typical demyelination. This case series highlights a novel observation that isolated seizures in the absence of ADEM may be the index presentation for MOG antibody-associated disease, which should therefore be considered a form of autoimmune epilepsy. It would be reasonable to test for MOG antibodies in children with seizures accompanied by subtle inflammatory changes on magnetic resonance imaging or cerebrospinal fluid analyses, particularly if followed by demyelination, given the clinical and therapeutic implications of an expedited diagnosis in minimizing long-term disability. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Isolated seizures in the absence of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis may be the index presentation for myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated demyelination.
