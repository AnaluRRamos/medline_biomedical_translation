This paper aims to evaluate the prevalence of breastfeeding among premature infants following hospital discharge. Cohort (< 33 gestation weeks) followed up to 12 months (adjusted age). breastfeeding, anthropometric measurements, social and family information. The proportion of breastfeeding during follow-up was calculated. Survival analysis was conducted to estimate breastfeeding duration. In total, 242 of the 258 infants (93.7%) returned to follow-up; 170 (69.9%) at 6 months and 139 (57.2%) at 12 months (adjusted age). A history of miscarriages (27.5%), stillbirths (11.7%), neonatal deaths (9.5%) and preterm births (21.1%) was noted in 65.5% of women. At hospital discharge: 5.5% received exclusive breastfeeding, 65.8% breastfeeding and formula, 28.6% formula. At month 1, 81.3% received breastfeeding, decreasing to 68.5% at month 2, 62.4% at month 3, 48.1% at month 4 and 22.4% at month 6 (adjusted age). The median of breastfeeding duration was 4 months. Breastfeeding occurred up to four months adjusted age in almost half of the population. Despite the need to improve these rates, the results could reflect the profile of the Child-Friendly Hospital Initiative Unit. Maintaining breastfeeding amongst preterm infants following hospital discharge is still a challenge, for both mothers and health professionals.
