To identify which aspects of primary health care management, evidenced in current literature, can influence manager workloads. Integrative literature review with data collection conducted in April 2016, in five databases, with articles published in English, Spanish and Portuguese between 2006 and 2016. The results of the 78 studies were organized into two macro categories: increased workloads, especially due to the challenge of managing a new care model and deficits in working conditions; and workloads reduction related to the training of the teams and managers, the autonomy and the support for the managers. In addition to identifying factors that increase and decrease the workloads of managers, this study highlights the promising line of research, given the importance of management for the health sector and effectiveness of Primary Health Care.
