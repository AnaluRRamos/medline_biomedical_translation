Deep vein thrombosis, whose prevalence remains unknown in the pediatric population, is an increasingly common diag- nosis in this age group. This increased incidence makes the post-thrombotic syndrome a likely long-term complication, so there is a critical need to establish high quality evidence over its suitable approach in this population. We present two cases of deep vein thrombosis in children and their management in a hospital of the northern region of Portugal, reviewing the literature on this under researched subject. In conclusion, further investigation is needed to assess the incidence, the prevalence, the predictors and the safety and efficacy of therapies for the prevention and appropriate treatment of deep vein thrombosis in children and eventual post- -thrombotic syndrome.
