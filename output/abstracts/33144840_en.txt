To assess whether Bare Spot is previously displaced by proportion (MEASURE BP-A Ã— 1.25/MEASURE BP-P = 1). 35 patients with surgical indication for rotator cuff injury repair were evaluated. The distances from the Bare Spot to the anterior edge of the glenoid cavity (BS-A) and to the posterior edge (BS-P) were measured by arthroscopy and computed tomography with three-dimensional reconstruction of the scapula. The distance from the Bare Spot to the anterior border (BS-A tc) was 11.6 mm with a median 12 mm; The distance to the posterior border (BS-P tc) was on average 15.5 mm with a median 15 mm. The distances from BS to anterior cavity edge measured by arthroscopy were on average (BS-A video) 12.25 mm with a median of 12 mm, and from BS to posterior edge (BS-P video) 16.25 mm on average with median 16 mm (<i>p</i> < 0.005). Bare Spot is displaced anteriorly at a proportion of 40% of the anterior margin and 60% of the posterior margin. <b><i>Level of Evidence II - Development of diagnostic criteria on consecutive patients (with universally applied reference 'gold standard').</i></b>
