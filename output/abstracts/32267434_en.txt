More than 30 years into the anniversary of the Unified Health System (SUS), 40 years after Alma-Ata, and soon after the Astana Conference, the Brazilian Ministry of Health proposes several strategies to strengthen PHC with the creation of the Primary Health Care Secretariat (SAPS). This paper presents the process of developing the national PHC service portfolio, one of the strategies developed by SAPS to strengthen the PHC clinic, and the challenges for the expansion of comprehensive care in the actions developed by the Family Health and Oral Health teams. After the public consultation, from a total of 209 initially listed actions and procedures, including incorporations and exclusions, 210 items were defined, including the actions planned for the integration between primary care and health surveillance. We emphasize that the national portfolio model can be adapted to the reality and municipal context in each of the federation units, including considering the availability of the local care network.
