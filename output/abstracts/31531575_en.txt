This is a study on the way science and scientists are represented in short films on science and technology featured in Anima Mundi Festival (1993-2013), considering symbolic elements that contribute to the image of science. Amongst 405 films on science and technology, 102 were selected for analysis. Brazilian productions predominated (91), as did films featuring genetics, biotechnology, and astronomy. The narratives mostly address technology development, ethical considerations, and explanations of scientific processes. Scientists appear in 80% of the films - mostly white men, wearing a white coat or uniform, in secret laboratories. Scientists' presence in public spaces - stages, the media, industry - indicates a call for their greater visibility in society.
