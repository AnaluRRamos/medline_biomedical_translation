Increased life expectancy has led to a significant number of elderly enrolling on Youth and Adult Education programs (YAE). These individuals leave inactivity and negative aspects of aging in search of opportunities for social inclusion. To evaluate the influence of sociodemographic factors and depressive and cognitive symptoms on quality of life (QL) of elderly attending the YAE of São Carlos city in São Paulo state. A descriptive and quantitative study approved by the Research Ethics Committee of São Carlos Federal University was conducted. The sample comprised all elderly undertaking the YAE literacy program in 2012. The instruments used were the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), WHOQOL-bref and WHOQOL-old, and a sociodemographic instrument. We interviewed 23 elderly, predominantly females (91.3%) in the early stages of old age (69.6%). The number of years of YAE study showed no correlation with cognition scores obtained on the MMSE or with QL domains. However, scores on the GDS had a moderate inverse relationship with total scores for the Physical (p<0.01), Sensory Functioning (p<0.05), Independence (p<0.01), Past, Present and Future Activities (p<0.05), Social Participation (p<0.01), and Intimacy (p<0.05) QV domains, and a strong inversely proportional relationship with the Social Relationships QV domain (p<0.01). Scores attained on the MMSE showed a moderate and direct relationship with total scores on the Independence QL domain (p=0.001). Elderly on literacy programs have average quality of life scores. Several QL domains are influenced by depression and cognitive symptoms.
