The purpose of this study was to determine and compare a magnitude of the association between anthropometric indicators with risk of cardiometabolic risk in the elderly. This is a cross-sectional study with 402 elderly people attended by the Family Health Strategy in the city of Vi√ßosa-MG. Risk factors for excess body fat, hypertension, blood glucose and serum lipid changes. An association between conicity index (CI) and waist-to-height ratio (WtHR) with cardiometabolic risk factors was assessed by multiple linear regression analysis. Sample was composed of 60.4% of women and 36.3% of overweight elderly. The connectivity index and a waist-to-height ratio were higher in 57.2% and 88.1% in the elderly, respectively. The results showed that the increase in body fat, diastolic blood pressure, triglycerides, glycemia and reduction of HDL-cholesterol are related to higher values of anthropometric indices evaluated. However, the waist-to-height ratio presented a greater magnitude of association with the cardiometabolic risk factors than the connectivity index.
