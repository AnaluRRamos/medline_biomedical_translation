To describe the characteristics of the heel prick test in newborns admitted to the intensive care unit of a university hospital as well as to determine whether maternal and fetal conditions could have affected the results of this test. Retrospective longitudinal study with a quantitative approach that evaluated 240 medical records. The data collected were analyzed by descriptive statistical analysis. There was a predominance of pregnant women aged 20 to 34 years who had a complete secondary education and who had more than six prenatal care visits. Maternal complications or pathologies occurred in 60% of the mothers, and most (67.5%) did not present any condition that could have affected the heel prick test results. Most newborns were premature and exhibited low birth weight. Approximately 90% of newborns exhibited conditions that could have influenced the test, especially prematurity, parenteral nutrition and blood transfusion. Of the 240 newborns, 25% had abnormal heel prick test results, especially for cystic fibrosis and congenital adrenal hyperplasia. There are maternal and neonatal conditions that can affect heel prick test results, and therefore, their investigation is essential, aiming to guide measures that promote mother and child health and consolidate neonatal screening in this population.
