To evaluate the outcomes of patients that underwent arthroscopic surgery for lateral epicondylitis (LE), after failed conservative treatment. One hundred four patients with LE treated with arthroscopic debridement of the extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB) tendon were enrolled in this retrospective study. They were evaluated using Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) scale. Mean age at surgery was 46.9 years. Duration of symptoms was 2.1 years (range: 6 m to 10 yrs.). Mean follow-up was 34.4 months (range: 6 to 68 m). Mean postoperative scores were: 20.67 points on the DASH; 1.8 points on the VAS at rest, with 48 cases (46%) without pain, 40 (38%) with mild pain, 13 (13%) with moderate pain and 4 (4%) with severe pain; 4.7 points on the VAS in activity, with 21 (20%) without pain, 21 (20%) with mild pain, 35 (34%) with moderate pain and 27 (26%) with severe pain; and SF-36 was 66.8 points. Of the 23 patients who practiced sports regularly or with higher physical demand from the upper limbs, 17 (74%) were able to return to the same activity at the same level. No significant complications were observed postoperatively, except for 3 (2.8%) cases of postoperative superficial infection. Surgical treatment with arthroscopy for recalcitrant LE is effective and safe, presenting positive outcomes in the studied patients. <b><i>Level of evidence IV, Case Series.</i></b>
