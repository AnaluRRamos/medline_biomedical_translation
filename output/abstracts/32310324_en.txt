Effective environmental disinfection is necessary to prevent nosocomial infections from meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP). However, there are currently no commercial disinfectant sprays or fogging systems with label claims against MRSP. To evaluate the efficacy of a quaternary ammonium product (QAC), an accelerated hydrogen peroxide product (AHP), a hydrogen peroxide and silver product (HAL), and a hydrogen peroxide and silver fogging system (FOG) against MRSP. Sterile plastic surfaces inoculated with MRSP were treated with 200 µL of QAC, AHP or HAL for the recommended contact times. For FOG, inoculated samples were placed in eight positions within a sealed room before fogging for the recommended contact time. Post-treatment bacterial counts were compared to untreated positive controls. Sterile uninoculated surfaces served as negative controls. Least-squares mean reduction (log<sub>10</sub> ) in colony forming units (cfu) was 3.55 log<sub>10</sub> for QAC (P < 0.0001), 3.60 log<sub>10</sub> for AHP (P < 0.0001), 1.66 log<sub>10</sub> for HAL (P < 0.0001) and 0.32 log<sub>10</sub> for FOG (P = 0.004). QAC, AHP and HAL reduced MRSP cfu by 99.97%, 99.98% and 97.81%, respectively. FOG reduced cfu by 52.14%. QAC and AHP effectively disinfected surfaces inoculated with MRSP. Although HAL provided lower MRSP reduction, it may be considered clinically acceptable. FOG as a sole means of MRSP disinfection was not supported yet may have utility as an adjunctive disinfectant in clinical areas with bacterial densities lower than our experimental inoculum.
