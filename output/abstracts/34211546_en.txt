There is a dearth of studies conducted to understand the socio-professional profile of the vascular surgery specialty and the population demands of specific regions, which are needed to support creation of care policies and direct infrastructure improvements in healthcare. The purpose of this study was to describe the socio-professional profile of vascular surgeons in the state of Pará, Brazil, to guide creation of tools for professional improvement. A cross-sectional, self-report survey was conducted in Pará using a questionnaire comprising 30 questions covering six main topics. All vascular surgeons actively practicing in the state participated in this study. The total number of specialists was 59, with 71.2% working in the greater Belém area and 16.9% exclusively practicing in the interior of the state. The mean age of these professionals was 48 ± 11.1 years, 86.4% of respondents were men, 64.4% of surgeons had completed medical residency, and 96.6% (n=57) of the surgeons would like to improve their skills in venous surgery, echo-guided vascular access, and endovascular surgery. The method of professional improvement of greatest interest was simulation courses (hands-on), endorsed by 93% of the participants. Pará has 59 vascular surgeons. These professionals mainly work in the greater Belém (71.2%), in hospitals (100%) or in private clinics or offices (94.9%), performing a wide range of procedures, including venous and arterial surgery, amputations, and provision of hemodialysis access. More than 90% of these surgeons were satisfied professionally and reported that they would choose the specialty again. However, 22% had a pessimistic view of the specialty's future. The vast majority of professionals (96.6%) consider that training or a continuing education program are necessary.
