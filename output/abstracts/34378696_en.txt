This article aims to identify factors associated with full satisfaction with prenatal care in health services in Porto Alegre (RS), Brazil. This is a cross-sectional study with 287 women that attended prenatal care in the state capital. Women were randomly selected at two large maternity hospitals (public and private) and interviewed at their homes around 30 days after delivery, from January to August 2016. Satisfaction was measured by a Likert scale (very satisfied to very unsatisfied). Prevalence ratios (PR) were estimated by Poisson regression with robust variance, using a hierarchical model. Factors associated with greater satisfaction were higher education (PR=1.49; 95% CI: 1.08-2.06); multiprofessional care (PR=1.29; 95% CI: 1.00-1.66); receiving information about breastfeeding (PR=1.33; 95% CI: 1.05-1.68) and place of delivery (PR=1.56; 95% CI: 1.12-2.17); and women feeling comfortable asking questions and participating in decisions (PR=5.17; 95% CI: 1.79-14.96). The findings suggest that prenatal care services that offer multiprofessional care, provide guidance, and make pregnant women feel comfortable asking and deciding about their care may generate greater satisfaction.
