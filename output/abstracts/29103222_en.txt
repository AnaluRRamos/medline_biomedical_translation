The aortobifemoral bypass (AFB) is one of the best options to revascularize patients with Aortoiliac Occlusive Disease (AIOD). The impact of this procedure in sexual function (SF) is unpredictable, with 0 to 80% of the patients reporting sexual dysfunction (SD) after surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate SD after AFB and to assess the importance of patent hypogastric arteries before the procedure. The study includes only male population submitted to AFB due to AIOD from between January 2013 and March 2016 in Centro Hospital São João (CHSJ). Patients with major amputations after the surgery or dead were excluded. The development of SD was evaluated by phone call. The quality of life before and after the procedure was evaluated by a standardized index score questionnaire (15D). Pre-operative patency of hypogastric arteries was appraised by assessing the patients imaging file. The arteries with direct anterograde flow were considered patent. Of a total of 53 patients, 40 were included in the study - 37% reported worsening, 26% improved and 37% didn't notice any change in SF after surgery. Exclusion causes were intrahospital death (5.7%), natural cause death (9.4%) and major amputation (11.3%). If at least one of the hypogastric arteries was patent before surgery, 51.1% described worsening in SF compared to only 7.1% in the group with no sustained anterograde flow to the hypogastric arteries (p<0.001). The majority of the group (92.1%), wasn't warned of the possibility of SD after surgery, being that 26.3% of these would have refused the procedure if they knew. SD is a prevalent and often overlooked complication after open aortoiliac revascularization and it remains a major taboo in the surgeon/patient relation. The existence of at least one hypogastric artery with preserved anterograde flow before surgery can strongly predict a higher risk of SD after surgery.
