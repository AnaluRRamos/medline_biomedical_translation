Equine pastern vasculitis is an uncommon disorder in horses. Underlying causes are difficult to assess, especially bacterial infections. A 13-year-old French saddle gelding horse presented for evaluation of a six weeks history of pastern dermatitis. Histopathological examination of skin biopsy samples revealed small vessel vasculitis. A pure growth of a multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MRPA) was obtained from a deep skin biopsy. Clinical remission was observed after a six week course of enrofloxacin and lesions did not recur. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of a pastern vasculitis associated with MRPA and successfully treated with a six week course of enrofloxacin.
