To perform a systematic review of the main methods and indications of interposition arthroplasty in the rigid elbow. The research was carried out by three independent researchers, in the databases PubMed, Medline and Embase, according to the descriptors selected as a research strategy and filters selected in the inclusion criteria. In total, 21 studies were found with the afore mentioned descriptors and which were considered adequate according to the design and relevance according to the type of study and inclusion filters. There was a very strong correlation between the searches of the three researchers (k = 0.809). At the end, 14 complete studies were presented, all of which were included. The main finding of this study was to note that there is an evident lack of research with a high level of real effectiveness and indication for interposition arthroplasty in the rigid elbow. Most studies point to positive results when the patient is young and a total arthroplasty is not indicated. No meta-analysis or randomized clinical trial was found for this specific topic, despite being a technique applied in clinical practice for some decades and showing good results. <b><i>Level of Evidence V, Systematic Review.</i></b>
