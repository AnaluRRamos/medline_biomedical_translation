To show the morphometric patterns of lymph nodes of the head and neck, evaluating their number, shape, dimensions, hilum, and cortex, through the use of ultrasound examination of the neck. We analyzed 400 right and left lymph nodes in a group of 20 healthy young and middle-aged individuals of both genders. In the ultrasound examination, we observed the following lymph nodes: mastoid; parotid (superficial, extraglandular, and intraglandular); submandibular (preglandular, retroglandular, and intracapsular); submental; and cervical (anterior and posterior). Although some individuals had up to seven lymph nodes in the same region, most had only two to three per region. The smallest lymph node diameter observed was 0.4 cm, and the largest was 2.7 cm. Most lymph nodes showed an elongated or oval shape. Most of the lymph node hila were echogenic, although a few were hyperechoic. However, the cortex was clearly hypoechoic in all of the lymph nodes evaluated. Ultrasound examination of healthy individuals allowed the characteristics of the lymph nodes of the head and neck to be observed clearly, which could provide a basis for the analysis of patients with diseases of these lymph nodes.
