To demonstrate whether or not there is a correlation between the risk factors for gonarthrosis and the radiographic classification of Ahlb채ck. We studied patients with primary gonarthrosis attended at the knee outpatient clinic of the General Hospital of Vila Penteado during their routine visit. We collected data on patient age (years), weight (kg), height (meters), body mass index (BMI = patient weight/height<sup>2</sup>), personal history of hypertension or diabetes mellitus (positive or negative), sedentarism (physical activity less than three times per week, 30 minutes per session), functional demand (how many blocks walked weekly), time of onset of symptoms (in years) and laterality or bilaterality. The data were correlated with the Ahlb채ck classification applied to the radiographs performed at the time of the consultation. A sample of 108 patients was studied. We did not find an association between the Ahlb채ck classification and the patient's age, smoking, sedentary lifestyle, laterality, number of blocks walked per week, diabetes mellitus, and sex; however, a positive association was observed in hypertensive patients as well as a weak correlation with height and weight of the patient and moderate correlation with BMI. The Ahlb채ck classification is unrelated to most of the risk factors for primary gonarthrosis. <b><i>Level of evidence III, Case-control study.</i></b>
