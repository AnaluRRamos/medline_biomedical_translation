This text assesses the impact of the Cabanis reform on the formation of the health training model which became hegemonic in Brazil. First, we shall briefly discuss the process of constructing the social, ideological, and institutional framework for healthcare in post-revolutionary France. Next the main elements of the Cabanis reform are introduced, analyzing curricular and pedagogical aspects of the new plan for medical education based on professionalism, disciplines, and expertise that resulted in a system of higher education without universities. This is followed by assessment of the historical process which resulted in the 'Francization' of the Brazilian educational system, particularly in higher education and more specifically medical education, producing a model of health training based on colleges, hospitals, classrooms, disciplines, skills, and diplomas.
