to evaluate the perception of surgeons, members of the Brazilian College of Surgeons (CBC), on safety and quality issues in surgery, based on projects of Brazilian Ministry of Health (MS), CBC, World Health Organization (WHO), and American College of Surgeons (ACS). a questionnaire based on WHO, CBC, and ACS initiatives was sent to all active and non-active CBC members, using Survey Monkey, in March 2018. out of 7,100 members, 171 professionals answered the questionnaire. Out of these, the majority (63.2%) declared to perform general surgery, 88.9% indicated knowing the project called Safe Surgery developed by MS, 73.1%, the CBC manual, and 14.6%, the ACS Strong for Surgery. Among those who indicated knowing the MS project, 73.1% said that they were accustomed to use it as a routine, and, among those who indicated knowing the CBC manual, 46.2% said that they were accustomed to use it. Most of the surgeons (81.3%) indicated that they had experienced severe surgical failures, being failures related to surgical material (49.7%) and presence of foreign bodies (8.2%) the most common ones. There were distinct opinions on who was responsible for checking over the checklist. the importance of safety and quality in surgery is well known by surgeons, but the practice is varied. Serious adverse events had been experienced by many surgeons, mainly related to surgical material and foreign bodies. The concept of interdisciplinarity did not seem to be common practice. Data indicated the need to develop education projects and the obligation of audits.
