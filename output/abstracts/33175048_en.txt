Coparticipants in the performance, planning, and control of public policies' implementation, Health Councils are public spaces aiming at the participation and social control of health actions concerning the community. Access to information is a crucial condition so that not only advisers but also civil society can propose, monitor, and evaluate the actions taken in health. Based on this understanding and the guidance provided by Law NÂ° 141/2012 on the visibility of SUS management instruments, this study aimed to verify how the municipal portals of Brazilian capitals have disseminated their Health Councils and the necessary instruments for analyzing, monitoring, and following-up on the health policy. While recommended by law, the research showed that dissemination occurs differently between capitals. Only 14% of the investigated portals make SUS management instruments available on the council pages, and 33% do not disclose information about the council or management instruments. The lack of such content can weaken the council's institutionality and, ultimately, participatory democracy itself.
