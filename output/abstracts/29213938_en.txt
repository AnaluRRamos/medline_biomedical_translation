Deep brain stimulator (DBS) implant surgery is considered a breakthrough in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, especially in cases where motor symptoms cannot be controlled through conventional drug treatment. Its benefits have been studied extensively in the literature, particularly in relation to motor symptoms. However, the disease's cognitive aspects have been studied to a lesser extent. This systematic review aims to assess the effects of DBS surgery on motor and cognitive symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease. The search strategy included MEDLINE, LILACs, SCIELO and the Cochrane Library. Randomized clinical trials with DBS surgical intervention and Parkinson's disease were included. Of the 178 studies identified, 19 met the eligibility criteria. These studies were descriptively analyzed as regards to their results. Control of motor symptoms, as assessed by the UPDRS Part III scale, was found in all of the studies, pointing to great interest in this outcome and demonstrating an advantage of DBS over conventional drug treatment. Regarding cognitive aspects, heterogeneity in the choice of subjects studied and the use of different assessment tools for each was evident, hampering comparisons and leading to inconclusive results. This review provides a broad overview of the effects of DBS on Parkinson's disease symptoms. However, it is suggested that future studies be conducted to establish a gold-standard protocol for neuropsychological assessment, thereby enabling data comparison and more consistent conclusions.
