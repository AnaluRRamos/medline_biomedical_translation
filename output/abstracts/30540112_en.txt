To describe the socioeconomic and nutritional characteristics of children and adolescents with sickle cell anemia. The present study is a systematic literature review based on published scientific articles. The searches were carried out using the electronic database of the National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health- PubMed. Two searches of articles published in the last 20years and without limitation of language were carried out. Thefirst one started from the Medical Subject Headings term 'Anemia, Sickle Cell' associated with 'Socioeconomic Factors'; and the second started from the term 'Anemia, Sickle Cell' associated with 'Anthropometry'. Thesearches were directed to research conducted on humans in the age group from 0 to 18years. The final selection was composed by 11 articles on socioeconomic characteristics and 21articles on nutritional characteristics. Allstudies included children and adolescents with sickle cells disease (age range 0-18years), both genders, and most of them of black ethnicity. Families of children and adolescents with sickle cell anemia were of predominantly low socioeconomic status. Parents had lower educational levels when compared to parents of healthy children and adolescents. Body measurements (weight and height) and anthropometric indicators of children with sickle cell anemia were often lower when compared to healthy groups or reference populations. Children and adolescents with sickle cell anemia have socioeconomic limitations and worse nutritional conditions, when compared to reference populations. These limitations may lead to worse growth and greater occurrence of possible complications that can impair their quality of life.
