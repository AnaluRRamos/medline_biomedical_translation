Disparities in prostate cancer care have been evidenced and associated with sociodemographic and clinical factors, which establish the time for diagnosis and initiation of treatment. To evaluate the association of sociodemographic and clinical variables with the onset of prostate cancer treatment. This is a prospective longitudinal cohort study with secondary data with a population of men with prostate cancer attended in the periods 2010-2011 and 2013-2014 at the Santa Rita de Cássia Hospital in Vitória, Espírito Santo, Brazil. The study population consisted of 1,388 men. Of the total, those younger than 70 years (OR = 1.85; CI = 1.49-2.31), nonwhite (OR = 1.30; CI = 1.00-1.70), less than 8 years of schooling (OR = 1.52; CI = 1.06-2.17) and referred by the Unified Health System services (OR = 2.52; CI = 1.84-3.46) were more likely to have a delayed treatment. Similarly, the lower the Gleason score (OR = 1.78; CI = 1.37-2.32) and Prostate-Specific Antigens levels (OR = 2.71; CI = 2.07-3.54), the greater the likelihood of delay for the onset of treatment. Therefore, sociodemographic and clinical characteristics exerted a strong influence on the access to prostate cancer treatment.
