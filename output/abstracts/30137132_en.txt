Pemphigus is a group of autoimmune blistering diseases that affect the skin and mucous membranes, the global incidence of which is 0.75 to 5 / 1.000.000 cases a year. The approach taken derives from the relations of power/truth and subjectivity that produce modes of experience from the perspective of hospitals and public policies. It involves cartographic qualitative research, supported from a Deleuzian standpoint. The objective was to discuss pemphigus as a chronic disease and discuss health policies and their impact on care practices. This cartography was conducted in a philanthropical hospital, which is a national reference for the treatment of pemphigus. The research was conducted from September 2012 to February 2013. The analysis of materials included: medical records, field diary reports of all healthcare activities, such as medical consultations, technical procedures performed by nursing staff and medical staff and reports of patients, families, physicians, and nursing staff. The analyses were created from a Foucauldian historical and genealogical perspective. The conclusion reached is that health policies for chronic patients with pemphigus are not presented as a condition to be avoided / prevented, but as abnormal groups and bio identities that have no effect on the whole population.
