To define the anthropometric profile of the knee in a Brazilian population with gonarthrosis using intraoperative measurements; and to evaluate the compatibility of three implants available for total knee arthroplasty. Morphometric data were collected prospectively from 117 subjects with gonarthrosis. Six dimensions in the distal femur and two in the proximal tibia were documented in 118 knees while performing total arthroplasty. These data were compared with the dimensions of three implants available for total knee arthroplasty. The statistical analysis showed that more than a quarter of the patients presented an unsatisfactory relationship between the knee and prosthesis. The implants evaluated need to be adjusted to better fit Brazilian patients.
