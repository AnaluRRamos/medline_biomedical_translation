This study compared standardised rates of hospitalisations due to ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSCs) in Brazil's Federal District from 2009 to 2018, as compared with those for selected state capitals, age groups and admissions groups. This ecological study used secondary data drawn from Hospital Information System microdata for the study period, during which, in the Federal District, the proportion of such admissions among 50-59 and 60-69 year olds declined, while those among children and adolescents held stable. Meanwhile, rates did not decrease in the â‰¤ 20 year age groups, a priority population in PHC, which may suggest that this population encountered barriers to access. The results showed that the expected reduction in the proportion of such admissions has not occurred, because coverage by Family Health Teams has been expanded only recently.
