Studies into violence in the eighteenth century tend to address questions related to justice and criminality, but not health. The aim of this study is to understand how, in eighteenth century Minas Gerais, Brazil, bodies were affected by violent acts. The investigation records from the parish of Vila Rica held at the historical archive of the Museu da InconfidÃªncia were investigated. The results showed crimes of different kinds associated with a variety of motives, primarily crimes against the body, with the resulting bodily injuries being caused by sharp or pointed objects/instruments. There were more male victims than female, the head being the principal part of the body affected. Criminal and violent acts, very commonplace in this society, interfered in the health and disease processes of the bodies.
