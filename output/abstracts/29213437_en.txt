Dementia is a global socio-medical problem. The steepest increase in prevalence occurs in Latin-America and Asia. European governments have implemented dementia plans to improve care. We describe common goals of European dementia plans and discuss the Brazilian situation. Sixteen European countries have governmental dementia plans, another four are set to launch them. These plans have some common goals: to raise general awareness on dementia and reduce stigma, to establish more diagnostic centers and increase the number of people with correct diagnoses, to provide integrated care that improves quality of care and quality of life, and to promote educational programs for family and professional carers. European dementia plans have contributed toward raising awareness about dementia. More reference centers for diagnostic evaluations have been established and successful educational programs have been run. Integrated care is still a challenge in most countries. Brazil needs a plan. Facilitators and barriers for implementation should be identified by studying the European plans.
