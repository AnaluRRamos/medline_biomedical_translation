The scope of this study was to analyze, from the standpoint of managers, the conformity of the process of regionalization in health in Brazil, with emphasis on the main advances and challenges. A mixed exploratory and descriptive study was conducted. In the first stage, an electronic questionnaire was given to managers from all health regions of the country. In the second stage, focus groups were staged with managers in all macro regions. A semi-structured interview was used to encourage managers to speak about the advances and main challenges of the process of regionalization. The data was analyzed using Iramuteq software, more specifically the Descending Hierarchical Classification (DHC), resulting in three main themes: the first deals with the efforts made for the regional organization at the macro level of management, with emphasis on reducing inequalities, actions and services to users; the second demonstrates the regional organization and the difficulties for the organization of the local system; the third reveals difficulties in accessing health services, especially those with greater technological complexity. The research results point to advances and challenges, involving a risk for the structuring of the regionalization process, with bureaucratic and fragmentation implications.
