to analyze the time of decannulation and oral diet release of patients undergoing oral cancer surgery at the Hospital Alberto Cavalcante and to verify which factors are associated with the time of decannulation and oral diet release. an observational study of the database of 33 adult patients surgically treated with oral cancer and served between 2012 and 2017. The socio-demographic variables (age and gender) and clinical variables (type of surgery, surgical extension, type of reconstruction, clinical conditions and times of decannulation and reintroduction of the oral route) were collected through electronic medical records analysis. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed with measures of central tendency, dispersion and proportions. For the association analysis, the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test was used for independent samples. of the 33 participants, male and elderly predominated, 69.8% underwent resection of more than one structure. The median time of decannulation among patients with oral cancer was 8 days, and oral clearance of 9.5 days. Resections with more than one structure, the presence of fistula and dehiscence interfered in the oral release time. the median time of decannulation was eight days and oral release time of 9.5 days. Resections with more than one structure, the presence of fistula, and suture dehiscence are associated with increased oral release time.
