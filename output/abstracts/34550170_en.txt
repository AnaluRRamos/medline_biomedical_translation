The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with cardiovascular clinical manifestations, including cardiac arrhythmias. To assess the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias (atrial tachyarrhythmia, bradyarrhythmia, and sustained ventricular tachycardia) and cardiac arrest (CA) in a cohort of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in a tertiary university-affiliated hospital. Cohort study with retrospective analysis of electronic medical records. For comparison between groups, a value of p <0.05 was considered statistically significant We included 241 consecutive patients diagnosed with COVID-19 (mean age, 57.8 Â± 15.0 years; 51.5% men; 80.5% white), 35.3% of whom received invasive mechanical ventilation (MV). The overall mortality was 26.6%, being 58.8% among those on MV. Cardiac arrhythmias were identified in 8.7% of the patients, the most common being atrial tachyarrhythmia (76.2%). Patients with arrhythmias had higher mortality (52.4% <i>versus</i> 24.1%, p = 0.005). On multivariate analysis, only the presence of heart failure (HF) was associated with a higher risk of arrhythmias (hazard ratio, 11.9; 95% CI: 3.6-39.5; p <0.001). During hospitalization, 3.3% of the patients experienced CA, with a predominance of non-shockable rhythms. All patients experiencing CA died during hospitalization. The incidence of cardiac arrhythmias in patients admitted with COVID-19 to a Brazilian tertiary hospital was 8.7%, and atrial tachyarrhythmia was the most common. Presence of HF was associated with an increased risk of arrhythmias. Patients with COVID-19 experiencing CA have high mortality.
