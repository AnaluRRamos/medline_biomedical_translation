In addition to drug treatment, surgical intervention represents an alternative to PD patients with motor deficits. The most common intervention is subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS). It is extremely important to perform a neuropsychological assessment in patients with STN-DBS, not only to identify losses related to the disease, but also to compare influence on cognition both pre and postoperatively. the objective of this systematic review was to investigate the instruments frequently used in studies related to STN-DBS in PD patients. articles were retrieved from Medline/Pubmed databases published in the 2007-2017 period using PRISMA criteria. after analyzing 27 articles, the absence of a specific evaluation protocol for PD with STN-DBS was evident. non-motor symptoms are not given due importance in neuropsychological assessments. It is crucial to acknowledge that these symptoms have a major impact on the quality of life of patients. Greater engagement in assessing these aspects is required, in order to bridge the gaps in research.
