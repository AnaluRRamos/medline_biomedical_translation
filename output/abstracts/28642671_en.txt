To evaluate the functional and radiological results of Schatzker type II fractures treated via subchondral raft screws combined with locking plates. Twenty-four individuals were enrolled in this study between 2010 and 2014. The depressed joint line was elevated and the defect was filled with allograft. Next, two or three subchondral screws were placed in combination with a locking plate. At the last follow-up, clinical and radiological data were recorded. The mean follow-up period was 21.4 months (12-39). The mean Knee Society Score (KSS) and Rasmussen clinical scores were 91.5 (range, 77-100) and 16.75 (range, 14-18), respectively. The mean Rasmussen radiological score was 27.9 (range, 24-30) during the follow-up. There was no statistically significant difference between injured and non-injured sides with respect to the mechanical axis, the proximal medial tibial angle, and tibial slope. In addition, arthritis showed no difference on the non-injured side, although follow-up was short. The periarticular raft construction combined with the locking plate helps surgeon to maintain the anatomic line of the joint and the mechanical axis obtained during the surgery. Secondary arthritis seems to be major complication after fractures of the tibial plateau, although the functional results were satisfactory. <b><i>Level of Evidence IV, Case Series.</i></b>
