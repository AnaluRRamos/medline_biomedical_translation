To verify the validity evidence based on response processes of a vocabulary-screening tool. This is a descriptive, cross-sectional and quantitative study, applied in a sample of 133 children between 3 and 7 years of age, divided into five groups, according to their age range. This research evaluates the instrument TRILHAR, which is a screening of receptive and expressive vocabulary, composed by ten activities for each age range. The collected data were the application time in minutes and seconds, screening instructions comprehension and behavior during the screening. The data were analyzed descriptively as mean, standard deviation and percentage using the IBM SPSS Statistics. The application time was short, with less time for the greater ages. The mean time of application was 05m19s for G1, 04m29s for G2, 04m11s for G3, 03m40s for G4 and 02m13s for G5. Only one child (4.8%) from G2 required repetition of the instructions for the receptive vocabulary, and two children (6.3%) from G4 for the expressive vocabulary. We observed little occurrence of behaviors like disinterest, inattention and agitation. The application of the instrument required a short period, with a longer time for the group of 3-years children. The little necessity of repetition of the instructions indicates that children can easily comprehend the instrument.
