Maneuvering is a crucial locomotor strategy among aquatic vertebrates, common in routine swimming, feeding, and escape responses. Combinations of whole body and fin movements generate an imbalance of forces resulting in deviation from an initial path. Sharks have elongate bodies that bend substantially and, in combination with pectoral fin rotation, play a role in yaw (horizontal) turning, but previous studies focus primarily on maximal turning performance rather than routine maneuvers. Routine maneuvering is largely understudied in fish swimming, despite observations that moderate maneuvering is much more common than the extreme behaviors commonly described in the literature. In this study, we target routine maneuvering in the bonnethead shark, <i>Sphyrna tiburo</i>. We use video reconstruction of moving morphology to describe three-dimensional pectoral fin rotation about three axes to compare to those previously described on yaw turning by the Pacific spiny dogfish. We quantify kinematic variables to understand the impacts of body and fin movements on routine turning performance. We also describe the anatomy of bonnethead pectoral fins and use muscle stimulation to confirm functional hypotheses about their role in actuating the fin. The turning performance metrics we describe for bonnethead sharks are comparable to other routine maneuvers described for the Pacific spiny dogfish and manta rays. These turns were substantially less agile and maneuverable than previously documented for other sharks, which we hypothesize results from the comparison of routine turning to maneuvering under stimulated conditions. We suggest that these results highlight the importance of considering routine maneuvering in future studies.
