The face plays a central role in interpersonal relationships. Individuals with congenital or acquired facial deformities might experience difficulties with interpersonal relationships. Treatment should seek to improve their quality of life and work ability. To analyze the health-related quality of life and work ability of individuals with facial deformities. Study with mixed, quantitative and qualitative methods. We conducted semi-structured interviews on health-related quality of life and its implications for work with 16 individuals with facial deformities, eight cases of congenital and eight of acquired deformities, cared at specialized services in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil. The Work Ability Index (WAI) and 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey were administered. Thematic analysis led us to detect two categories of themes associated with facial deformities: interpersonal relationships and work ability; and quality of life and access to treatment. The participants with acquired facial deformities exhibited lower educational level and income, and lower quality of life and WAI scores compared to the ones with congenital deformities. All the participants with congenital deformities had received some form of rehabilitation and their social relationships were less impaired. Individuals with acquired facial deformities exhibited poorer work ability and quality of life compared to the ones with congenital deformities. Early rehabilitation of congenital deformities seems to considerably improve work ability and health-related quality of life.
