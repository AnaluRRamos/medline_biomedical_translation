We assess the expected long-run consequences of the unfolding COVID-19 pandemic and use these as a platform to argue that international business (IB) as a field should expand its research agenda to study the international division of labor.

This paradoxical, simultaneous occurrence of de-globalization and globalization offers rich opportunities for future IB research.
