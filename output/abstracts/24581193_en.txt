Choroidal neovascularization secondary to pathological myopia is one of the leading causes of irreversible central vision loss in younger patients. The purposes of our study is to evaluate the long-term results of antiangiogenic treatment, with ranibizumab and/or bevacizumab, in myopic choroidal neovascularization and define the predictive factors for visual and anatomic outcomes. In this study were included 84 eyes from 81 patients with myopic choroidal neovascularization. Eighty-four (100%) eyes accomplish 12 months of follow-up, 67 (79.8%) 24 months, 54 (64.3%) 36 months, 29 (34.5%) 48 months, and 15 (16.7%) 60 months. We retrieved data related to best corrected visual acuity measured with ETDRS chart, foveal center thickness on optical coherence tomography and fluorescein angiographic findings, before and after treatment. The best corrected visual acuity and foveal center thickness improvements were statistically significant for all follow-up times (p < 0.05). Mean baseline best corrected visual acuity was 43.7 ± 20.1 letters and mean baseline foveal center thickness was 304.8 ± 127.9 µm. Mean best corrected visual acuity was 55.6 ± 18.5, 52.1 ± 22.3, 52.1 ± 22.6, 50.3 ± 23.8 and 47.8 ± 24.5 for 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months of treatment, respectively. Mean foveal center thickness was 209.7 ± 86.2, 190.6 ± 76.1, 174.7 ± 60.6, 189.8 ± 96.7 and 159.4 ± 73.3 for the same follow-up times. Baseline best corrected visual acuity was the only predictive factor for better visual outcome (p < 0.001). Intravitreal anti-VEGF injections in patients with myopic choroidal neovascularization yielded a significant and sustained functional and anatomic improvement. Randomized long-term clinical trials are needed to determine the sustained efficacy of these drugs.
