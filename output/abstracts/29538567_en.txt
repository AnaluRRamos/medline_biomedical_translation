This study aims to describe the prevalence of heavy drinking, high-risk alcohol consumption and associated factors among tobacco farmers. A cross-sectional study was carried out with 2,469 tobacco farmers over 18 years old in 2011. High-risk alcohol consumption was considered the intake of three or more standard doses per day for men or two or more for women. Heavy drinking was considered the intake of four or more standard doses per day for men and three or more for women. Hierarchical multivariate analysis was performed to investigate the association with socioeconomic, behavioral, and occupational variables. : The prevalence of high-risk and heavy drinking was of 4.7% and 1.09% among women and 30.8% and 4.8% among men, respectively. The factors associated with high-risk drinking for men and women were the percentage of income tobacco accounted for (PR 1.3 and 0.4), being an employee (PR 1.3 and 3.1), and use of pesticides (PR 1.5 and 2.1), respectively. Heavy drinking among men was associated with losing the crop (PR 1.6), attending religious activities (PR 0.3), and hours working in agriculture (PR 0.6). Occupational factors were associated wit high-risk alcohol consumption among men. The associated factors vary according to the pattern of consumption assessed.
