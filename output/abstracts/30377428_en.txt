Adventitial cystic disease (ACD) of the radial artery is a rare condition, with few cases described in the literature. We report the case of a 62-year-old white male with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease with indications for renal replacement therapy who was found to have a cystic lesion of the radial artery while undergoing surgical creation of an arteriovenous fistula. The surgical technique adopted was resection of the cystic segment and preservation of the radial artery. Fistula creation was completed successfully. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of ACD are effective, and can prevent complications and recurrence.
