The High-Fidelity Simulation is a fundamental pedagogical method in the nursing student's teaching-learning process. An exploratory and descriptive study was performed by using a qualitative approach in order to understand the Nursing Degree course students' perception about the contribution of the Simulated High-Fidelity Practice for clinical competence learning. The self-filling questionnaire, composed of open questions and the technique of content analysis for the treatment of narrative material according to Bardin, was used. With the clinical scenario development, we emphasize the nursing students' perception in the learning of professional competences in three domains with greater focus in the field of care delivery and management. It was concluded that the High-fidelity Simulation is a fundamental pillar in the nursing students training, which reinforces the existing pedagogical practice. We stress the need to reformulate the scenarios in order to achieve a better learning balance in the different dimensions of their professional competences and to develop evaluation tools.
