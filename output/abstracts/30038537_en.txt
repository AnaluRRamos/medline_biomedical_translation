To evaluate postoperative epidemiological and functional factors in patients operated to treat duplicate thumb. This retrospective case series evaluated 20 patients (23 thumbs) treated from January 2012 to December 2016 at our service. Epidemiological and clinical factors were studied, including Tada score. Of the 34 children who were treated surgically, only 20 appeared for the functional evaluation and were included in the study. Of the operated cases, 60% were Wassel type 4. All evaluated cases had good functional results (Tada score â‰¥5, mean score: 6.65). The most frequently used surgical technique was resection of the radial thumb with reconstruction of the radial collateral ligament (47.8% of cases). Surgical correction of duplicated thumb yields good results, as long as attention is paid to abnormalities in bones, ligaments, and tendons. <b><i>Level of Evidence IV; Case series.</i></b>
