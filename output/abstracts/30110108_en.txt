When children becom cochlear implant users, they have already had the opportunity to develop phonological skills; however, it is possible that they miss sound information during speech and, consequently, present difficulties in competences associated with the learning of reading and writing. The study sample consisted of 11 normal hearing children aged 7-10 years and a right-ear cochlear implant user enrolled in the 3rd grade of Elementary School. The Cognitive-Linguistic Assessment protocol was used to evaluate the study participants. Data were transcribed and analyzed using descriptive statistics. The following sub-tests presented the highest percentage of children with superior performance: alphabet in sequence (82%), reading of pseudo-words (82%), syllable segmentation (73%), word repetition (82%), copying of shapes (72%), and rapid naming (100%).The cochlear implant user presented superior performance in all the sub-tests except for word repetition, in which average performance was observed. In the rhythm sub-test, none of the normal hearing children presented superior performance, and the cochlear implant user performed poorly. It was possible to observe that the condition of being a cochlear implant user is not the only determinant for a child's school failure. There are issues that go beyond auditory integrity, because some normal hearing children performed poorly in sub-tests such as repetition of pseudo-words, rhythm, and alliteration. The cochlear implant user presented a cognitive-linguistic profile very similar to those of his hearing peers.
