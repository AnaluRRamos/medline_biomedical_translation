The presence of clowns in hospitals is relatively recent and more than 700 organizations now perform clown therapy in hospitals in Brazil and around the world. Considering the emphasis on comprehensive care and the humanization of health, it is timely to understand and analyze the national and international scientific literature on clown therapy. This practice challenges the hegemonic biomedical model and potentially helps in the recuperation of health. A review of the literature was conducted and 18 publications were analyzed using thematic content analysis. The following categories arose from the analysis: physiological, behavioral, and emotional responses; presurgical anxiety and attribution of new meanings to practices and the hospital environment. Results have shown that clown therapy leads to a significant decrease in preoperative anxiety in children, even compared with the results obtained with the use of anesthesia-inducing drugs. Most studies investigated the use of clown therapy during patients' adaptation to hospitalization, helping them to attribute new meanings to this situation. Despite its low representation in the scientific field and the fact that it has not been widely accepted as a health practice, several studies have shown the benefits of using clown therapy in the hospital setting.
