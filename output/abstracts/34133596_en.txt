Coronary artery evaluation remains after arterial switch operation a clinical challenge. This study aims to correlate anatomical changes diagnosed by cardiac computed tomography (CCT) with physiological alterations on clinical evaluation to diagnose coronary obstruction in late ASO patients. This study included 61 consecutive patients with mean age of 9.4 years who underwent ASO. The patients were submitted to echocardiography, electrocardiography, cardiopulmonary exercise test, and cardiac computed tomography to evaluate functional capacity and coronary artery anatomy. Cardiac computed tomography revealed that only 3.3% of the patients had coronary stenosis. These patients were asymptomatic, and no signs of myocardial ischemia were detected by the tests. The incidence of coronary abnormalities in late ASO patients was 3.3% in our cohort. There is no clear guideline as to why, when, and how these patients should be screened or what to propose when a coronary obstruction is diagnosed in asymptomatic patients.
