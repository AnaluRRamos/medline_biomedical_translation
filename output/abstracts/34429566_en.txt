The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread quickly around the world. Although mainly a respiratory illness, there is growing interest in non-respiratory manifestations, particularly cardiovascular ones. At our center, mobilization of cardiologists with intensive care training was needed. Our aim is to describe patients with severe COVID-19 admitted to a Portuguese intensive care unit (ICU), the cardiovascular impact of the disease and the experience of cardiologists working in a COVID-19 ICU. Data from adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU of Centro Hospitalar de Vila Nova de Gaia/Espinho between 16 March 2020 and 21 April 2020 were analyzed retrospectively. Thirty-five patients were admitted. Mean age was 62.6±6.0 years and 23 (65.7%) were male. Dyslipidemia was the most common cardiovascular risk factor (65.7%, n=23), followed by hypertension (57.1%, n=20). Mean ICU stay time was 15.9±10.0 days. Patients had high rates of mechanical ventilation (88.6%, n=31) and vasopressor support (88.6%, n=31). Low rates of new onset left systolic dysfunction were detected (8.5%, n=2). One patient required venoarterial extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation. Mortality was 25% (n=9). Acute myocardial injury and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) elevation was detected in 62.9% (n=22). Patients that died had higher NT-proBNP compared to those discharged alive (p<0.05). Care by cardiologists frequently changed decision making. The cardiovascular impact of COVID-19 seems relevant but is still widely unknown. Studies are needed to clarify the role of cardiac markers in COVID-19 prognosis. Multidisciplinary care most likely results in improved patient care.
