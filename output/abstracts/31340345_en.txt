to analyze the relationship between perception of social support and emotional and physical symptoms associated with psychiatric conditions among women. a cross-sectional, quantitative study was carried out with a randomized random sample of 141 women attended at a Family Health Unit of the city of Ribeir√£o Preto/SP. A sociodemographic questionnaire, the Social Support Questionnaire and the Self-Report Questionnaire were used. there was no association between sociodemographic characteristics and mental disorder, but between aspects such as low income and schooling. The exercise of professions culturally considered as of low prestige gave rise to some reflections related to gender inequality. There was a significant difference in the satisfaction scores between the women who reported or not the symptoms of tiredness and sadness and the number of supporters among those who reported or not the symptom of fatigue. Spouses and children were the most mentioned supporters, and having mental disorder was significantly associated with having no friends in the support network. issues related to gender equity and satisfaction with social support are important aspects of care. For the promotion of mental health, efforts must be made to make women feel more connected and supported by the supporters available in their social environment.
