Prothrombotic states have been associated with viral infections and the novel Sars-COV-2 infection has been associated with elevated D-dimer levels, although no causal relation has been clearly established. This study presents an epidemiological analysis of manifest VTE episodes in a group of patients hospitalized because of COVID-19. Medical records of patients who presented symptomatic deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism in concomitance with confirmed COVID-19 were retrospectively studied. Demographic characteristics, prevalence of VTE, site of occurrence, D-dimer variation over time, management, and outcomes were analyzed. During the study period, 484 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were admitted, 64 of which displayed VTE symptoms and 13 of which had confirmed symptomatic VTE(2.68% of total sample and 20.31% of symptomatic cases). Most cases (76.92%) occurred in intensive care. On the day attributed to VTE onset, D-dimer levels were over 3,000 ng/mL in 8 (80%) patients, a significant increase from baseline admission levels (<i>p</i> < 0.05). A significant decrease was also observed in D-dimer values at hospital discharge (<i>p</i> < 0.05). All patients received pharmacological thromboprophylaxis and/or anticoagulation as indicated. Two deaths occurred during the study, both patients with severe comorbidities. At the end of our study protocol, nine patients had been discharged and two remained hospitalized, but had no signs of VTE worsening. VTE prevalence in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was 2.7%, and higher in intensive care units. Early institution of prophylaxis and immediate full anticoagulation when VTE is diagnosed should be the goals of those who treat this kind of patient.
