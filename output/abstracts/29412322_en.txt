The objective of the study was to assess the association between serum zinc level and cardiometabolic factors in prepubertal Brazilian children. This was a cross-sectional study in a representative sample of schoolchildren 8 to 9 years of age in public and private urban schools in Vi√ßosa, Minas Gerais State, Brazil. Body composition was assessed with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. The study measured serum glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, high and low density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoproteins A (Apo A) and B, uric acid, leptin, homocysteine, ultrasenstive C-reactive protein, and serum zinc. Arterial pressure was measured with automatic inflation equipment. Zinc deficiency was observed in 1.3% of the children. Girls showed the worst cardiometabolic profile, with higher prevalence of increased android fat, triglycerides, insulin resistance, leptin, zinc, and Apo A. In the first tertile of serum zinc concentration, prevalence of insulin resistance was 96% higher (PR = 1.96; 95%CI: 1.04-3.66) and hypercholesterolemia was 23% lower (PR = 0.77; 95%CI: 0.61-0.96) than in the reference category (grouped 2nd and 3rd tertiles of serum zinc concentration). Despite the low prevalence of zinc deficiency, insulin resistance was more prevalent in children in the lowest third of serum zinc concentration. It is important to prevent cardiometabolic alterations in childhood, especially insulin resistance, with an emphasis on serum zinc level.
