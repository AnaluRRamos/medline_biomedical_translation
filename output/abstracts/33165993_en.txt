Keratinocyte organoids can be used as a tool to evaluate epidermal structure, function and dysfunction. To optimize the canine keratinocyte organoid system and produce organoids that are structurally equivalent to in vivo canine epidermis, in order to enable studies that focus on epidermal diseases and diseases resulting from an impaired epidermal barrier. Skin biopsies were obtained from five recently euthanized dogs of different breeds with no skin abnormalities. Cells derived from microdissected interfollicular epidermis were seeded in basement membrane extract and epidermal organoids were grown under different media conditions. Organoids were characterized to assess cell morphology and architecture in haematoxylin and eosin-stained slides and expression of selected epidermal markers (keratin 5, keratin 10, loricrin and filaggrin) by immunohistochemical analysis and quantitative reverse transcription PCR. The selected epidermal markers were expressed in the same epidermal layers in the organoids cultured in expansion medium and differentiation medium as in normal interfollicular epidermis, yet restriction to the distinct layers was best achieved with expansion medium. Comparison of the mRNA expression levels of these markers revealed that relative expression is similar in organoids cultured in expansion medium and normal canine epidermis, while it differs in organoids cultured in differentiation medium. Organoids cultured in expansion medium have an equivalent structure to the interfollicular epidermis and express key marker proteins in similar proportions. Epidermal organoids are therefore a promising in vitro model to study epidermal structure, function and dysfunction.
