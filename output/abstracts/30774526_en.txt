Paget's disease of bone is a chronic condition characterized by focal abnormalities of absorption and formation of bone, and it may lead to anatomical deformities, pain, fractures, and malignant transformation. It is common in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, and North America and has a strong hereditary component, affecting first- to third-degree relatives. The etiology remains unclear and treatment is based on control of the disease with bisphosphonates, with the aim of relieving symptoms and correcting laboratory abnormalities. Surgical treatment may also be necessary to correct deformities or treat pathological fractures. This study evaluated the management and course of 8 patients with Paget's disease of bone, followed in the Orthopedic Clinic of this hospital. Among these patients, 1 had concomitant advanced prostate carcinoma, highlighting the association between Paget's disease and secondary bone diseases that can affect the differential diagnosis. <b><i>Level of evidence IV, Study type: Case Series.</i></b>
