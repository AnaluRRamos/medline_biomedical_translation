The aim of this study was to describe surgical features of resection of hemimelic epiphyseal dysplasia of the patella. We already described the clinical and imaging features in another article. The patient was a six-year-old boy with a tumor in his right knee measuring 12 cm longitudinally and 6 cm transversally, which was adhering to the patella and had been slowly growing for two years. Biopsy findings were suggestive of a benign osteochondromatous lesion, without a defined diagnosis. Imaging examinations such as radiography and tomography showed areas of bone formation and radiotransparent areas, while magnetic resonance imaging showed areas of hypo and hypersignal in T1 and T2, of estimated size 8.5 cm longitudinally and 6 cm transversally. The tumor growth was surgically resected and curettage was performed on the epiphyseal nucleus of ossification of the upper and medial centers of the patella, with good patellar remodeling and normal development. The patient did not present any recurrence of the lesion up to the time of reaching skeletal maturity.
