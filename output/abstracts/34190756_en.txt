Describe the vocal profile of 46,XX congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) patients followed up at the Genetics Outpatient Clinic of the Federal University Bahia (GOC-UFBA). This is a descriptive, exploratory, cross-sectional study. The study sample consisted of 28 volunteers: 14 individuals diagnosed with CAH, followed up by the multiprofessional team of the GOC-UFBA, and 14 46,XX individuals without vocal changes and endocrine and/or genetic pathologies. Voice sample collection was performed individually in a quiet environment with participants properly seated. Acoustic (PRAAT program) and auditory-perceptual (Consensus Auditory-Perceptual Evaluation of Voice - CAPE-V) analyses were conducted. In the qualitative assessment of pitch, eight (61.54%) patients in the CAH group showed low vocal pattern and eight (61.54%) individuals in the group without CAH presented high vocal pattern. There were statistically significant differences between the groups only for the following vocal attributes of the CAPE-V: overall severity (p=0.01), roughness (p=0.00), and pitch (p=0.01). No statistically significant difference was observed in the other acoustic parameters investigated (p>0.05). The present study demonstrated that 46,XX CAH individuals, even when submitted to hormone therapy, present rough, low, deviant voice.
