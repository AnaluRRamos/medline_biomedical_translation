Health care professionals are at high risk for work accidents; within this context, personal protective equipment (PPE) acts as a barrier and affords protection in any situation of potential exposure to biological materials. To analyze associated factors and determine the frequency of adherence to use of PPE by health care professionals from the state of Maranhão who suffered sharps injuries at work. A cross-sectional epidemiological and analytical study based on secondary data from the System of Information on Notifiable Diseases (Sistema de Informação de Agravos de Notificação - SINAN) was performed with health care professionals who suffered sharps injuries from 2010 to 2015. Unadjusted analysis was performed first and then hierarchical adjusted analysis with adherence to use of PPE as response variable. Only variables with p<0.05 were considered as having association with the response variable. The frequency of use of PPE was 41%. At the end of hierarchical analysis, non-adherence to use of PPE remained associated with having 12 or less years of formal schooling, working at the capital/metropolitan area, percutaneous exposure, exposure to blood, needlestick injuries and improper disposal of sharps. The frequency of adherence to PPE was relatively low among health care professionals from the state of Maranhão who were victims of accidents. Twelve years or less of formal schooling, not using PPE and improper disposal of sharps might contribute to the occurrence of work accidents at health care services.
