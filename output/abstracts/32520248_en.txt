This cross-sectional study sought to assess the effect of demographic and socioeconomic factors, chronic diseases, and health counseling on dietary patterns of the elderly. Food consumption was assessed by means of a reduced eating frequency questionnaire distributed to 1,426 elderly residents in Pelotas, State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, and dietary patterns were obtained using main component analysis. Two dietary patterns were identified: healthy diet (wholegrain food, fruits, vegetables, and milk) and Western diet (sweet snacks, fried foods, frozen foods, processed meats, and fast food). Females, non-smokers, and alcohol-free individuals tended more toward the healthy diet, whereas males, smokers, alcohol-dependent, and overweight individuals tended more toward the Western diet. Higher income and schooling were associated with a higher tendency toward both diets, and chronic diseases were not associated with either diet. Receiving counseling for adopting healthy habits was associated with a higher tendency toward a healthy diet and a lower tendency toward the Western diet. There is a need to increase effective guidance on healthy habits by health services to promote healthier eating practices, with special attention to elderly males, smokers, alcohol-dependent and overweight individuals.
