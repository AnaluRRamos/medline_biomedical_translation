To evaluate the content and psychometric properties of comprehensive nursing assessment tools developed based on The Eleven Functional Health Patterns Assessment Framework. An integrative literature review following Whittemore and Knafl's method and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Searches on PubMed, Cinahl, and Virtual Health Library were conducted between September and December 2018. Six out of 146 records were included for review. Four articles were methodological studies and two were descriptive reports of the development of the tools. Tools were heterogenous in terms of their purpose, development, characteristics, and testing. Only one study provided data about construct validity. However, there were commonalities regarding the data that should be assessed in each tool. Few comprehensive nursing assessment tools using The Eleven Functional Health Patterns Assessment Framework are available. Purpose, process of development, characteristics, and testing varied among the tools, and most lack robust psychometric testing. This review provided a synthesis of the literature regarding the use of a discipline-specific framework to guide comprehensive nursing assessment. The differences across the tools and the lack of psychometric testing compromise the visibility of nursing and make it difficult to emphasize the contribution of nursing knowledge to patient care.
