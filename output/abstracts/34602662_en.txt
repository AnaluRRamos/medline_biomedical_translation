To report the computed tomography (CT) features of acute cerebrovascular complications in severely ill patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the intensive care unit. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 29 intensive care unit patients with confirmed COVID-19 who underwent CT of the brain. We describe the CT features of the cerebrovascular complications of COVID-19, as well the demographic characteristics and clinical features, together with the results of laboratory tests, such as complete blood cell count, coagulation testing, renal function testing, and C-reactive protein assay. Two patients were excluded because of brain death. Among the remaining 27 patients, CT revealed acute cerebrovascular complications in six (three men and three women; 49-81 years of age), whereas no such complications were seen in 21 (15 men and six women; 36-82 years of age). Radiologists should be aware of the risks of cerebrovascular complications of COVID-19 and the potential underlying etiologies. COVID-19-associated coagulopathy is likely multifactorial and may increase the risk of ischemic and hemorrhagic infarction.
