Health status indicators are an important tool for monitoring the performance of public health actions, identifying trends and priority regions for resource allocation. An R package was developed in order to increase the feasibility of handling and analyzing health status indicator data. The rtabnetsp package requests data from TabNet servers on the São Paulo State Department of Health website, retrieving and preprocessing the data for user manipulation. This article presents the rtabnetsp package and its functions, installation and use; as well as providing examples of its functionalities, which involve listing and searching among available indicators, selecting desired content and obtaining data aggregated according to regionalization level held on the data matrix, enabling greater agility in tasks regarding public health management in the state of São Paulo.
