Mammary hibernomas are extremely rare benign tumors composed of brown fat cells, with only five cases previously reported in the literature. We report the case of a 42-year-old female patient with a painless growing mass in her right breast. A partial mastectomy was performed, and the diagnosis of hibernoma was confirmed by the histological features and the immunohistochemical profile. Although hibernoma is a benign tumor, its main differential diagnoses include aggressive lesions, making the accurate diagnosis essential to provide adequate care to the patient.
