To assess the repair results of acromioclavicular dislocations (ACJD) grades III and V, with anchors without eyelet, when compared with other techniques, and to evaluate factors that can affect the final result. A retrospective study of 36 patients with ACJD grades III and V in the Rockwood classification, 12 treated with anchors without eyelet, 11 with one tightrope, six with two tightropes, and six with subcoracoid cerclage, operated from September 2012 to February 2015. Patients were assessed radiographically and through DASH, UCLA, the visual analog scale of pain (VAS) and the Short-Form 36 (SF-36). Surgical time and the possible influence of some factors in the outcome were also assessed. The mean DASH score was 6.7; UCLA, 32.9; VAS, 1.2; and SF-36, 79.47. Radiographically, the final mean measurement was 9.93 mm, with no statistical difference between the groups. The mean surgical time for Group I was 31 min; Group II, 19 min; Group III, 29 min; and Group IV, 59 min. There was a significant difference between Groups II and IV when compared with the study group. The initial and immediate post-operative ACJD measurements ACJD were correlated with the final measure. The repair of acute ACJD with anchors without eyelet is as effective as the other methods, with significantly shorter operative time when compared with the subcoracoid cerclage technique. The final radiological result is influenced by the coracoclavicular initial distance and the immediate postoperative measurement.
