To identify the prevalence of suicidal ideation and its associated factors in university students from the health field, in a public higher education institution. Cross-sectional study with 142 university students. Suicide Ideation Scale and a questionnaire for characterization were used. Fischer's exact test, chi-square, Odds-Ratio, Kruskal-Wallis, and Spearman's correlation were performed. A significance level of 0.05 was adopted. The prevalence of suicidal ideation was 22%. It was associated to the use of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs, bullying, suicide attempts (p-value = 0.000), and not attending the course desired (p-value = 0.001). It was observed that the higher the score the lower the academic performance (p-value = 0.000). There was a difference in the mean score according to course (p-value = 0.000), and the score was higher among psychology students. The high prevalence of suicidal ideation among university students in the health field reiterates the need to create intervention strategies, especially in the context of universities.
