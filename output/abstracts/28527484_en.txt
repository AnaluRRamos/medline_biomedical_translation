Lithium has a narrow therapeutic window. Frequent monitoring of both serum levels and clinical signs of toxicity is warranted because toxicity may be present even when concentrations are within the therapeutic range. We report the case of a man with lithium poisoning, with persistent neurologic signs and symptoms even after removal of lithium from circulation - a diagnosis of syndrome of irreversible lithium-effectuated neurotoxicity (SILENT) was made.
