This article sets out to evaluate the prevalence and factors associated with adherence to enzyme replacement therapy among adolescents with cystic fibrosis. It is a cross-sectional, descriptive and observational study. Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected. The instruments used to assess adherence were: the Morisky-Green questionnaire and medication dispensation at the pharmacy, and interviews with structured questionnaires for the associated factors. Forty-four adolescents were interviewed. According to the method of the pharmacy medication dispensation analysis and the Morisky-Green questionnaire, the adherence of 45.5% and 11.4% was found, respectively. The higher adherence was observed in those with early diagnosis and the lowest in older adolescents and girls. The factors with the highest prevalence of non-adherence were: not taking enzymes when eating out of the home; only taking enzymes with major meals; normal lung function; with severe and very severe obstruction. The prevalence of adhesion to enzymes was low. Information related to the disease and treatment should be improved, especially among older adolescents and with impairment of lung function, with the creation of strategies and longitudinal studies to identify factors that interfere with adherence.
