To compare the reports of occupational events recorded by nursing professionals during the periods of reuse and single use of the dialyzer. Retrospective longitudinal study with electronic medical records from nursing technicians of a hemodialysis service. Data were analyzed descriptively and Rate ratio. During the reuse of the dialyzer, there were seven events from five professionals reporting musculoskeletal disorders, ocular allergies and dermatosis. During single use, two professionals reported low back pain. The rate ratio of medication use was 6.7 days for every 1000 professionals during the reuse period and 1.52 days in the single use period (RR=4.4; 95% CI 2.182-9.805). Anti-inflammatory drugs were the most prescribed, and sick leaves were similar in both periods. Dialyzer reuse was associated with musculoskeletal disorders, ocular irritation, dermatosis and increased use of medications by professionals. Sick leaves were similar on the periods of dialyzer reuse and single use.
