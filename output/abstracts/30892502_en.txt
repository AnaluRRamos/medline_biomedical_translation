The high prevalence of voice disorders among professionals who use their voice as a working tool, signals the existence of a collective illness caused by voice wear through poor working conditions and lack of social protection. This article describes the construction of a political movement seeking recognition of voice disorder as a work-related disease in Brazil. This is a narrative review on the historical processes, including social subjects, production of knowledge and the proposals for a strategic agenda, in view of the urgency of including voice disorder in the Brazilian Ministry of Health's list of work-related diseases. The analysis comprises three strands: a) technical and scientific, on advances in characterization of voice disorder and establishment of its connection with work; b) juridical and institutional, on legal recognition of this linkage; c) political and professional, on mobilization of social actors to advocate recognition of work-related voice disorders (WRVDs). The key role of the Pontifical Catholic University of SÃ£o Paulo in fomenting discussions about WRVDs over the course of this movement lasting nearly two decades is highlighted, along with the main difficulties in achieving formal recognition of WRVDs .
