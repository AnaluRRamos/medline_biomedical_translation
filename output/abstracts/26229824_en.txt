to conduct an observational study, by means of campaigns, regarding the use of child restraint devices in cars in Goiânia. this was a cross-sectional study using a convenience sample built up as cases arose. The data were gathered into an Excel spreadsheet and were analyzed descriptively and statistically (SPSS 16.0), using chi-square and taking p < 0.05 as significant. in 2006, 410 cars were evaluated, and in 2010, 544 cars were evaluated. Around 85% of the occupants were using seat belts correctly at both times (p = 0.650). In 2006, it was observed that a total of 273 passengers were occupying the rear seats, while in 2010 there were 226. Among these, 178 and 170 were using seat belts, respectively, i.e. 65.2% and 75.22% (p = 0.001). In 2006, five children were occupying the front seat without using the seat belt, while in 2010, this number was 42 (p < 0.001). In 2010, it was observed that 458 vehicles were transporting children on the rear seats, and this was being done correctly in 214 vehicles, i.e. 46.72%. In 2006, of the 410 vehicles analyzed, only 90 of them (21.95%) were transporting children correctly (p < 0.001). In addition, there was a difference in the variables within the year evaluated, in which transportation done correctly in the front seat was much more frequent than transportation done correctly in the rear seats, in both years (p < 0.001). Cars transported one to four children, while vans transported one to nine children. In 2006, one van transporting children irregularly was observed, while in 2010 it was done correctly in all cases. comparing these two years (2006 and 2010) in which data were gathered, we can conclude that changes in behavior among drivers in Goiânia have begun, with regard to safety when transporting children in vehicles, with an improvement of 25% (p < 0.001). A large part of this has come through changes in knowledge among this segment of the population, through campaigns that have been carried out, including through the media, and because of legal obligations.
