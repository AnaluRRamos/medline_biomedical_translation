Pectus excavatum is a deformity that affects aesthetics and causes emotional disorders. Surgical correction is well established, but conservative treatment is less common. We investigated the long-term results of using a brace and performing specific physical exercises to treat localized pectus excavatum, a type of deformity in which the depressed area is restricted to the midline region along the nipple line. We selected 115 patients (mean age 12.8 years), with a minimum follow-up of 36 months, who were evaluated more than one year after the end of treatment and skeletal maturity. Results were correlated with deformity flexibility, severity, regular use of the device, and performance of specific exercises. The chi-square (Ï‡<sup>2</sup>) and the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests were used for statistical analysis. Treatment was successful in 58% of patients, however, when exercises were performed and the brace was used regularly by patients with flexible deformities, the rate increased to 83% (p = 0.005). Severity and adherence to treatment greatly impacted successful treatment (p = 0.009 and < 0.001, respectively). The proposed treatment method was effective for correction or partial correction of the deformity in motivated patients followed up until skeletal maturity, especially when started early in milder and more flexible deformities. <b>Level of Evidence V, Expert opinion.</b>
