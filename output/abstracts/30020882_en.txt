Patients with haematological malignancies have a higher incidence of infection compared with the general population. Several factors contribute to this but specially chemotherapy drugs carry different and specific infectious risks. This protocol discusses the prevention of infections in patients who will undergo chemotherapy for the treatment of haematological malignancies. It is divided into: study prior to the initiation of chemotherapy; vaccination and eradication prior to initiation of chemotherapy; antimicrobial prophylaxis during chemotherapy; special situations. The main aims of this protocol are to serve as support to a more systematic and individualized approach to patients undergoing chemotherapy for the treatment of haematological malignancies and by doing so prevent the infectious complications that may arise.
