This study aimed to evaluate the influence of bareback sexually explicit media (SEM) consumption on anal sex without a condom by men who have sex with men (MSM). To this end, a page was created on the FacebookÂ® social network with a link that directed interested parties to a questionnaire. Cisgender men, aged 18 years and over, who had sex with other men in the last 12 months, were included. Data were collected in 2017 and analyzed using univariate and bivariate inferential statistics and multivariate logistic regression. A total of 2,248 MSM participated in the research, with a mean age of 24.4 years and a mean number of 3.9 partners in the last 30 days. Having multiple sexual partners (ORa: 9.4; 95% CI 3.9-22.4), preferring movies with bareback scenes (ORa: 2.6; 95% CI 1.5-4.6), considering this practice a fetish and realizing it (ORa: 3.52; 95% CI 2.3-5.4), having casual partnerships (ORa: 1.8; 95% CI 1.5-1.9) and being aware of the partner's negative serological status for HIV (ORa: 1.4; 95% CI 1.1-2.3) were factors that increased the likelihood of engaging in anal sex without a condom. Thus, we found an association between the consumption of bareback SEM and sex without a condom among MSM.
