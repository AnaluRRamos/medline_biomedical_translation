Chagas disease (CD) is caused by <i>Trypanosoma Cruzi</i>. This parasite can infect several organs of the human body, mainly the heart, causing inflammation, fibrosis, arrhythmias, and cardiac remodeling, promoting long-term Chronic Chagas Cardiomyopathy (CCC). However, little scientific evidence has elucidated the molecular mechanisms that govern the pathophysiological processes in this disease. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are regulators of post-transcriptional gene expression that modulate signaling pathways, participating in pathophysiological mechanisms in CD, but the understanding of miRNAs in this disease is limited. On the other hand, a wide range of scientific evidence shows that physical exercise training (PET) modulates the expression of miRNAs by modifying different signaling pathways in healthy individuals. Some studies also show that PET is beneficial for individuals with CD; however, these did not evaluate the miRNA expressions. Thus, there is no evidence showing the role of PET in the expression of miRNAs in CD. Therefore, this review aimed to identify miRNAs expressed in CD that could potentially be modified by PET.
