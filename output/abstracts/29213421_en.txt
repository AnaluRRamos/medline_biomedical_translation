This is a study on burden of caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's disease attended at a Reference Center for Cognitive Disorders. To evaluate the profile and burden on caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's disease attended at a Reference Center for Cognitive Disorders. We collected demographic information and data on the relationship with the patient from caregivers, and measured burden with the Zarit scale. The patients were evaluated with the following scales: the Cambridge Cognitive Test (CAMCOG); Mini Mental State Examination, the Neuropsychiatric Inventory for neuropsychiatry symptoms, and Functional Activities Questionnaire - FAQ for functional impairment. Of the 31 caregivers, 77.4% were female, predominantly, and daughters, having a mean age of 58.6 years, educational level of 8.1 years, 70% of caregivers co-resided with the patient and 71% did not work. The mean time as a caregiver was 3 years. Twenty-seven percent of the caregivers presented mild to severe burden. The variables presenting significant association with caregiver burden were scores on the NPI and CAMCOG. The social demographic characteristics of the sample were similar to those of studies performed in other countries. The average time as a caregiver and the frequency of caregivers with mild to intense burden were lower than those reported in international studies. Neuropsychiatric symptoms and severity of cognitive decline were the main factors associated to burden in this sample of mostly mild to moderate demented AD patients. Further studies are necessary to verify whether the burden is indeed less intense in our milieu.
