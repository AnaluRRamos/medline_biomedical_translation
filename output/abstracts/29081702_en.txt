The aim of this study was to translate, culturally adapt, and validate the 'Foot Function Index - Revised' (FFI-R) for use in Brazilian Portuguese. The scale was translated and administered (as recommended by Guillemin, 2000) to 52 patients in the postoperative period after foot and ankle surgery. Seven days after the initial assessment, the scale was readministered by a different interviewer. The data were entered into an Excel spreadsheet and analyzed using SPSS version 23.0 software for Mac. Reproducibility was assessed using intraclass correlation analysis. were considered statistically significant at a type I error rate of 5%. Results: The following random-effects intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were obtained for each score on the FFI-R: 0.625 for pain, 0.558 for stiffness, 0.757 for difficulty, 0.718 for activity restrictions, 0.854 for personal concerns, and 0.753 for the total score. The FFI-R was successfully translated to Portuguese and culturally adapted for use in Brazilian patients, demonstrating satisfactory validity and reliability. <b>Level of Evidence I, Testing of Previously Developed Diagnostic Criteria on Consecutive Patients (with universally applied reference 'golg' standard).</b>
