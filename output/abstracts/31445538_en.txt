Until recently, the main goal of chronic myeloid leukemia therapy was disease control with the best overall survival, which required lifelong treatment. However, currently, the treatment-free remission concept is becoming an important goal in clinical practice, and several tyrosine kinase inhibitors discontinuation studies have shown that round 50% of patients with a durable deep molecular response beyond major molecular response successfully interrupt tyrosine kinase inhibitors for at least three years without loss of molecular response. However, and regardless of the existing evidence, the exact conditions for attempting treatment-free remission remain poorly defined. Different authors tried to guide the clinical decision regarding this topic but there are some points that differ, namely with respect to the recommended duration of tyrosine kinase inhibitors therapy and the appropriate molecular response prior to treatment-free remission. The goal of this article is to propose an algorithm to guide clinical practice in Portugal concerning chronic phase-chronic myeloid leukemia patients who wish to attempt treatment-free remission, since there are no national guidelines.
