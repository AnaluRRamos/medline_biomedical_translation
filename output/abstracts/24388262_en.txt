Capsular contracture is a chronic and the most frequent complication of augmentation mammoplasty with breast implants and the main cause of patient's and surgeon's dissatisfaction. The mammary capsule consists of a fibrous tissue that surrounds the implant that may contract, changing the shape and consistency of the breast. In its advanced stage is accompanied by pronounced deformity, hardness and pain, being indicated for surgical treatment. All the articles indexed on PubMed through the search 'capsular contracture' (2000 - January 2012) were reviewed and were included the articles of greater interest in terms of etiology, prophylaxis and treatment. Articles referred in relevant publications were also examined. Everything indicates that its etiology is multifactorial; the etiopathology of breast capsular contracture continues being subject of multiple pre-clinical investigations. There are many studies performed in order to prevent the onset of capsular contracture but, although promising results, little is set for its application on clinical practice. The capsulectomy/capsulotomy continues being the gold standard treatment although the future may undergo non invasive techniques, at least in mild stages of disease. Although the surgical techniques and the quality of breast implants have been improving drastically in recent years, capsular contracture remains a real complication with great incidence and that continues affecting thousands of women all over the world.
