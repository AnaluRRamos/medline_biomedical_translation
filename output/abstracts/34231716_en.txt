Barriers faced by health services providing scheduled care result in high no-show rates. This article describes the main characteristics of an online appointment scheduling system incorporated into the citizens' electronic health record system (PEC e-SUS APS). Developed by the Bridge Laboratory, Federal University of Santa Catarina, which also developed the PEC e-SUS APS, the system allows patients to schedule appointments using the national patient communications hub, Conecte SUS Cidad√£o. The PEC e-SUS APS includes a professional's agenda module that allows patients to view available time slots and book and cancel appointments. Unfortunately, despite the benefits of online scheduling systems, their potential has been poorly exploited in Brazil. The main reasons for this include lack of information and training of health professionals on how to use the system and its potential benefits for Primary Health Care (PHC) services. Wider dissemination is needed to improve the adoption of the system and promote the routine use of this tool in health services in order to facilitate access to primary health care.
