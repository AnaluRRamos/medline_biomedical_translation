This essay aims to suggest food for thought on discrepancies between scientific evidence on physical inactivity and the associated factors and determinants and information communicated by the media on this topic. We specifically examine a case in which 'laziness' was used as the 'explanatory' factor for the high levels of physical inactivity in the Brazilian population. We use as examples a scientific article published in Nature and two news stories published in mainstream Brazilian media channels (Veja magazine and O Globo newspaper) that commented on the former. There were important inconsistencies between the scientific content in the Nature article and the news stories, which took a simplistic approach to a real and complex problem (high levels of physical inactivity in Brazil), suggesting that 'laziness' explains why Brazil ranks so poorly in the world in terms of physical activity. We highlight the need for mass communications media to better contextualize the information they republish, because otherwise the impact can be more negative than positive, especially when they build or reinforce misconceptions. This is particularly serious in the case of physical inactivity, since such news coverage can lend legitimacy to the lack of investments in measures to deal adequately with the problem. If physical inactivity is interpreted merely as a matter of 'laziness', it makes much less sense to invest in modifying various determinants of this serious public health problem.
