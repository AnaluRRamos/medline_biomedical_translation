Investigate the factors associated with the glycemic control in people with diabetes mellitus (DM). Cross-sectional study with 746 people with type-2 DM of age 40 or older. The following variables were selected: socioeconomic, clinical data, lifestyle and the risk of developing foot ulcers. Data collection occurred through interviews, medical record analysis and clinical examination of the lower limbs. We used the Poisson multiple regression model to determine the crude and adjusted prevalence ratios (PR) of the glycemic alteration. The alteration in the glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) test was considered as a dependent variable in this study, which has been classified as high when the result was higher than 7%. The alteration in HbA1c was present in 68.9% of the participants and was more prevalent in individuals aged between 50 and 69 (PR = 1.38/IC95% = 1.09-1.75), who were taking insulin (PR = 1.35/IC95% = 1.24-1.47), obese (PR = 1.14/IC95% = 1.03-1.25) and who had foot ulceration risk (PR = 1.14/IC95% = 1.09-1.28). Individuals aged between 50 and 69; the ones who used insulin; the obese ones; and those who had a risk of foot ulceration, presented higher prevalence rates of alteration in the glycated hemoglobin.
