Compare the results in naming tasks of after-stroke aphasic individuals divided into active and placebo groups pre- and post-transcranial direct current stimulation. A double-blind, randomized, controlled study conducted with 14 individuals. Patients underwent five 20-min sessions with stimulation of 2mA's on consecutive days. The cathode was placed over the Broca's homologous area and the anode was placed over the supraorbital region of the left hemisphere. Boston and Snodgrass naming tasks were assessed before and after the stimulation sessions and the results were compared between the groups. No significant results were observed for sequences 1 and 2 in the Snodgrass test. The Boston test results indicated significant difference related to mean time for correct responses with strategy. The results suggest that simultaneous transcranial direct current stimulation (anodic and cathodic) is a method that can improve the rehabilitation of patients with anomic and Broca's aphasia after stroke, and that language strategies should be considered in the analysis of naming task responses.
