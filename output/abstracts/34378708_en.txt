This study aimed to characterize the food environment within subway stations in São Paulo and describe the availability of food and drinks according to the social vulnerability of the area where the stations are located. A cross-sectional study was carried out involving 19 subway stations, and checklist instruments were used to audit outlets and vending machines. The São Paulo Social Vulnerability Index was adopted to characterize the location of the stations. Sixty-six outlets were found. The median of outlets per station was the same in all categories of the territory's social vulnerability (median=2 establishments/station). The most frequent types of food sold were convenience foods, present in all of the outlets. The territory's vulnerability did not result in a difference in the availability of healthy and unhealthy marker foods. The food environment at subway stations is marked by the high availability of ultra-processed food and drinks at all outlets.
