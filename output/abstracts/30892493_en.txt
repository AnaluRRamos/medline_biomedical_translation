The present study highlighted the labour process of the dental surgeon (DS) in the private healthcare sector from the healthcare professional's perspective based on intervention bioethics. An observational, cross-sectional survey study was performed within the Federal District (Distrito Federal) region. Data were collected from 108 questionnaires completed by DSs affiliated with two types of private health insurers, self-insurance and group insurance, to assess job perception and the degree of job satisfaction in the dentistry market. The main source of dissatisfaction for healthcare professionals was related to the pay for dental procedures by insurers. For self-insurer 1, 38.1% healthcare professionals replied that the pay was satisfactory, whereas in self-insurance 2 and in the group insurance, 100% of healthcare professionals were dissatisfied. Another finding was that the group insurer considerably restricted elective treatments. In conclusion, loss of professional autonomy, depreciation of insurance claims and precarisation of dentistry occurs in the private healthcare sector, thus demonstrating the ethical conflicts in this relationship.
