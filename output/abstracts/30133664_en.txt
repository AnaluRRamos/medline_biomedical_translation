Obesity is considered a serious public health problem, as an epidemic disease with major global repercussions that is associated with the development of other chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. The current study examines the distribution of adult obesity in different countries using a beta regression model. This is a descriptive ecological study with a quantitative and inferential approach and a focus on beta regression analysis. Application of this method used a set of real data from public sources on adult obesity in 78 countries in 2014. Descriptive data analysis showed that 50% of the countries showed adult obesity prevalence greater than 20%. In addition, analysis of the distribution of prevalence by country showed lower adult obesity levels in countries of Asia and Africa. Meanwhile, higher values were found in countries of the Americas and Europe. Boxplot analysis also evidenced a possible difference in the proportion of obese adults between the Americas and Europe on one side and Africa and Asia on the other. Adjustment of the beta regression model with varying dispersion and 5% significance identified mean annual per capita alcohol intake, percentage of insufficient physical activity, percentage of the population living in urban areas, and life expectancy as variables associated with adult obesity.
