This paper presents, in the context of the universal health strategy, some general considerations and economic actions on financing, efficiency and other economic challenges of public health in Cuba. Official bibliographic sources of the Cuban state were revised up to 2015. The analyses of time series were adjusted to constant prices of 1997 and the official exchange rate of 1 Cuban peso = 1 US dollar. The Cuban National Health System has a solid infrastructure, consisting of a wide network of health facilities that guarantee full coverage, access and equity in the services provided to the population through qualified human resources. An economic analysis was carried out under the conceptual framework of the universal health strategy, with an emphasis in financing, efficiency and challenges of the Cuban public health system to maintain the right to health of its citizens, equity, coverage and access to the services provided, including the elimination of economic, sociocultural and gender barriers, as well as solidarity with the Cuban population and the world. It was concluded that in Cuba, universal health is considered one of its most valuable achievements, although it is needed a most efficient analysis of reliable and available sources, research and application of results to practice on the strengths and weaknesses of the system regarding health economics, updating and a better use of resources and technologies, as well as deepening the lessons learned and facing remaining challenges.
