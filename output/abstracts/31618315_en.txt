To analyze drug content in games for mobile devices. An exploratory study implementing a qualitative approach. The collective health critical perspective was taken in relation to the ideology of prohibitionist education and the foundations of emancipatory education in the area of drugs. Games about drugs were selected in a virtual store based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Content analysis was performed with the support of an interpretative model specific to digital games used to identify textual and procedural messages in games. Nineteen (19) games were analyzed. Most of them reiterate prohibitionist positions and play the role of transmitting prescriptive and normative information, assuming the objective of disciplining risk behaviors. This evident limitation demonstrates an important contradiction that games are strategies of contemporary language, with outdated and unscientific content. Despite the potential of virtual tools, the analyzed games are marked by intense simplification regarding the phenomenon of drug use and stimulate fast preprogrammed responses that do not go beyond memorization and conditioning. A need for scientific updates and incorporation of critical educational content persists in the area.
