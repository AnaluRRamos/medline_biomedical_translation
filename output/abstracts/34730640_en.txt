The National School Food Program guarantees the food of students in public and philanthropic schools by means of the transfer of funds. During adolescence, which is an important period of nutritional vulnerability, a healthy diet is responsible for the rates of physical growth and changes in body composition. The objective was to analyze the adequacy of macro- and micronutrients provided to adolescents in full-time public schools in northeastern Brazil. The menus were evaluated using the parameters to meet 70% of the daily nutritional needs in terms of macronutrients and micronutrients of the students involved. It was found that, for most age groups, energy requirements were not met, attaining the maximum adequacy of 86.2%, and protein ingestion was only sufficient on four days. The average amount of carbohydrates and lipids was below the recommended dose for all age groups. The levels of Vitamin C, zinc and calcium were insufficient in most of the meals on offer, though the iron quota was adequate for all age groups. The conclusion drawn is that enhanced planning needs to be incorporated in the preparation of menus to attempt to attain the requirements stipulated in the Program.
