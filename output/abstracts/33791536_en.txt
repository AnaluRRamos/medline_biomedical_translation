There are many benefits to engaging students in authentic research experiences instead of traditional style lectures and 'cookbook' labs. Many Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) have been developed that provide research experiences to a more inclusive and diverse student body, allow more students to obtain research experiences, and expose students to the scientific process. Most CUREs in the biological sciences focus on cellular and molecular biology, with few being developed in ecology, evolution, and organismal biology. Here, I present a one-semester CURE focused on organismal form and function. The goal of the course was to have students develop their own research questions and hypotheses in relation to invertebrate form and movement, using high-speed cinematography to collect their data. In this paper, I describe the motivation for the course, provide the details of teaching the course, including rubrics for several assignments, the outcomes of the course, caveats, and ways a similar course can be implemented at other institutions. The course was structured to use a scaffolding approach during the first half of the semester to provide the content of form-function relationships and allow students to acquire the laboratory skills to quantify animal movement. The second half of the course focused on student-driven inquiry, with class time dedicated to conducting research. As there is a push to engage more students in research, I hope this course will inspire others to implement similar classes at other universities, providing a network of collaboration on integrative organismal student-driven research.
