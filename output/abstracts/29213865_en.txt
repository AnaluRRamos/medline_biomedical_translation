In most studies, body mass index (BMI) has been used as the main measurement of nutritional status. However, BMI does not differentiate between body fat and muscle mass. To investigate the association between nutritional status and cognitive impairment in a population of Brazilian elderly. Participants (n=1,496) from the Bambu√≠ Cohort Study of Aging were selected based on the results for the two variables nutritional status and cognitive impairment (MMSE score). Gender, age, education, lifestyle, ApoE, chronic diseases, depressive symptoms, current use of hypnotic or sedative medication and functional disability were used as confounding factors for adjusting the logistic regression. Cognitive impairment was associated with lower BMI (OR: 0.91; CI: 0.86-0.95), waist circumference (OR: 0.97; CI: 0.95-0.99), triceps skinfold thickness (OR: 0.92; CI: 0.89-0.96) among the younger participants (60-69 years), while lower arm muscle circumference (OR: 0.88; CI: 0.80-0.98) and corrected arm muscle area (OR: 0.96; CI: 0.93-0.99) were associated with cognitive impairment among the older participants (70 years and over). There was a difference of association between anthropometric measures and cognitive impairment after stratifying by age group. In the group aged between 60 and 69, cognitive impairment was associated with measures related to fat mass, while in the group aged over 70, cognitive impairment was associated with measures related to muscle mass. This finding suggests that investigation of nutritional status in the elderly using anthropometric measures should not be restricted only to the use of BMI, and should also, differ according to age.
