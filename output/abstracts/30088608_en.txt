To analyze the bond in social support delivery by a multidisciplinary team to families during the hospital stay of children/adolescents with chronic disease. Qualitative research, conducted in the pediatric unit of a public hospital in Para√≠ba State, Brazil, from November 2012 to July 2013, involving fourteen health professionals, by means of a semi-structured interview. The data were subjected to thematic analysis. The bond between the team and the family is promoted by dialogue and listening, which are recognized sources of social support. The encountered difficulties that interfered with the delivery of social support were weakness in team-family communication and interaction, gaps in the organization of the work process and lack of hospital infrastructure. Possible approaches to overcome these obstacles were follow-up beyond hospital discharge and a stronger team-family bond. Satisfying social support has an influence on coping with chronic disease in children and adolescents, and its proper delivery relies upon bonding and embracement.
