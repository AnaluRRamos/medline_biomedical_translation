To describe the implementation of a rapid response team in a large nonprofit hospital, indicating relevant issues for other initiatives in similar contexts, particularly in Latin America. In general terms, the intervention consisted of three major components: (1) a tool to detect aggravation of clinical conditions in general wards; (2) the structuring of a rapid response team to attend to all patients at risk; and (3) the monitoring of indicators regarding the intervention. This work employed four half-year Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles to test and adjust the intervention from January 2013 to December 2014. Between 2013 and 2014, the rapid response team attended to 2,296 patients. This study showed a nonsignificant reduction in mortality from 8.3% in cycle 1 to 5.0% in cycle 4; however, death rates remained stable in cycles 3 and 4, with frequencies of 5.2% and 5.0%, respectively. Regarding patient flow and continuum of critical care, which is a premise of the rapid response system, there was a reduction in waiting time for intensive care unit beds with a decrease from 45.9% to 19.0% in the frequency of inpatients who could not be admitted immediately after indication (p < 0.001), representing improved patient flow in the hospital. In addition, an increase in the recognition of palliative care patients from 2.8% to 10.3% was noted (p = 0.005). Implementing a rapid response team in contexts where there are structural restrictions, such as lack of intensive care unit beds, may be very beneficial, but a strategy of adjustment is needed.
