to detect the risk of development of type 2 diabetes in nurses and its relationship with metabolic alterations. cross-sectional study, with 155 nurses. The variables investigated were: sociodemographic, body mass index, waist circumference, waist-hip index, lipid profile, basal glycemia and oral glucose tolerance curve. The Finnish Diabetes Risk Score was used to collect data. 155 nurses were included, with an average age of 44 years and 85% were overweight or obese. 52% had a family history of diabetes and 21% had occasional hyperglycemia. With respect to the risk, 59% were identified with moderate and very high risk for type 2 diabetes. Glucose, insulin, glycosylated hemoglobin A1c and insulin resistance increased in parallel to the increased risk for type 2 diabetes, although lipids did not increase. 27% of the sample had impaired fasting glycemia. 15% had glucose intolerance and 5% had type 2 diabetes. there was a high detection rate of people at risk for type 2 diabetes (59%) and the high and very high risk score was associated with high levels of glycosylated hemoglobin A1c, glucose, insulin and insulin resistance, but not with lipids.
