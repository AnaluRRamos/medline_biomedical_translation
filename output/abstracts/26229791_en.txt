to evaluate the results from surgery with computer-assisted navigation in cases of total knee arthroplasty. a total of 196 patients who underwent total knee arthroplasty with computer-assisted navigation were evaluated. The extension and flexion spaces (gaps) were evaluated during the operation and the alignment after the operation was assessed. The Knee Society Score (KSS) questionnaire for assessing patient's function was applied preoperatively and postoperatively after a mean follow-up of 22 months. in all, 86.7% of the patients presented good alignment of the mechanical axis (less than 3Â° of varus or valgus in relation to the mechanical axis) and 96.4% of the patients presented balanced flexion and extension gaps. Before the operation, 97% of the patients presented poor or insufficient KSS, but after the operation, 77.6% presented good or excellent KSS. the navigation system made it possible to achieve aligned and balanced implants, with notable functional improvement among the patients. It was found to be useful in assessing, understanding and improving knowledge in relation to performing arthroplasty procedures.
