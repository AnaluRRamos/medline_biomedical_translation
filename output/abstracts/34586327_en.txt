To verify the benefit obtained by the prescription of acoustic gain based on the auditory thresholds obtained with pure tones modulated in frequency and with Narrow Band Noise. The sample consisted of 30 elderly people, aged 60 years or over with moderate to severe descending sensorineural symmetrical hearing loss with thresholds at 4kHz equal to or less than 70dBHL. There were two groups. GTP (pure tone group): 15 elderly people had their hearing aids fitted through the auditory thresholds obtained with pure tone and the GNB group (narrow band group): 15 elderly people had their hearing aids fitted through the auditory thresholds obtained with NB. The procedures performed before the fitting of hearing aids and after three months of amplification use were: COSI, WRS (Word Recognition Score), Signal/Noise ratio. The International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids (IOI-HA) was applied only after three months of hearing aid fitting. The elderly people in the group in which the hearing aids were fitted with a prescribed gain based on the hearing thresholds obtained with the Narrow Band stimulus showed better performance in the following tests: WRS on the right ear, total score of the IOI-HA inventory, COSI and longer use of hearing aids compared to the GTP group. There was a greater benefit with the use of hearing aids, due to the total score of the IOI-HA inventory, COSI scale and longer daily use time of hearing aids, in the group whose prescription of acoustic gain was based on the auditory thresholds obtained with narrow band.
