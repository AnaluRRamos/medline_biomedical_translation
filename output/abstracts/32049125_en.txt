Abortion complications are a major public health problem, and studies to assess the quality of abortion care require adequate measurement tools. This study is a continuation of such an instrument's refinement, the QualiAborto-Pt questionnaire. Using data from a survey of 2,336 women hospitalized for abortion complications in 19 hospitals in three state capitals in Northeast Brazil (Salvador - Bahia, Recife - Pernambuco, and São Luís - Maranhão), we implemented a series of exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses based on a 55-item prototype. The analyses indicate a structure with 17 items in five dimensions: reception, orientation, inputs/physical environment, technical quality, and continuity of care. All the items in the final model displayed acceptable reliability, absence of content redundancy, and factor specificity, as well as theoretical consistency with the respective dimensions. The solution also shows discriminant factor validity. Despite some persistent issues for further analysis and clarification, this version merits recommendation for use in Brazil.
