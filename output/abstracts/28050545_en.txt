Valve failure with reflux and post-thrombotic syndrome are the factors most commonly correlated with varicose disease. Other rare etiologies can be put forward when these two main causes are ruled out. We report a case in which a young man presented chronic pain in the left tibia, varicose veins in the lower limbs and frequent occurrences of erysipelas. During investigation of the etiology of the varicose veins, radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging of the left leg were requested. These showed images suggestive of an osteolytic lesion in the tibia, but led us to the diagnosis of an intraosseous vein with anomalous drainage. This was confirmed through vascular examinations comprising Doppler venous flow measurement and phlebography. Recognition of this rare intraosseous anomaly is fundamental for proper patient management, but an intraosseous surgical approach is unnecessary.
