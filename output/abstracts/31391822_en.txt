The accelerated emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance observed in recent decades is associated with the abuse and/or misuse of antimicrobial drugs. In 2014, Argentinaâ€™s Ministry of Health, in conjunction with other agencies and institutions, rolled out a national antimicrobial resistance control strategy designed to slow or prevent the emergence and spread of resistant bacteria. This article describes the action proposed and results obtained during the first implementation period in terms of improving human health surveillance, creating an animal health surveillance network, planning antimicrobial drugs consumption surveillance, monitoring restrictions on sales, adapting dosage forms to treatment needs, updating the antimicrobial drugs registry and diagnostic methods, restricting the use of these drugs as growth promoters, encouraging responsible use, preparing diagnostic and treatment guidelines, creating antimicrobial drugs management programs, and strengthening infection prevention and control programs in health facilities and livestock production.Many of these measures, particularly those related to antimicrobial drugs regulation, control, and management, can be implemented immediately, reducing the unnecessary use of these products, and with it, the impact on antimicrobial resistance.
