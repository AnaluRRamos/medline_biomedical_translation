To evaluate the nutritional profile of the population assisted at a reference center for cystic fibrosis treatment. Cross-sectional study including patients with cystic fibrosis assisted at a pediatric reference center in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, in 2014. All patients attending regular visits who agreed to participate in the study were included. A questionnaire on dietary habits (24-hour diet recall) and socioeconomic characteristics was applied. Anthropometric data (compared with the reference from the World Health Organization, 2006 and 2007) and pulmonary function data were collected from medical records. Patients were stratified into age groups for statistical analysis. A total of 101 patients were included in the study (59.4% male, 86.4% Caucasian), with median age of 10 years old. Most patients (n=77; 75%) were classified as eutrophic, but lower values of body mass index (BMI) Z scores were observed in schoolchildren and adolescents. The proportion of underweight patients was 10% (n=2) among preschoolers and 35% (n=6) of the school age group. Dietary intake was adequate, and the use of only two supplements (medium chain triglycerides and complete powdered supplement) was associated with adequacy of macronutrient intake. The socioeconomic characteristics did not show any statistical association with the nutritional state or nutritional consumption. Lung function was not significantly different between neither adolescents nor individuals with worse nutritional status in this sample. Most of the patients presented adequate nutritional status and adequate consumption of calories and macronutrients, indicating appropriate nutritional management. New studies focusing on preschool children should be performed to assess if it is possible to reduce the nutritional risk of patients with cystic fibrosis at older ages.
