to evaluate the association of food consumption with nutritional status, physical activity and sociodemographic factors in the bariatric surgery period preoperative. we conducted a cross-sectional study from 2018 to 2019, with patients admitted for bariatric surgery at the Oswaldo Cruz University Hospital, Federal University of Pernambuco. We collected data sociodemographic and nutritional data such as body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, highest weight and pre-surgical weight. We evaluated food consumption with the food frequency questionnaire based on the food pyramid adapted for bariatric patients and physical activity. the study involved 60 patients, 78.3% were female, mean age was 38.8±9.6 years, 53.3% were married, and 70% had more than 12 years of education. As for physical activity, 31.7% were sedentary. Regarding nutritional status, the mean BMI was 47.3±6.96kg/m2. Preoperative weight, highest weight reached before surgery and waist circumference were higher in males (p<0.05). There was an association between physical activity and food intake, and sedentary individuals consumed more carbohydrates (p=0.041). On the other hand, sociodemographic data and nutritional status were not associated with food consumption. the level of physical activity showed significant association only with carbohydrate consumption.
