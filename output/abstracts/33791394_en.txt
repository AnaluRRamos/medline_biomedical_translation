Persons with haemophilia (PWH) used to represent a population with a high prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection due to the use of contaminated blood products. Although the goals of antiviral therapy are the same as the general population, long real-life follow-up data regarding their outcomes are still scarce. Our aim was to report the outcomes of HCV infection and the results of antiviral therapy in PWH. A retrospective analysis was performed in a single-centre cohort of PWH with positive HCV antibody. Outcomes registered were rate of spontaneous clearance of HCV, sustained virologic response (SVR) achievement, development of end-stage liver disease, and all-cause and liver-related mortality. Out of 131 PWH, 73 (55.7%) had positive HCV antibody. During a median follow-up time of 22 years, 46 patients (63.9%) developed chronic hepatitis C, of which 16 (34.8%) developed cirrhosis. Treatment was pursued in 34 PWH. Most (<i>n</i> = 32) were first treated with interferon (IFN)-based regimens with SVR rates of 40.6%. Direct-acting antivirals were used in 14 IFN-experienced and 2 na√Øve patients, with an overall SVR rate of 100%. Overall, 17 patients (23.3%) died during the follow-up, only 4 related to liver disease. Of these, none had achieved SVR. We describe the outcomes of a cohort of Portuguese PWH and hepatitis C exposure after two decades of follow-up, with a lower mortality than previously described. Our response rates to HCV treatment were comparable to those in the general population and stress the importance of early treatment.
