Coronary no-reflow phenomenon (CNP) is associated with an increased risk of major cardiovascular adverse events (MACE). This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between serum Kidney Injury Molecule-1 (KIM-1) levels and CNP in patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). This study included a total of 160 patients (113 males and 47 females; mean age: 61.65±12.14 years) who were diagnosed with STEMI. The patients were divided into two groups, the reflow group (RG) (n=140) and the no-reflow group (NRG) (n=20). Patients were followed during one year. A p-value of <0.05 was considered significant. CNP was observed in 12.50% of the patients. Serum KIM-1 was significantly higher in the NRG than in the RG (20.26±7,32 vs. 13.45±6.40, p<0.001). Body mass index (BMI) was significantly higher in the NRG than in the RG (29.41 (28.48-31.23) vs. 27.56 (25.44-31.03), p=0.047). Heart rate (HR) was significantly lower in the NRG than in the RG (61.6±8.04 vs. 80.37±14.61, p<0.001). The European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation II (EuroSCORE II) was significantly higher in the NRG than in the RG (3.06±2.22 vs. 2.36±2.85, p=0.016). The incidence of stroke was significantly higher in the NRG than in the RG (15% vs. 2.90%, p=0.013). The baseline KIM-1 level (OR=1.19, 95% CI:1.07 to 1.34, p=0.002) and HR (OR=0.784, 95% CI:0.69 to 0.88, p<0.001) were the independent predictors of CNP. In conclusion, baseline serum KIM-1 concentrations and lower HR are independently associated with CNP in STEMI patients and the incidence of stroke was significantly higher in the NRG in the one-year follow-up.
