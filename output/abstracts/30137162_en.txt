To identify and characterize the risk factors of pressure ulcers (PU) in patients admitted in a Portuguese Hospital. Descriptive and cross-sectional study with a sample consisting of 34 individuals, 70.6 % male and 29.4 % female with a mean age of 78.93 ± 6.05 years. The data collection instrument consisted of an analysis grid that contains socio-demographic, clinical and therapeutic data. Descriptive statistics, and inferential analysis were estimated, the chi-square test of Pearson was used for p≤0.05. Data analysis found that individuals already presented with PU upon admission to the hospital, and that most of them stay between 6 days and 1 month; the longer the hospitalization period, the longer the hospitalization time, the greater the number of PU developed by individuals. Most PU patients have a strong prevalence of severe PU in the sacrum and calcaneus region, and hypertension, respiratory disease and Diabetes mellitus are the most frequent pathologies. The current gloomy picture of PUs can only be changed if there is greater investment in prevention and accurate treatment. In this sense, guidelines should be systematized for families during hospitalization and outpatient monitoring.
