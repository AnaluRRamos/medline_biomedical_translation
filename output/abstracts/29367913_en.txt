This study is aimed at evaluating the fixation of trabecular metal wedges in patients who underwent revision of total hip arthroplasty with large acetabular bone defects. The radiographs of 19 patients (21 hips), who underwent revision of total hip arthroplasty using trabecular metal wedges from September 2010 to December 2014 were evaluated. This study included only cases of Paprosky 3A and 3B. Preoperative and postoperative images were analyzed. Non-fixation of the implant was defined by the presence of angular variation of the component higher 10 degrees or displacement greater than 6Â mm. Patients with follow-up times of less than 24 months or who did not attend the last two appointments were excluded from the study. The mean follow-up time was 39.4 months (25-61). Fixation was achieved in all cases despite its complexity. There was only one case of dislocation that was treated with open reduction. One case developed infection, and was surgically approached on two occasions, with extensive debridement and intravenous antibiotics following protocol, with good evolution. The implanted trabecular metal wedges showed excellent results in the short- and medium-term and may represent another option in the reconstruction of large acetabular defects, sometimes replacing bone reconstruction that uses bone tissue banks or autologous graft.
