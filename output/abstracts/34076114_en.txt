The scope of this study is to discuss equity and access to mental health care by means of analysis of the distribution of primary care teams (Community Health Agents; Family Health Teams; the Expanded Family Health Nucleus) and the coverage of the Psychosocial Care Network in three Northeastern states (Ceará, Piauí and Rio Grande do Norte) and their respective health regions. It is a descriptive study, supported by exploratory quantitative analysis. For this purpose, the database of the Department of Basic Care/DATASUS was used to collect secondary data in relation to the historical trajectory of training of Primary Care teams. Regarding the points of care of RAPS, the database made available by the National Mental Health Coordination of the Ministry of Health was consulted. The conclusion of the investigation was that prior to 2018 there was a major drive in the country into the interior and expansion of coverage in relation to primary and psychosocial care, impacting the expansion of equity in territories of lesser economic and social development. However, it was also observed that Psychosocial Care Network services are more prevalent in the interior while the other related services are more developed in capitals and large municipalities.
