Health workers are at high risk of exposure to contagious diseases, many of which might be prevented through vaccination. According to the Brazilian labor legislation, vaccination is a right of workers and an obligation for employers. To develop a matrix of strategic recommendations relative to the vaccination status of health workers as a function of the risks to which this occupational group is exposed. Qualitative study performed at a Health Basic Unit in November and December 2016. We held three workshops with an average of 22 participants and following a problematization method based on the Maguerez arc approach. The data collected in the workshops were recorded on a field notebook. The selected method helped the participants gain insights the process of illness and healthcare. The workshops resulted in a matrix of recommendations of strategies to orient and monitor immunizations for health workers, including: information on vaccinations recommended for health workers, vaccination status updates and occupational health surveillance. The present study provides grounds for occupational healthcare as concerns the vaccination status of the participants and other health workers. The resulting strategic recommendations aim at improving the vaccination status of health workers and thus reduce the risk of diseases preventable through immunizations, which might be a reason for sickness absenteeism, and even of indefinite sick leave.
