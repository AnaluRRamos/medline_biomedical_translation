Behçet's disease (BD) is an autoimmune condition that involves multiple systems. The most common arterial manifestation in BD patients is pseudoaneurysm, which has higher frequency than aneurysm formation. To clarify the importance of profunda femoris artery in BD pseudoaneurysm, and present a new method for identifying healthy segments for anastomosis. Fifteen patients presented at a vascular department with pseudoaneurysms of the common femoral (CFA) and superficial femoral artery (SFA), were diagnosed with BD and underwent surgical intervention at Kasr al Ainy hospitals over 2 years. All patients were male. The patients ranged in age from 30 to 40 years (mean, 33.8±2.6 years). Mean duration of the disease was 5±3.4 years. Eight (53.3%) CFA graft interpositions, six (40%) mid SFA graft interpositions, and one (6.66) distal SFA graft interposition were performed. Eight (53.3%) of these operations were performed using Dacron graft and sartorius flap, three (20%) were performed with a polytetrafluoroethylene graft, and four (26.66) with a great saphenous vein graft. Two cases (13.33%) were accidentally discovered while four cases (26.66%) had short distance claudication, four cases (26.66%) had pain at rest, and five cases (33.33%) presented with pulsatile swelling correlated with pseudoaneurysm size (p = 0.005). Patients were followed-up over 1 year for new aneurysms and recurrence. Surgical repair with muscle flap coverage, with or without ligation of profunda femoris artery, does not affect prognosis. An alternative method for identifying healthy segments of femoral artery may be frozen section and examination of the artery to decrease the risk of recurrence at the site of anastomosis.
