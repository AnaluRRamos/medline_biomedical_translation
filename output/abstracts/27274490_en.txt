To evaluate whether a new biphasic cement composed of calcium sulfate and beta tricalcium phosphate with zeta potential control could induce or lead to bone neoformation in critical defects. A critical defect of diameter 8 mm was made in the calvaria of forty male Wistar rats. In the Test Group (n = 20), the defects were filled with cement. In the Control Group (n = 20), the defect was not filled and only coagulum was present. The animals were sacrificed 7, 14, 21 and 42 days after the operation. Calvaria specimens were subjected to microtomography and were then prepared for histological analysis. The analyses included morphological assessment on the histopathology of the repair; comparative morphometric evaluation of the area of formation of bone trabeculae between the groups; and histochemical staining by means of tartrate-resistant phosphatase (TRAP) in order to identify osteoclasts. Microtomographic images of the defects filled by the cement did not show any decrease in area over the course of postoperative evolution. In the Test Group, the material continued to present a foreign-body response until the last observational periods. Histomorphological analysis showed that there were more significant groupings of giant cells in the Test Group and greater maturity of neoformed bone in the Control Group. Exogenous material was also present. Histomorphometric analysis showed that in the Control Group, the total area of bone neoformation was significantly greater (p = 0.009) and grew progressively. The giant cells presented a positive reaction to TRAP but no osteoclasts were observed. The ceramic cement did not induce or lead to bone neoformation from the microtomographic or histological point of view.
