The provision of care to adolescents who are victims of bullying is necessarily intersectoral and, as such, goes beyond the limits of the school context. Underpinned by this principle, this study mapped the care provided to an adolescent victim of bullying by the Family Health Strategy, using cartography to elaborate an analytical flow chart of the pathway taken by the patient through the health service. The care maps produced by the health professionals involved in the process showed that care was out of step, dry and had a low level of resolvability. Despite these findings, the use of this instrument allowed the health team to propose other forms of support for the adolescent. After visualizing the pathway taken by the patient through the care network, the team was able to rethink limiting approaches to health care and discover other care possibilities that go beyond physical dimensions. The care provided by the Family Health Strategy was shown to be inconsistent. However, the mapping activity clearly showed that primary care services play a crucial role in providing appropriate support to adolescent victims of bullying and breaking the cycle of violence.
