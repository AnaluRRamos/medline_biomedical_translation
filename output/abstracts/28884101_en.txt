To define the best technique for the surgical treatment of supracondylar fracture of the humerus (SFH) in children, evaluating percutaneous pinning with side wires <i>vs.</i> cross-pinning. Randomized controlled trials using the Medline, CAPES, and BIREME. The criteria for inclusion of articles criteria were: (1) randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing percutaneous wire fixation techniques, (2) SFH Gartland II B, III, and IV, and (3) children aged 1-14 years. The following were used as main variables: incidence of iatrogenic injury to the ulnar nerve and loss reduction. Eight studies were selected (521 patients) comparing surgical treatment with pinning in supracondylar fracture of the humerus in children Gartland II type B, III or IV. Iatrogenic injury to the ulnar nerve was greater with the cross-pinning technique, with RR 0.28 and <i>p</i> = 0.03, while the mini-open technique presented RR 0.14 and <i>p</i> = 0.2. A statistically significant greater loss of reduction in the lateral pinning was observed in FSU Gartland III and IV(<i>p</i> = 0.04). Based upon this meta-analysis of prospective randomized clinical trials, the following is recommended: (1) percutaneous pinning with lateral wires in supracondylar fractures of the humerus in children classified as Gartland II type B; (2) use of crossed wires for Gartland type III or IV, using the mini-open technique for the medial wire.
