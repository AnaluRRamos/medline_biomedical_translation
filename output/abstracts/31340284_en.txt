The scope of this article is to identify the prevalence of the loss of quality of sleep and associated factors among menopausal women. It is a quantitative, cross-sectional and analytical study, the variables of which were investigated by applying a structured/pre-tested questionnaire and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index with 819 menopausal women cared for under the Family Health Strategy. Simple Poisson regression was used to screen the variables (p < 0.25). For multiple analysis, Poisson regression was used based on a hierarchical model, at a significance level of 5%. Loss of quality of sleep was identified in 67% of the sample. Variables such as advanced age (PR = 1.09; CI = 1.03-1.16), moderate and severe menopausal symptoms (PR = 1.18; CI = 1.10-1.27), moderate to severe anxiety (PR = 1.17; CI = 1.10-1.25), moderate to severe depression (PR = 1.08; CI = 1.01-1.15) and arthritis/arthrosis/rheumatism (PR = 1. 07; CI = 1.01 - 1.14) revealed statistically significant associations with loss of quality of sleep. The loss of quality of sleep was highly prevalent in the population studied. Factors associated with loss of quality of sleep were advanced age, moderate to severe menopausal symptoms, moderate to severe anxiety and depression, and the presence of arthritis/arthrosis/rheumatism.
