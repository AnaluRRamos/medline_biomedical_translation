We present a 36 year-old female patient with a popliteo-femoral deep vein thrombosis whose further workup revealed a thigh tumor later diagnosed as hibernoma. Hibernoma is a very rare benign tumor stemming from vestigial remnants of fetal brown adipose cells, usually disclosed as a slow and painless growing, mass. It is impossible to distinguish it on clinical grounds from the more aggressive and ominous liposarcoma.
