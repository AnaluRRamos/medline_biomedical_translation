The aging process can alter the organization of postural control causing instability; literature shows several equipment and clinical tests whose purpose is to measure postural balance, involving different protocols and methodologies. To evaluate postural balance during the task to walk over the force platform (turn and return) and its relationship with clinic balance test (BESTest) in older adults. 60 older people of both sexes, aged 60 to 79 years, were tested in the force platform (NeuroCom Balance) and BESTest to evaluate postural balance. negative correlations were found when comparing domains of the clinical test with stabilometric parameters in time and velocity variables of the tests Step/Quick turn. The highest correlations were in the total score (time spent to perform the task - 0.41, and in the velocity left side - 0.33/right side - 0.43), as well as in the stability limit (time spent to perform the task left side - 0.34/right side - 0.37, and the equilibrium velocity left side - 0.37/right side - 0.43). There are slim correlations between the clinical test and force platform variables, showing that each test measures different parameters<i>.</i> <b>Level of evidence II, Diagnostic study - investigating a diagnostic test</b>.
