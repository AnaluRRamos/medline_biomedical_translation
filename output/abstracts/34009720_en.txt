Antimicrobial resistance in Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (SP) and the prevalence of meticillin-resistant SP (MRSP) is increasing in dogs worldwide. To evaluate the influence of hospital size on antimicrobial resistance of SP and whether restricted use of antimicrobials based on antibiograms could reduce the identification of antimicrobial resistance in SP from infected dogs. In Study 1, a total of 2,294 SP isolates from dogs with pyoderma (n = 1,858, 52 hospitals) or otitis externa (OE; n = 436, 44 hospitals) taken between 2017 and 2019 were analysed. Clinics were categorised into small, medium and large based on numbers of practicing veterinary surgeons. In Study 2, a cumulative antibiogram was constructed for 12 antimicrobials from one large veterinary clinic from 2017 to 2018. Referring to this antibiogram, the clinic introduced strict antimicrobial selection criteria to treat dogs with pyoderma and OE, starting in 2018. MRSP was identified in 981 dogs (42.8%). In large clinics, the isolation rate of MRSP was 51.1% (404 of 791), which was significantly higher (P < 0.01) than in small clinics with less than two veterinary practitioners (34.0%, 154 of 453). In the antibiogram study, the susceptibility rates of oxacillin (MPIPC, 61.5%), cefpodoxime (CPDX, 55.8%) and minocycline (MINO, 55.8%) were significantly higher in 2019 (n = 52) than in 2017 to 2018 (n = 54; MPIPC, 37.0%; CPDX, 33.3%; MINO, 20.4%; P < 0.05). Hospital size could affect the isolation rate of MRSP in dogs. Restricted use of antimicrobials for over a year based on cumulative antibiograms could reduce the resistance rate of multiple antimicrobials in SP isolated from dogs with pyoderma and OE.
