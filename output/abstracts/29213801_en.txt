Over the last 30 years, a variety of studies reporting the effects of vitamin A on memory have been published. To perform a rigorous systematic review of the literature on vitamin A and memory in order to organize evidence-based data on the subject. Four authors carried out the systematic review in accordance with strict guidelines. The terms 'vitamin A' OR 'retinol' OR 'retinoic acid' AND 'memory' OR 'cognition' OR 'Alzheimer' were searched in virtually all medical research databases. From 236 studies containing the key words, 44 were selected for this review, numbering 10 reviews and 34 original articles. Most studies used animal models for studying vitamin A and cognition. Birds, mice and rats were more frequently employed whereas human studies accounted for only two reports on brain tissue from autopsies and one on the role of isotretinoin in cognition among individuals taking this medication to treat acne. Vitamin A may be an important and viable complement in the treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease. Clinical trials are imperative and, at present, there is no evidence-based data to recommend vitamin A supplementation for the prevention or treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
