To identify the risk factors correlated with the initial treatment performed. This is a retrospective study involving a total of 272 patients diagnosed with femoral shaft fractures. Of the patients, 14% were kept at rest until the surgical treatment, 52% underwent external fixation, 10% received immediate definitive treatment, and 23% remained in skeletal traction (23%) until definitive treatment. There were six cases of fat embolism syndrome (FES), which showed that polytrauma is the main risk factor for its development and that initial therapy was not important. Polytrauma patients have a greater chance of developing FES and there was no influence from the initial treatment.
