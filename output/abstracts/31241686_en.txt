to investigate the impact of bariatric surgery on the coronary artery calcium score (CACS), and to establish predictors of progression of this score in patients with obesity. prospective study that evaluated 18 obese patients before and after bariatric surgery. All patients were submitted to computed tomography scans and blood tests (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, fasting plasma glucose, A1C, insulin, serum calcium, C-peptide and C-Reactive Protein) in order to determine CACS and Framingham risk score (FRS). the FRS decreased 50% between the pre and postoperative evaluations. The mean CACS increased significantly at the late postoperative period, going from 8.5 to 33.1. HDL levels had also increased between the pre and postoperative periods. All of the other quantitative variables reduced significantly at the postoperative evaluation. When dividing CACS into four degrees, it was observed that 22.2% presented CACS=0 at the postoperative evaluation. The prevalence of mild CACS decreased from 77.8% to 50%, while moderate CACS remained the same (11.1%). Severe CACS increased from 11.1% to 16.7%. Older ages were linked to CACS progression, and this was the only variable that presented statistical association with progression. bariatric surgery leads to positive cardiovascular outcomes, apparently regardless of CACS.
