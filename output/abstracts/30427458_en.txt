The prevalence of dissatisfaction with dental services and its association with normative and subjective oral health conditions among adult Brazilians was evaluated. This cross-sectional study used data from the last Brazilian National Oral Health Survey (SBBrasil), conducted in 2010. It was considered a representative sample of the adult Brazilian population. Data were analyzed by descriptive, univariate and multiple statistics (OR / 95% CI), with correction by the design effect. Among the 4539 adults included in the study, 614 (13.4%) reported dissatisfaction with dental services. Dissatisfaction was higher among adults who had any decayed teeth (1.61 / 1.06; 2.44), adults who were dissatisfied with their teeth and mouth (2.36 / 1.39; 4.02) and adults who had reported toothache in the previous six months (1.99 / 1.29, 3.07). The conclusion drawn was that the prevalence of dissatisfaction with dental services among Brazilian adults was low and associated to normative and subjective oral health conditions.
