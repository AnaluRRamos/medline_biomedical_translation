To understand the meanings assigned by bereaved parents to their relationships with healthcare professionals during the end-of-life hospitalization of their child. Qualitative-interpretative study based on hermeneutics. Data were collected from interviews with parents who were grieving the death of a child with cancer in the hospital and participant observation in an oncology ward. Deductive thematic analysis for data interpretation ensued. The experience of parents is the sum of all relationships during treatment. Therefore, meanings form a tangle of interrelated senses built not only in the interaction with these professionals, but also with the child and with grief itself. In relationships with professionals, meanings related to the memories of the child, negative emotions and regret were identified. The experiences and meanings of grief are shaped by the social processes and interactions experienced by the family in the hospital. The relationship with the professionals represents part of the support in coping with the grief after the child's death in the hospital, due to the perpetuity of the love shown for the child as a possible legacy in the legitimacy of the experienced interactions.
