To investigate the perception of voice use as a work tool and an instrument of artistic expression in a choir of early childhood education teachers. A qualitative research carried out by means of an ethnographic method involving the production and analysis of a field journal and participant observation. Five life-story narratives were produced alongside the participating teachers and the choir conductor. They were used as a data production methodological resource and with the aim to develop rapport between the study's subjects (researcher and participants). The narratives and field journal were analyzed from the perspective of the bibliographical review carried out on art and the previously established topics related to the object of study: Artistic and professional voice use; the influence of work organization on the teachers' voice use; and the influence of their participation in the scenic choir on their vocal health care. Art, music, and participation in a scenic choir may be an effective strategy to promote vocal health in addition to choosing lifestyles that allow for these women's exercise of self-care. There is little evidence of vocal disorder prevention and vocal health promotion programs aimed at teachers, in both the health system and the employer institutions.
