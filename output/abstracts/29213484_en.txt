Bilateral thalamic infarctions are usually caused by occlusion of the 'Artery of Percheron' (AoP). Thalamopeduncular syndrome is among the most common presentations of AoP occlusion. A 59-year-old male presented abrupt decreased level of consciousness. After several weeks, on regaining consciousness, he exhibited oculomotor abnormalities, ataxic gait, cervical dystonia, and cognitive and behavioral changes. Magnetic resonance imaging disclosed thalamic, subthalamic, mammillary and midbrain infarction. Clinical features suggestive of bilateral thalamopeduncular syndrome were identified. Besides the presence of cognitive impairment and behavioral symptoms, cervical dystonia was evident, possibly resulting from interruption of the interconnections among basal ganglia, thalamus, subthalamus, midbrain and cerebellum.
