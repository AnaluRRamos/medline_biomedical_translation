To analyze spatial distribution of tuberculosis in individuals under 15 years old and socioeconomic factors in Para√≠ba, Brazil, 2007-2016. This was an ecological study based on data from the Notifiable Health Conditions Information System (SINAN), taking each municipality to be a unit of analysis. Spatial distribution of incidence was performed, the local empirical Bayesian method and Moran's I were applied. Socioeconomic data were crossed-checked to identify areas of social prosperity. 426 cases were notified, with average incidence of 4.5/100,000 inhabitants. Moran's I was 0.59 (p=0.010). The Moran Map revealed concentration of cases in children under 15 in 38 high priority municipalities, in clusters with high-high and low-low patterns, in the east and northwest of the state, coinciding with areas of low social prosperity. There were clusters with greater tuberculosis transmission, indicating priority areas for addressing tuberculosis.
