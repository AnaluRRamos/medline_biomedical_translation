To analyze the Quality of Life of subjects with aphasia participating in an Interdisciplinary Living Group. cross-sectional and quantitative study. Convenience sample submitted to two questionnaires: a semi-structured one, developed exclusively for the characterization of the subjects and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale - Bref (WHOQOL-Bref) to identify their Quality of Life (QOL). Data analysis was descriptive. Eight subjects were interviewed, aged between 35 and 78 years and schooling between Incomplete Elementary School and Incomplete Higher Education. The predominant occupation was that of a clerk and the income varied between one and four minimum wages. The time of brain injury was from three to 10 years, caused predominantly by Stroke caused by Systemic Arterial Hypertension. As for WHOQOL, there was an important variation between the subjects in the four domains (physical, psychological, social and environmental). However, most scored above 70 points. For all subjects, the Living Group was identified as a space for the production of life and health, motivating them to seek other services. The subjects were adults and elderly people belonging to the lower-middle class; presented chronic health conditions, impaired verbal expression and long monitoring time to their health needs. The WHOQOL-Bref revealed that five subjects perceived their favorable living/health conditions, however, they highlighted reduced social contact. The Living Group became an important space for improving QOL.
