The teams that work in psychiatric wards are direct heirs of a practice marked by the institutionalizing discourse but need to dialogue with the clinic and care advocated by the Psychiatric Reform. This article aims to analyze how mental health work occurs and what are the relationships between the way of working and the health of nursing workers of a university psychiatric hospital. The theoretical reference used was based on the concepts of activity and self body by Schwartz and the dimension of health established by Canguilhem, understanding that health work is also a work of creation, of production of knowledge and use of their capacities and tacit knowledge. BasedonConversations about Work and Health carried out with the nursing teams of the Institute of Psychiatry of Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (IPUB/UFRJ), we address specific topicsrelated to nursing in mental health. We conclude that there is a very heterogeneous panel of speeches, which express the diversity of ways of thinking and acting in nursing work, so that each worker brings to the scene what they believe to be the best for the patient and it is in the name of that care ethicsthat the most dramatic issues revolvewithin a psychiatric ward.
