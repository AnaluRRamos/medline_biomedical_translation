Mean platelet volume (MPV), which is a simple measure of platelet activation, has recently become an interesting topic in cardiovascular research. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is a comprehensive intervention that decreases mortality-morbidity in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Studies on the effects of exercise on platelet activation have yielded conflicting results. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of an exercise-based CR programs on MPV in patients with stable CAD. The sample was composed of 300 consecutive stable CAD patients. The patients were divided into two groups: CR group (n = 97) and non-CR group (n = 203). Blood analysis was performed. Point-Biserial correlation measures were performed to show correlation between MPV change and CR. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. The decrease in MPV was greater in the CR group than in the non-CR group [(-1.10(-1.40-(-0.90)) vs. (-0.10 (-2.00-0.00)); p< 0.001]. ΔMPV had a positive correlation with Δ neutrophil (r = 0.326, p < 0.001), ΔTG (r = 0.439, p < 0.001), ΔLDL-c (r = 0.478, p < 0.001), ΔWBC (r = 0.412, p < 0.001), and ΔCRP (r = 0.572, p < 0.001). A significant correlation was found between ΔMPV% and CR (r=0.750, p<0.001). We were able to show that exercise-based CR has a strong relationship with MPV reduction in patients with CAD. We consider that decreased platelet activation with exercise-based CR might play an important role in reducing thrombotic risk in patients with stable CAD.
