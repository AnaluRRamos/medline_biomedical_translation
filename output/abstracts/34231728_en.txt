The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of Common Mental Disorders (CMD) among university students and analyze the relation between disorders and internet use and the use of coping strategies in the face of social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a quantitative cross-sectional study using a non-probability sample of 275 students. Data was collected online using the Self-Reporting Questionnaire, Problematic Internet Use Scale and a coping strategies inventory. We conducted a descriptive and inferential analysis of the data and multiple linear regression was performed to determine the variables that best explained the variation in the problematic internet use. Prevalence of CMD was 58.5% and the presence of CMD was positively correlated with frequency of internet use and the use of avoidant coping strategies, based on confrontation, the search for social support and acceptance of responsibility (p<0.05). The presence of CMD and the use of confrontation coping strategies were the variables that best explained problematic internet use (R2=0.33%; p<0.00). High levels of digital socialization should be taken into account in mental health care actions aimed at university students in the context of COVID-19.
