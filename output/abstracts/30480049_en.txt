Thrombosis and cancer have a very well-known association. Pancreatic cancer has the highest risk for thrombotic events amongst gastrointestinal cancers and is a leading direct cause of death in cancer patients. We assessed the role of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) in identifying distant thrombotic events in pancreatic cancer patients. We performed a retrospective review of all EUS cases for pancreatic cancer in two centers and assessed all remotely located thrombotic events diagnosed. In a period of 6 months, a total of 55 EUS for pancreatic neoplasm were performed and the following thrombotic events were identified in 4 patients (7.3%): pulmonary thromboembolism (75%) and vena cava thrombosis (25%). The authors present these 4 cases of thrombotic disease identified by EUS, 50% of them previously missed by noninvasive imaging. EUS evaluation is not seldom limited to the targeted lesion prior identified in other imaging studies. Vascular thrombus can be an incidental finding on EUS. If untreated, pulmonary embolism has a high overall mortality. This series underlines the importance of a systematic, station approach EUS technique, namely in the mediastinum, regardless of the clinical indication.
