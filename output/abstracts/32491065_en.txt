Physical activity, each type in its own manner, whether occupational, domestic or leisure, can play a significant role regarding high blood pressure (HBP). However, practicing physical activity only at leisure time, or in specific situations, can be insufficient to achieve the effective control of HBP. To analyze the isolated and cumulative effect of different types of physical activity and the prevalence of HBP among workers. A cross-sectional study with 1,070 Urban Cleaning and Footwear Industry workers in Bahia, who answered a survey, conducted by an interviewer on sociodemographic, occupational, lifestyle and hypertensive morbidity aspects. Weight, height, waist circumference and blood pressure were measured. Case of HBP: Systolic blood pressure ≥140 or diastolic blood pressure ≥90, or regular treatment for HBP. The occupational, domestic and leisure aspects of Physical Activity were studied. A multivariate analysis with Cox Regression was performed for cross-sectional studies. The prevalence of HBP was 24%, being 37% among workers aged between 35-44 years, and 51% among workers aged between 45-54 years. The multivariate model showed that workers who were active in one form of physical activity only or no forms had 62% higher BP levels and that these levels were 25% higher among workers who were active in two out of three physical activity forms. Being a male, being older (> 31 years old) and being overweight were characteristics associated with HBP, with prevalence ratios of 1.62, 2.10 and 2.26, respectively. There was a cumulative effect of the form of physical activity on the occurrence of HBP. Classifying active subjects at work or at home as inactive persons by relying only on the leisure form can lead to methodological errors. (Arq Bras Cardiol. 2020; 114(5):755-761)
