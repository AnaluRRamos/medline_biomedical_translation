To analyze the differences in nurses' clinical practice for assessing residual gastric volume and identifying the theoretical framework which supports their practice. A cross-sectional study carried out by sending an online questionnaire by e-mail to nurses registered at the Regional Nursing Council of the State of SÃ£o Paulo. This study included 598 nursing professionals, with 484 only providing care to adults and 114 exclusively to children. The gastric residual volume test is performed by 83.4% of nursing professionals; in most cases the suspension and prescription of enteral nutritional therapy are performed by the physician. Suspension of enteral nutritional therapy among adults predominantly occurs when the gastric residual volume is equal to 200 ml, and in children when values are less than 100 ml. Procedure after diet suspension involves the return of aspirated gastric contents and maintaining the catheter closed until the next hour in 48.3% of the procedures among adults, and 68.4% among children. 42.9% of the participants in this study were not aware of the theoretical basis that supports the test performance. We can highlight the need for nurses' training and further studies focused on the practice for assessing gastric residual volume.
