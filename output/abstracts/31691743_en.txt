To analyze how students with Language Disorders receive remedial teaching in inclusive settings in Portugal. We developed a questionnaire based on the literature review, and applied it to 123 elementary teachers in Portugal. We performed a descriptive and inferential statistical analysis of the dependent variables using parametric tests. Descriptive analysis revealed that most teachers know the concept of language disorders and consider it important to the development of language when supporting students with this problem. However, over half of the respondents answered that they have no training and enough information about the acquisition and development of language, and donÂ´t consider having sufficient knowledge to contribute to the identification of students with language disorders. Results for inferential statistics showed statistically significant differences regarding gender; length of service and district, as well as a good internal consistency in relation to the questionnaire. Results highlight the need for training and information about acquisition and development of language, and more specifically in relation to language disorders. It also showed that elementary teachers may find difficulties in intervention with students with language disorders, and particularly, to adequate strategies to their needs, particularly when developing Individualized Educational Programs for their students in a team.
