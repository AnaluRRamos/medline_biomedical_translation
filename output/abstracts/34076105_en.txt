This study assessed the Family Health Strategy (ESF) health care accessibility in the municipal system, which is the health macro-region headquarters in Bahia. It consisted of two levels of analysis: the municipal management and the local organization of ESF teams. Data production combined documentary analysis, non-participant observation, and interviews with managers, professionals, and users. Goal-image was used with evaluative criteria and dimensions of the accessibility in Primary Care. Family Health Teams (EqSF) still do not entirely fulfill the role of preferential contact in municipal health services, and the health care accessibility reflects the interdependence of municipal and local factors. Rural and peripheral teams performed better in organizational accessibility, and central urban teams performed better in geographic accessibility. The assessment focused on geographic and organizational criteria, combining different sources of evidence and health system players using analysis levels considering the municipal and local PHC management are relevant contributions of this study, which can be extended to other municipal systems with similar characteristics.
