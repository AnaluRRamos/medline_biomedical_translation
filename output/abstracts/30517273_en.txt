To investigate the sensitivity and internal consistency of the Psychosocial Scale of Facial Appearance (PSFA) based on the comparison between its results and those from other facial functional assessment instruments: House-Brackmann scale (HBS) and Facial Grading System - and the psychosocial implications measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the aforementioned Institution under protocols no. 196.977 and 230.982. Thirty-eight adult individuals with Peripheral Facial Palsy (PFP) were submitted to closed interviews in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the questionnaire. Statistical analyses were conducted for each stage of this study. Data were entered in Excel® spreadsheet and analyzed using SPSS 17.0 and AMOS 22.0 for Windows®. Study participants were 38 individuals with PFP aged 19-78 years with predominance of idiopathic paralysis (44.7%). Results of the Cronbach's Alpha coefficient showed strong internal consistency between the thematic groups and the questions; however, Confirmatory Factor Analysis indicated some questions with week causal relationship between thematic groups, namely, questions 5 and 6 of the group Functional Aspects of Face, question 17 of the group Social Aspects, and question 23 of the group Emotional Aspects. This study provided the first steps for the subsidy and support of an instrument designed to investigate the psychosocial aspects associated with PFP, enabling the preparation of questions and their organization into thematic groups. However, further studies are needed to conclude the validation processes.
