To describe the main ultrasound findings of chikungunya fever in the ankle. This was a cross-sectional observational study involving 52 patients referred to the Hospital Universit√°rio Pedro Ernesto and presenting with clinical and biochemical evidence of chikungunya fever. The examinations were performed by a radiologist with more than 20 years of experience in ultrasound. The predominant gender was female (in 88.5%), and the mean age was 58.4 years. The majority (61.5%) of the patients came from the northern part of the city of Rio de Janeiro, and 46.2% were using corticosteroids to treat inflammatory symptoms. The most common alterations observed by ultrasound were joint effusion (in 69.2%), tenosynovitis (in 59.6%), cellulitis (in 46.2%), Kager's fat pad thickening (in 29.9%), myositis (of the soleus or flexor hallucis longus muscle) (in 17.3%), retrocalcaneal bursitis (in 5.8%), tendon ruptures (in 3.8%), and increased vascular flow on power Doppler (in 3.8%). Signs of synovitis and tenosynovitis were the main ultrasound findings in a predominantly female population with a mean age of 58.4 years. Further studies are needed in order to define the role of ultrasound in the follow-up of such patients.
