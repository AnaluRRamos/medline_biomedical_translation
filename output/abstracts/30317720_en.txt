Free-floating thrombus in an otherwise normal ascending aorta is a rare finding. We report the case of a 61-year-old woman admitted for brain and peripheral arterial embolisms. Echocardiography was not able to detect the source of embolus. Computed tomographic scan demonstrated a large floating mass attached to the posterior wall of the distal ascending aorta. The thrombus was successfully removed with the patient under deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. Some aspects regarding pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment are discussed.
