Arterial stiffness is an important predictor factor of aortopathy and myocardial remodeling in patients with a bicuspid aortic valve and it might be increased in childhood. To assess the arterial stiffness and left ventricular myocardial function in children with a well-functioning bicuspid aortic valve. Forty-four children with a bicuspid aortic valve and 41 healthy peers with a tricuspid aortic valve were included in this case-control study. Diameters and the related z-scores of the aortic root and ascending aorta were obtained. As for the left ventricular myocardial function, along with the mitral inflow velocities and M-Mode parameters, myocardial velocities and time intervals were assessed with tissue Doppler imaging. A pulse wave analysis was performed by oscillometric device (Mobil-o-Graph). A p value <0.05 was considered significant. The left ventricular mass index, mitral inflow A velocity, diameter and z-score of the ascending aorta, and myocardial performance index were significantly higher in patients (p=0.04, p=0.02,p=0.04, p<0.001,and p<0.001 respectively). The myocardial performance index was positively correlated with the diameter of the ascending aorta and A velocity (r=0.272;p=0.01, r=356;p=0.001, respectively). The multivariate analysis revealed that the myocardial performance index was related to the ascending aorta diameter (p=0.01). The augmentation index and pulse wave velocity were similar between the groups (p>0.05). According to the oscillometric pulse wave analysis, the children with a well-functioning bicuspid aortic valve had similar arterial stiffness to that of the healthy peers. The ascending aorta diameter was established as an independent predictor of left ventricular myocardial function. Arterial stiffness may not be a severe risk factor in pediatric patients without marked ascending aorta dilation.
