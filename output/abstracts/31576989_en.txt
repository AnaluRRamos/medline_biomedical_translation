to evaluate the clinical and pathological characteristics and survival of young patients with gastric cancer, regardless of the intention of treatment. we conducted a retrospective analysis of all gastric cancer patients undergoing any surgical treatment between 2008 and 2017. We considered patients under 45 years old as young adults and those over 45 years old, as of advanced age. of the 875 patients evaluated, 84 (9.6%) were young adults and 791 (90.4%) were older. Younger patients were associated with female gender (p<0.001), lower Charlson score (p=0.002), ASA I/II (p<0.001), diffuse Lauren type (p<0.001) and poorly differentiated tumors (p<0.001). There was no difference between groups regarding treatment intention (palliative versus curative) (p=0.267) and cTNM clinical stage (p=0.120). Disease-free survival was worse in younger individuals (p=0.049), but overall survival was similar between groups (p=0.578). Multivariate analysis identified total gastrectomy, pT3/T4, pN+, and diffuse Lauren type as prognostic factors associated with worse disease-free survival and overall survival. Age was not an independent factor associated with worse prognosis. although younger patients had lower disease-free survival, overall survival was similar between groups, and age was not a significant independent prognostic factor.
