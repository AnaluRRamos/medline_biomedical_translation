: The objective was to describe the governance system used in structuring the regionalized healthcare network in Santa Catarina State, Brazil, based on the Bipartite Inter-Managerial Commission (CIB), with a focus on structuring of oral healthcare. This was a qualitative, exploratory-descriptive documental study, based on the foundations of governance as an analytical tool through identification of the dimensions actors, norms, nodal points, and processes. Secondary data were collected from the minutes of CIB meetings held from January 2011 to December 2015. The analysis shows weaknesses in CIB governance in Santa Catarina in relation to regionalized structuring of oral healthcare from a network perspective. Structuring of oral healthcare occurs in parallel to that of other thematic networks in the state and shows the expansion of dental services, especially those with medium complexity, as an effect of the prevailing governance process. The relations established between administrators and decision-making processes allowed recognizing this network's 'prescription', since there is little negotiation and local demand, limited more to following recommendations and incentives from the federal/state sphere, intermediated by staff from the State Health Secretariat. Thus, setting a policy agenda for oral healthcare for the population of Santa Catarina is weakened, with a peripheral position in relation to other health programs.
