To evaluate the correlation between postoperative quality of life and the severity of hallux valgus deformity. A total of 23 patients underwent moderate (n = 14) and severe (n = 9) hallux valgus (HV) surgical correction with the Scarf technique between January 2010 and December 2012. The mean follow-up time was 60 months. Participants answered the SF-36 quality of life assessment questionnaire and their radiographs were evaluated at three different moments (preoperative, 1 and 5 years after surgery). Statistical analysis was performed with a maximum 5% significance level. The sample consisted of two men and 21 women, aged 58.7.SF-36 mean value was 75.73 and the metatarsophalangeal and interphalangeal angles improved significantly at the three moments (p < 0.05). SF-36 showed no statistical difference between patients with moderate or severe HV (p > 0.05). No correlations were found between quality of life and pre and postoperative radiographic angles. Patients with moderate and severe hallux valgus submitted to surgical correction had a very good quality of life and a significant improvement in radiographic parameters. However, these variables were not correlated. <i>Level of Evidence II, Retrospective study.</i>
