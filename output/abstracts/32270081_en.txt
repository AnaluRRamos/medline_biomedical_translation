The social function of individuals with schizophrenia is usually poor and this population exhibits a sedentary lifestyle. Social participation, inclusion in the world of work in particular, might favorably interfere with the lives of these individuals by reducing sedentarism and improving their state of health. To analyze the lipid profile and endothelial function markers among individuals with schizophrenia enrolled in a supported employment program. Quantitative quasi-experimental study conducted with 14 individuals with schizophrenia enrolled in a labor inclusion program. Participants were assessed before enrolment (time-point 1) and one year later (time-point 2). Total cholesterol and fractions, triglycerides, serum nitrates and nitrites (endothelial function markers) were measured. The data were analyzed with software SPSS 20. The high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels exhibited significant changes one year after inclusion in the labor market. HDL increased from 82.30 to 98.60 mg/dL (p<0.01) and LDL decreased from 54.50 to 44.45 mg/dL (p<0.02). The triglyceride and total cholesterol levels remained stable. The nitrate and nitrite level exhibited significant reduction from 15.20 to 14.48 ÂµMol (p<0.01). Participation in the supported employment program might have favorably influenced the participants' lipid profile and endothelial function. Nitrites have been described as mediators in the neural inflammatory process, and reduction of their levels is associated with better prognosis of chronic diseases such as schizophrenia.
