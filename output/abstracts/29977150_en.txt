The use of intramedullary nailing to treat proximal femoral fractures has increased in recent years. Nail breakage is a rare complication of intramedullary nailing of the femur, and generally occurs at the non-united fracture site. Removal of the distal fragment of a broken nail is a challenging problem. In this article, the authors describe the methods used to remove strongly fixed broken intramedullary nails. Level of Evidence IV; Case series.
