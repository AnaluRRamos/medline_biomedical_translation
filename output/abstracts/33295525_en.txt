To understand the implications of the assistance provided to people with suicidal behavior within the scope of the Psychosocial Care Network, from the perspective of users and health professionals. A qualitative research, under the theoretical framework of complex and methodological thinking in Grounded Theory. Interviews were conducted from May to December 2017, with users assisted due to suicidal behavior and with health professionals in psychosocial care settings. The comparative data analysis technique was used. 18 users and health professionals participated. Non-acceptance intensifies users' introspection, demotivation and hopelessness, increasing the difficulty of exposing their desires. In situations of embracement, availability and bonding with professionals, patients feel more open, to the point of giving new meanings to life and reducing thoughts of death. Weaknesses and potentialities were noticed in the care provided by health professionals to users with suicidal behavior, within the scope of the Psychosocial Care Network. The need for management committed to the quality of care in the face of the risk of suicide stands out.
