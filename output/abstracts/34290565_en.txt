This study aimed to identify the most used scales in the assessment of the clinical outcomes for the treatment of osteochondral lesions of the talus. We performed a systematic review of the PubMed/MEDLINE databases from September 1999 to September 2019, based on the guidelines established by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). The research strategy was: osteochondral [All Fields], AND ('talus' [MeSH Terms] OR 'talus' [All Fields]) AND lesion [All Fields]. Of the 364 articles found in the literature, 166 (45%) were included in the study and 198 (55%) excluded. In total, 23 clinical assessment tools were used in the studies. We found 49.4% of the studies to use the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society Ankle-Hindfoot Scale (AOFAS Ankle-Hindfoot Scale) and 29.5% the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The use of AOFAS increased in relation to VAS in the last 6 years (<i>p</i> = 0.046), and these two scales, either alone or combined, were the most used for studying osteochondral lesions of the talus<i>. Level of Evidence III, Systematic Review of Level II studies.</i>
