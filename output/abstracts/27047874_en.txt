Tibiotalar (TT) arthrodesis is still a very important option in the treatment of primary or post-traumatic arthritis of the ankle but persists the controversy regarding the optimal method for the fixation of the arthrodesis site. No matter the implant used, the goal is to obtain a solid, healthy, pain-free fusion. The purpose of the current study is to present the preliminary results of a novel laterally based tibiotalar compression arthrodesis system using a locked plate. Thirteen consecutive patients with tibiotalar arthritis were submitted to an arthrodesis using a new lateral plating system. The average age was 59.7 years (range 36~72); nine patients were male and four female. Using a cutting guide, the remaining articular surfaces of the tibia and talus were removed. A compression device was applied to avoid malalignment of the ankle and a precontoured lateral locking plate was used to achieve the joint fusion. Both the AOFAS ankle-hindfoot score and the VAS score improved with the surgery. All patients' ankles fused by 6 months. In all patients we found a very good alignment in the sagittal, coronal and transverse planes. We believe that a combination of a bilateral compression, contoured bony cuts, and lateral locked plating offers a novel, accurate and useful technique for ankle arthrodesis.
