Canine atopic dermatitis (cAD) is a common allergic skin disease that is known to affect individuals early in life; the natural history of its initial development has not been documented. Some breeds such as West Highland white terriers (WHWTs) are highly predisposed to cAD. To follow 100 WHWT puppies during their first three years and to record the onset of clinical signs of cAD. One hundred and eight puppies from 29 litters were included and 90 were followed for three years. Puppies were examined initially while with their breeders. After adoption, the owners were contacted twice each year and dogs were examined by veterinarians if signs compatible with cAD were detected; diagnosis of cAD was by two different definitions. The onset, location of the clinical signs and severity of cAD, as well as co-morbidities were recorded. The prevalence of cAD in the cohort was 52%. Most affected dogs (60%) developed signs of cAD during their first year of life and males were over-represented. The location of clinical signs mirrored those of previous descriptions. The severity of cAD was mild in 36% and severe in 13% of affected WHWTs. Dogs with cAD often exhibited other atopic diseases, but only gastro-intestinal signs were significantly different between WHWTs with and without cAD. Adverse reaction to foods was diagnosed in 24% of dogs. This longitudinal study of puppies from a predisposed breed sheds new light on the early development of cAD in WHWTs.
