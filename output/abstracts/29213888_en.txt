Diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) requires a reliable neuropsychological assessment, but major barriers are still encountered when such tests are used across cultures and during the lifespan. This is particularly problematic in developing countries where most of the available assessment tools have been adapted from developed countries. This represents a major limitation as these tests, although properly translated, may not embody the wealth of challenges that a particular culture poses on cognition. This paper centers on two shortcomings of available cognitive tests for AD, namely, their sensitivity to the educational background and to the age of the individual assessed.
