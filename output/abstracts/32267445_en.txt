Breastfeeding is considered the ideal feeding method early in life. Despite the scientific evidence, the worldwide prevalence of breastfeeding is low. Maternal work is pointed out as one of the obstacles to maintain this practice. To systematically review studies that evaluated the association between institutional aspects and breastfeeding and exclusive breastfeeding among working women. A literature search until June 2016 was carried out using PubMed, LILACS, and SciELO (MeSH terms: breastfeeding, workplace and observational study). Eighteen observational studies were included. A positive association with breastfeeding were found for later or not return to work, part-time work, availability or the use of lactation room, breast pumping breaks, professional advice on maintaining breastfeeding after returning to work, and attendance at breastfeeding support program. A negative association with breastfeeding was shown for full-time work. Simple interventions in the workplace and some changes in company policy to encourage breastfeeding can positively influence its maintenance after women return to work.
