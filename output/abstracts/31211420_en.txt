Cerebral palsy (CP) is a complex disorder and children frequently have multiple impairments. Dystonia is a particularly frustrating impairment that interferes with rehabilitation and function and is difficult to treat. Of the available treatments, deep brain stimulation (DBS) has emerged as an option with the potential for large effect size in a subgroup of children. While brain stimulation has been used in CP for more than 40Â years, modern devices and targeting methods are improving both the safety and efficacy of the procedure. Successful use of DBS depends on appropriate selection of patients, identification of effective neuroanatomical targets in each patient, careful neurosurgical procedure, and detailed follow-up evaluation and programming. The use of functional neurosurgery for neuromodulation in CP remains a technology in its infancy, but improving experience and knowledge are likely to make this one of the safest and most effective interventions for children with moderate-to-severe motor disorders. This review summarizes the current procedures for patient and target selection, and surgical implantation of DBS electrodes for CP. The history of DBS and future directions when used in secondary dystonia are also examined. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Selection of candidates for deep brain stimulation (DBS) requires understanding of dystonia in cerebral palsy . DBS could become a first-line treatment option in some children.
