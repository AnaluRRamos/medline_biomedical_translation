To investigate the association of suicide attempt (SA) with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PSTD), Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) and variables related to socioeconomic and demographic aspects in a cohort of women enrolled in the Family Health Strategy in Recife. A cross-sectional study was carried out, nested in a prospective cohort study with 644 women aged 18 to 49 enrolled in the Family Health Strategy of the Sanitary District II of Recife, PE, between July 2013 and December 2014. The SA was evaluated by the question 'Have you ever tried to end your life?' PTSD was diagnosed through the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist - Civilian Version (PCL-C). A hierarchical modeling was performed, applying the Ï‡2 test and Standardized Waste Analysis. The association of the independent variables with SA was estimated through simple and adjusted Logistic Regression. The prevalence of SA was 10.9%, and the frequency of PSTD was 16%. Women who had PTSD and those who did not have a religion showed higher risk for suicide (odds ratio - OR = 5.11, 95%CI 2.9 - 8.7, OR = 1.76, 95%CI 1.0 - 2.9 respectively). There was a higher risk of SA in women who had PTSD and low adherence to a religion. Thus, it was understood that coping with PTSD comes from preventing, treating and promoting greater knowledge about this disorder, in addition to aggregating and social protective effect promoted by religiosity, which can be a strategy for the reduction and prevention of SA.
