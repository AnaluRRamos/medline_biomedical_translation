Portomesenteric vein thrombosis (PMVT) is a potentially severe complication that can occur after bariatric surgery. PMVT has gained importance because of the increasing number of bariatric surgeries being performed. to report a rare and severe complication after bariatric surgery, which is difficult to manage. To try to identify common characteristics among the cases and discuss potential causes comparing our data to the available literature. We describe six cases of PMVT in young women with different presentations. All six cases occurred in young women 29-41 years old with obesity - body mass index - BMI: 36-39) and weighing 105-121 kg. The patients had few comorbidities (all of which were related to metabolic syndrome) and moderate hepatic steatosis with no sign of cirrhosis. Five patients used oral contraceptives until a few days before the operation. One patient tested positive for thrombophilia. Five patients underwent a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and one underwent a gastric bypass with no complications during the operation (median operating time: 61.3 min, range 52-91 min). The mean duration of follow-up after hospitalization was 12.3 months (range: 7-18 months) and to-date only one patient has had no recanalization. The frequency of PMVT appears to be increased in woman and after sleeve gastrectomy. Our findings indicate that patients with abdominal pain weeks after bariatric surgery must be investigated.
