To evaluate the relationship between vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphism (<i>FokI</i> [rs10735810]) and serum vitamin D concentration in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).  A prospective case-control study that recruited healthy pregnant women (control group) (<i>n = </i>78) and women with GDM (GDM group) (<i>n = </i>79), with no other comorbidities. Peripheral blood samples were collected in the 3<sup>rd</sup> trimester of gestation, and all of the pregnant women were followed-up until the end of the pregnancy and the postpartum period. Serum vitamin D concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). For genomic polymorphism analysis, the genomic DNA was extracted by the dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide/cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB/CTAB) method, and genotyping was performed by the polymerase chain reaction - restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique, using the restriction enzyme <i>FokI</i>. The Student-t, Mann-Whitney, chi-squared, and Fischer exact tests were used for the analysis of the results.  There was no significant difference between the pregnant women in the control and GDM groups regarding serum vitamin D levels (17.60 ± 8.89 ng/mL versus 23.60 ± 10.68 ng/mL; <i>p</i> = 0.1). Also, no significant difference was detected between the <i>FokI</i> genotypic frequency when the 2 groups were compared with each other (<i>p</i> = 0.41).  There was no association between the <i>FokI</i> polymorphism and the development of GDM, nor was there any change in serum vitamin D levels in patients with GDM.
