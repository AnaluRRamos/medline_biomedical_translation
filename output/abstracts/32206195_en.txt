Mild cognitive decline is a feared aspect of aging associated with frailty experienced by individuals. To determine the number of elderly people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI); to determine the relationship of sociodemographic and clinical variables by group of individuals with or without MCI and to determine the relationship between MCI assessed by 6CIT and the cognitive domains assessed by the MoCA. A correlational study was conducted of 44 elderly individuals attending a day-care center or residing in a care home, with an average age of 88.9 Â± 8.8 years who answered a structured interview collecting sociodemographic and clinical data. The elderly living at home had higher average body mass index and number of pathologies than those living in an institution for the elderly (p < 0.01). 63.6% of the elderly did not have MCI, and no differences were found between residential settings. The comparison between 6CIT and MoCA yielded differences in the general domain and in visual, attention, abstraction and, orientation subdomains. Cognitive stimulation interventions should be optimized according to the residential setting at the level of comorbidities and nutrition.
