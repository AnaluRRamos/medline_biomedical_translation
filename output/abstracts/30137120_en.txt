The aim of the present study was to evaluate factors associated with falls in community-dwelling older adults diagnosed with cataracts. An analytical, cross-sectional study was conducted with a sample of community-dwelling older adults residing in the Federal District of Brazil. Interviews and assessment tools were administered, such as the Timed Up and Go test, Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), Biodex Balance System, Katz Index, Lawton Scale, Minnesota Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire and Mini Mental State Examination. Statistical analysis involved binary logistic regression. One hundred forty-two older adults (85 with cataracts) participated in the study (mean age: 69.39 Â± 5.67 years). Falls were associated with the female sex (OR: 4.45) and sub-maximum score on the SPPB (OR: 3.53) among patients with cataracts, whereas multimorbidity (OR: 5.10) was the risk factor risk for older adults without cataracts. The data suggest different risk factors for falls among older adults diagnosed with cataracts.
