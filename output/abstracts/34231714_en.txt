This article presents and problematizes innovation actions aimed at improving the quality of Primary Health Care (PHC), describing an experience that can be adapted to different contexts, considering diverse sociodemographic, economic, cultural and epidemiological realities. We conducted an exploratory study using documentary sources referring to the implementation of the Campo Grande Laboratory for Innovation in Primary Health Care (INOVAAPS). The project proposes the reorientation of the care model adopted in the municipality's public primary care services, redefining work processes and improving the quality of practice. We identified product, process and organizational innovations that have the potential to transform and tailor health care practices to the population's health needs. It is concluded that the proposals implemented by the project focus on the consolidation and expansion of access to primary care, recruitment and training of adequately qualified health professionals, adoption of resolutive technologies, regulatory improvement, and strengthening the mediating role of primary health care.
