To identify theoretical frameworks and instruments for the evaluation of critical thinking to base studies in nursing and education. Integrative review, with a selection of scientific articles in Portuguese, English and Spanish, in the LILACS, SCIELO, IBECS, MEDLINE/PubMed and SCOPUS databases, using the descriptors 'thought', 'teaching' and 'nursing' in Portuguese and English. The search resulted in 3,147 articles, and 23 papers published between 2010 and 2015 were selected. Fourteen (60.2%) studies used the Facione framework and eight (34.4%) resorted to different critical thinking assessment tools applied in nursing and education. Most studies used the Facione framework. Among the evaluation tools, the California Critical Thinking Skills Test (CCTST) and the Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Appraisal stood out as the most common instruments; both focus on cognitive skills in critical thinking.
