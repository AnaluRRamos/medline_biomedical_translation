In this interview, one of today's best-known French medievalists, Jean-Claude Schmitt, responds to various questions about his theoretical and methodological choices as well as the themes of his recent work. Schmitt is known as one of the main heirs of the anthropological history of Jacques Le Goff, and sums up his trajectory which resulted in a variety of work ranging from editing documents to work on medieval images, without ever losing sight of his commitment to questioning the beliefs of men and sojourns into the imagery of the Middle Ages in western culture.
