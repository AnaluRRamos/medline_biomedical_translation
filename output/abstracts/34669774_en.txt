Mortality in prisons, a basic indicator of the right to health for incarcerated persons, has never been studied extensively in Brazil. An assessment of all-cause and cause-specific mortality in prison inmates was conducted in 2016-2017 in the state of Rio de Janeiro, based on data from the Mortality Information System and Prison Administration. Mortality rates were compared between prison population and general population after standardization. The leading causes of death in inmates were infectious diseases (30%), cardiovascular diseases (22%), and external causes (12%). Infectious causes featured HIV/AIDS (43%) and TB (52%, considering all deaths with mention of TB). Only 0.7% of inmates who died had access to extramural health services. All-cause mortality rate was higher among prison inmates than in the state's general population. Among inmates, mortality from infectious diseases was 5 times higher, from TB 15 times higher, and from endocrine diseases (especially diabetes) and cardiovascular diseases 1.5 and 1.3 times higher, respectively, while deaths from external causes were less frequent in prison inmates. The study revealed important potentially avoidable excess deaths in prisons, reflecting lack of care and exclusion of this population from the Brazilian Unified National Health System. This further highlights the need for a precise and sustainable real-time monitoring system for deaths, in addition to restructuring of the prison staff through implementation of the Brazilian National Policy for Comprehensive Healthcare for Persons Deprived of Freedom in the Prison System in order for inmates to fully access their constitutional right to health with the same quality and timeliness as the general population.
