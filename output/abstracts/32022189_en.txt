The study analyzes the differences among cases of violence against women registered in police reports (PR) at the Women's Protection Police Station (WPPS) during regular working hours, and those registered during after-hours, in a medium-sized city in the inland state of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. This is a cross-sectional study based on data from PRs registered for one year (2013/2014). PRs were differentiated by period of registration, at regular working hours and after-hours (dependent variable). A chi-square test was used to compare groups. In total, 440 PRs were registered, 373 during regular working hours, and 67 during after-hours. Cases of violence registered during after-hours evidenced more significant threats to women's integrity, as shown by the higher number of cases of perpetrators' flagrante delicto, requests for protective measures and greater severity of assaults, such as bruises, need for hospitalization and referral to forensic medicine (IML), which characterize the greater severity of occurrences when WPPS are closed. Thus, women lack a specialized reception service and a full guarantee of rights in periods of highest risk and vulnerability.
