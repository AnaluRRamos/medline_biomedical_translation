The policy for Productive Development Partnerships emerged in Brazil as a Federal Government strategy to strengthen the Health Economic-Industrial Complex. Although the first partnership dates back to 2009, the regulatory framework was only consolidated in 2014, when eight policy objectives were described. Of these, this article is intended to specifically evaluate the fourth objective: 'to protect the interests of the Public Administration and society by seeking economic savings and advantage, considering prices, quality, technology, and social benefits'. An assessment of the policy results was performed through a mixed methodological approach, by proposing four assessment indicators. The quantative analysis results confirmed a reduction in the purchase price for 37 of the 39 drugs assessed after the policy implementation, while there was an increase in the amounts purchased in 38 of the 39 drugs. On the other hand, the qualitative analysis revealed a lack of planning by public administrators and lack of compliance with the policy guidelines related to the principle of advantageousness. Approximately 40% of the drugs studied did not undergo a health technology assessment by the Brazilian National Commission for the Incorporation of Technologies in the Unified Health System, raising doubts with regards to the advantage for the Public Administration, which is measured by the cost-effectiveness of the drugs incorporated by the policy.
