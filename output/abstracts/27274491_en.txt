The Hip Function Recovery Score questionnaire is an instrument that was developed for evaluating the functional recovery of patients over 60 years of age who undergo surgical treatment due to hip fractures. The objective of this study was to make a thorough transcultural translation of this questionnaire, with adaptation to the individual and cultural traits of the Brazilian population. This translation method consisted of initial translation, back translation, drafting of a consensual version and pretesting with comments invited. Subsequently, a final version was drawn up after making the necessary adjustments, without altering the semantics of the questions in the original text. The consensual version was applied to thirty patients over the age of 60 years who had undergone surgical treatment due to hip fractures. However, some difficulties in understanding some words and expressions were observed, and these were then replaced with terms that were more easily understood. After the final version had been drawn up, this was applied to the same patients and full understanding was achieved among some of them, without altering the semantics of the questions of the original text. The transcultural translation of the Hip Function Recovery Score will have an immediate impact on functional evaluations on patients over 60 years of age who underwent surgery due to hip fracture. It will subsequently be possible for other Brazilian scientific studies to use this questionnaire, which has been standardized and adapted to Brazilian culture, in order to make comparisons between results, thereby enriching Brazilian scientific production.
