Bone graft harvesting from the anterior iliac crest is a good option for reconstructing mandibular defects after trauma or other diseases. In order to achieve optimal clinical results in reconstructive surgeries with bone grafts, accurate preoperative planning and prestigious surgical technique are paramount. Therefore, this paper describes the use of a customizable template that is indicated for obtaining free iliac bone block for immediate or late mandibular reconstructions following marginal or segmental defects. The template is based on a piece of malleable metal obtained from an aluminum beverage can. It is used transoperatively to demarcate the bone graft donor site, being especially useful because of the limited access to the inner table of the anterior ilium. The described customizable template has been shown as a useful tool to easily determine the size of the bone block to be harvested from the iliac region, improving surgical time and preventing removal of insufficient bone graft.
