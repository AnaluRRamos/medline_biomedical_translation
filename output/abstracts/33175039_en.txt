The More Doctors Program (PMM) launched in 2013 has set major changes in the health sector in motion. However, several changes in its operation have been noted in recent years due to a range of social and political events. This article seeks to identify and analyze the repercussions of the PMM in the Brazilian media after the impeachment occurred in 2016. It is an exploratory study based on the analysis of the subject matter gathered from the identification, selection and analysis of news coverage published in three newspapers with widespread circulation throughout Brazil (Jornal O Globo, Folha de São Paulo and Estadão), in the period from August 2016 to June 2018. The data collected were processed using Iramuteq software. The results reveal that the Cuban physicians and issues related to medical education and governability of the PMM were at the center of public news attention after the impeachment, with social actors beginning to defend new stances. Thus, although the implementation of the PMM is already well advanced and has popular support, important changes are being made and require thorough evaluation, seeking to guarantee the rights already acquired.
