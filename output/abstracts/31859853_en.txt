The paper reflected on the Brazilian Nursing education from the regulation of Unified Health System in a comparative historical perspective of the evolutionary processes of the Anglo-American and French schools, influencing Brazilian nursing education, as well as the guiding aspect of nursing education for the Unified Health System. Thus, nursing training initiatives guided by the National Curriculum Guidelines are developed to provide meaningful experiences in the Unified Health System's daily routine, as well as the transforming movement of Permanent Health Education in the context of the world of work. Therefore, overcoming training challenges must consider the social, political, and cultural path of the profession in order to allow changes that affect pedagogical projects, course offerings, teaching-learning methodologies, and daily work.
