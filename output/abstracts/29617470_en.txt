To determine the applicability of the generic instrument Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL 4.0) to assess health-related quality of life of asthmatic children compared to the specific instrument Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (PAQLQ). This research involved the evaluation of 30 children aged seven to eleven years, who had been diagnosed with asthma for at least six months prior to research. Both quality of life questionnaires were applied to children by an interviewer over the period of one day. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) 20.0, with significance level set at 5%. No differences in quality of life was found when genders were compared. Asthmatic children classified as practitioners and non-practitioners of physical activity had different scores in the physical health-related domain (PedsQL 4.0). The scores of children with different levels of asthma severity and control were significantly different in two out of three domains evaluated by PAQLQ. When assessed by PedsQL 4.0, no significant difference was observed as to quality of life of children with different levels of asthma control and severity. Quality of life measurements of asthmatic children by PedsQL 4.0 and PAQLQ instruments had a moderate and significant correlation (r=0.415, p=0.02). PedsQL 4.0 could distinguish children practicing different levels of physical activity, but it was not sensitive enough to distinguish health-related quality of life among children with different levels of asthma severity and control.
