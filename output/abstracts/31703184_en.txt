Hospitalizations due to angioedema are important especially in debilitating or life-threatening situations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency and etiology of angioedema without urticaria in hospital admissions. The admissions between 2009 and 2013 in Centro Hospitalar Lisboa Norte with a diagnosis grouped under the ICD9 codes of angioedema were retrospectively analysed. The episodes of angioedema with urticaria were excluded. The admissions were categorized into 2 groups: A - hospitalizations motivated by the angioedema; B - hospitalizations in which the angioedema was an incidental finding. There were 169 hospitalizations (52% females, 96% adults, mean age 52 ± 20.8 years), distributed by 23 hospital departments, 51% in the Immunoallergology department. The mean annual angioedema admission rate was 72/100 000. In 68% of the cases, angioedema was the cause for the admission; in 32% an incidental finding. In 38% there was upper airway involvement. The etiologies were: hereditary angioedema in 24%, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor induced angioedema in 31%, idiopathic angioedema in 21%, thrombolysis induced angioedema in 13%, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced angioedema in 5%. The main etiology was angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor angioedema, followed by hereditary angioedema and thrombolysis induced angioedema, and these findings concur with the international literature. The mean annual angioedema admission rate was 72/100 000 and there was airway involvement in 38% of hospitalizations.
