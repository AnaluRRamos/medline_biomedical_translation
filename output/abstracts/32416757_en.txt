Skull fractures are rare in newborns and normally caused by maternal abdominal trauma or complicated deliveries. However, in rare cases, these fractures are found in neonates born after an uneventful pregnancy and delivery. We report a case of a primigravida who underwent cesarean delivery due to failure of descent and malpositioning of the fetal head. After birth, a right temporoparietal fracture and congenital muscular torticollis were diagnosed. The newborn's blood tests showed hypocalcemia and relative hypoparathyroidism. Both mother and newborn presented low vitamin D levels. Serial imaging control showed gradual resolution of the lesions, with the newborn being discharged at the 10th day of life with vitamin D supplementation. This is an interesting case because the combination of three conditions - maternal and fetal hypovitaminosis D, congenital torticollis and malposition of the cephalic pole during labor - may have synergistically contributed to a spontaneous intrauterine skull fracture.
