To verify the effects of PM2.5 and temperature on mortality due to cardiovascular diseases according to socioeconomic status and traffic proximity. Time series were used, using the generalized additive models with the Poisson regression option, at 5% significance level. Interactionbetween proximity of traffic and socioeconomic status was analyzed through stratification. The proximity to the traffic was divided into distances up to 150m or over 150m. Socioeconomic status in the residential environment was categorized as high and low based on the median (3.9%). The relative risk percentage (%RR) of cardiovascular disease deaths was calculated for each linear increase of 10 µg/m3 at PM2.5 and 1ºC at the maximum temperature. Mortality due to cardiovascular diseases presented %RR 1.64 (95%CI -0.03; 3.33), related to the maximum temperature and %RR 4.60 (95%CI 0.78; 8.56) related to PM2.5, in areas with high traffic exposure. In areas with poor living conditions, %RR 1.34 (95%CI -0.31; 3.01) was observed, related to maximum temperature and RR% 3.95 (95%CI -0.27; 8.34) associated with PM2.5. Areas with poor living conditions and high-exposure to vehicular traffic had an increased risk of cardiovascular disease mortality related to high temperature and PM2.5.
