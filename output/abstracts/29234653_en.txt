To determine whether the use of autograft associated with platelet-rich plasma (PRP) increases bone healing in patients undergoing lumbar fusion. This was a prospective, descriptive, and comparative study, which included 40 patients undergoing lumbar fusion, who were divided into two groups: group I, autograft only, and group II, autograft associated with PRP. After surgery, patients were followed-up on the first, third, and sixth month. The Molinari radiographic classification and Glassman tomographic classification were used as criteria to analyze the bone consolidation. Comparing the group I with group II, according to the criteria of Molinari, bilateral fusion was observed in 27.5% of the patients in group I in the first month after surgery. In group II, the rate of bilateral fusion was 25.0% and 20% in the third and sixth months, respectively. The results of computed tomography scans performed at six months after surgery indicated, according to the criteria of Glassman, a rate of bilateral solid fusion of 15.0% and 10.0% in groups I and II, respectively. The use of PRP showed no significant difference in bone healing in cases of lumbar arthrodesis.
