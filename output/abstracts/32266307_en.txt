Secondary sclerosing cholangitis in critically ill patients (SSC-CIP) is a recently identified cholestatic liver disease occurring in patients without prior history of hepatobiliary disease, after receiving treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU) in different settings, including cardiothoracic surgery, infection, trauma, and burns. It is a rare entity, being estimated to occur in 1/2,000 patients in an ICU; however, it is a dismal condition, with up to half of the patients dying during the ICU stay and with rapid progression to liver cirrhosis over weeks to months. SSC-CIP should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cholestasis in the ICU, particularly when cholestasis persists after recovery from the critical event. Diagnosis is established with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography showing dilations and stenoses of the intrahepatic bile ducts as well as biliary casts. No available treatment has been shown to slow the rapid progression of the disease, and liver transplant referral should be considered early after the diagnosis of SSC-CIP. Increased awareness and timely diagnosis are crucial in order to improve the current appalling outcome.
