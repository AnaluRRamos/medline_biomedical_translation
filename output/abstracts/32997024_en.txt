Given the extensive costs due to cardiovascular diseases and the increased prevalence of these diseases in farmers, this study aims to estimate the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in this population and to evaluate their associated factors. A cross-sectional study was carried out involving 790 farmers from the municipality of Santa Maria de Jetib√°-ES, Brazil. Six out of ten evaluated farmers had at least one cardiovascular risk factor (CRF). High blood pressure was the most prevalent risk factor in 35.8% (95%CI 32-39, n = 283) followed by dyslipidemia (34.4%, 95%CI 31-38, n = 272). Those aged more than 50 years were 5.6 times (95%CI 2.03-15.43) more likely to evidence two or more CRFs. High waist circumference or tricipital skinfold indicating overweight increased 2.35 times (95%CI 1.47-3.76) and 1.6 times (95%CI 1.05-2.44) this likelihood, respectively. These findings reveal the high prevalence of CRF in rural workers and the significant impact of age and the accumulation of body fat in the development of these factors, showing the need to intensify public health policies geared to this population.
