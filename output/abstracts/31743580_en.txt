In this work, samples of Fe mining tailings from the collapsed Fundão Dam, Brazil, which were retained by the Candonga hydroelectric power plant, were characterized by various techniques. Quartz, hematite, kaolinite, and goethite were identified as the main phases present. The composition, homogeneity, and relatively low (~1%) organic matter content indicate potential for usage of these tailings in civil constructions. The next step of this work is to investigate such applications. If their feasibility is confirmed, the goal is to use this material for construction in the areas affected by the Fundão Dam rupture. This use will lead to positive socio-environmental impacts in these regions, where tailings still need to be removed and damaged infrastructure needs to be repaired.
