To analyze 10 consecutive cases of microsurgical arteriovenous loops created to reconstruct complex injuries from March 2011 to May 2012. This observational cohort-type study conducted by the Hand and Microsurgery Group at the HC-FMUSP included patients who were candidates for microsurgical reconstruction as a last alternative to amputation of the limb with proven absence of adequate recipient vessels for primary microsurgical anastomosis, in a prospective and consecutive manner. We analyzed 14 variables (epidemiological, clinical, procedure-related, and outcome) in patients who underwent reconstruction using an arteriovenous loop utilizing a single-stage or two-stage procedure. The injuries were mostly traumatic (80%). The success rate of the single-stage procedure was 75%, and 17% for the two-stage procedure. The rate of preservation for the injured limb was 44%. This study reinforces the more recent understanding that the indication for single-stage or two-stage reconstruction should be individualized; our findings favor the single-stage reconstruction. This technique should be used in selected cases, as a last reconstructive alternative before amputation, and further studies are necessary to confirm its safety and efficacy in our practice. Level of Evidence IV; Case series.
