Rubella is a vaccine preventable infection, and congenital rubella the most feared complication of this disease. Although young adult women are at greatest risk of post-vaccine rubella, this is also the group who potentially benefits the most from vaccine protection. Since post-vaccine disease has a mild and self-limited course, the benefit clearly exceeds the risk. During a measles outbreak in the north of Portugal, a 38-year-old woman presented with cervical posterior lymphadenopathies, fever and a maculo-papular rash one week after the administration of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. Measles was discarded and rubella viremia was demonstrated. Symptoms of rubella are non-specific and laboratory confirmation is essential. This is particularly relevant during a measles outbreak.
