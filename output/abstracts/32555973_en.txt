to investigate factors associated with glycemic control in individuals with diabetes mellitus (DM). this was a cross-sectional study, with participants in the Longitudinal Study of Adult Health with self-reported DM; binomial logistic regression was used. 1,242 individuals were included; 54.2% had glycated hemoglobin â‰¥6.5%, showing inadequate glycemic control; factors associated with inadequate glycemic control were male sex (OR=1.39 - 95%CI 1.05;1.85), black skin color (OR=1.74 - 95%CI 1.22;2.48) or brown skin color (OR=1,57 - 95%CI 1.14;2.16), average occupation level (OR=1.63 - 95%CI 1.02;2.58), not having health insurance (OR=1.47 - 95%CI 1.09;1.96), use of insulin (OR=7.34 - 95%CI 3.56;15.15), increased waist-to-hip ratio (OR=1.87 - 95%CI 1.19;2.93), smoking (OR=1.73 - 95%CI 1.09;2.74), and poor or very poor self-rated health (OR=2.37 - 95%CI 1.17;4.83). the results reinforce the multicausal context in glycemic control, which was associated with sociodemographic factors, lifestyles and health conditions.
