This study aimed to assess characteristics of healthcare networks in four large Brazilian cities (Campinas, Fortaleza, Porto Alegre, and S達o Paulo), in the provision of mental healthcare. The following outcomes were used: (i) place of identification of the mental health problem; (ii) mental healthcare in primary care; (iii) pharmaceutical care in mental health; and (iv) social rehabilitation. This is a mixed-methods study with a concurrent and sequential approach, conducted with 10 administrators and 1,642 users of Centers for Psychosocial Care (CAPS, in Portuguese) in the four cities. The study showed the persistence of high-complexity services such as hospitals as the site for initial identification of mental health problems in Campinas (40% of users) and Fortaleza (37%); low proportion of mental health treatment in primary care (Fortaleza, 23%); differences between cities in psychotropic medication prescription in primary care (Porto Alegre, 68%; S達o Paulo, 64%; Campinas, 39%; Fortaleza, 31%) and in shortages of prescribed medication (higher in Fortaleza, 58%; lower in Campinas, 28%); and overall frailty in enabling return to work (lower in S達o Paulo, 17%; higher in Campinas, 39%), with better overall results regarding religion and leisure activities (higher in S達o Paulo, 53% and 56%, respectively). The study contributes to the discussion of the Brazilian scenario of mental healthcare, with evidence of persistent inequalities in the national context, pointing to gaps in some mental healthcare network configurations with the potential for better performance and longitudinal follow-up.
