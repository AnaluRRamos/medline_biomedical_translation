Physical activity is a complex behavior influenced by sociodemographic and clinical factors. A better understanding of the relationships between these factors is essential to better understanding their influence on physical activity. The objective of this study was to examine the association between socioeconomic status, age, body fat, and depressive symptoms and level of physical activity among adults. We conducted a cross-sectional population-based study with 808 individuals to examine the interrelations between the above factors and their influence on level of physical activity using path analysis. Age had a significant direct negative effect on level of physical activity (β = -0.113, p < 0.004) and a significant positive effect on body fat (β = 0.376, p < 0.001). Depressive symptoms were negatively influenced by socioeconomic status (β = -0.126, p < 0.001) and positively influenced by age (β = 0.244, p < 0.001) and body fat (β = 0.169; p < 0.004). Socioeconomic status, body fat and depressive symptoms did not directly influence level of physical activity. This study concludes that level of physical activity declines with advancing age.
