This study aimed to analyze factors associated with vaccination of municipal health workers in Bahia State, Brazil. This was a cross-sectional study from 2010 and 2012 with 3,084 workers in primary and medium-complexity care. The following indicators were described: prevalence of vaccination in the adult calendar according to the Brazilian National Immunization Program (PNI) and the completeness of vaccination regimens according to sociodemographic, economic, work, domestic overload, psychosocial, satisfaction and social support at work, occupational, life habits, health status, and self-rated health variables. Multivariate analysis was performed to assess the joint effect of the study variables. Only 38.5% of the workers reported complete vaccinal status for all the vaccines in the adult calendar. Completeness of the vaccination card showed a positive association with: female gender (95%CI: 1.42-2.10), working directly in patient care (95%CI: 1.26-1.71), having technical resources for the development of the professional activities (95%CI: 1.02-1.34), social support at work (95%CI: 1.02-1.26), contact with biological material (95%CI: 1.39-1.75), preparation of medications (95%CI: 1.10-1.44), and positive self-rated health (95%CI: 1.03-1.41). Factors such as sociodemographic conditions and occupational exposure have an influence on vaccination. Given the resurgence of immune-preventable diseases, it is necessary to monitor health workers' vaccinal status. The phenomenon should be analyzed according to its complexity, focusing on aspects related to resistance that extrapolate the issues usually measured and allow the investigation of beliefs attributed to vaccines.
