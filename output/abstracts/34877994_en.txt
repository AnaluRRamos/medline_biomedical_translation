Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) or kala azar is one of the main neglected tropical diseases, of major importance due to the lethal nature of this zoonosis caused by protozoa of genus Leishmania. The study aimed to analyze the time trend in VL cases in the state of Piauí, Brazil, from 2008 to 2018, within the total period from 1971 to 2018. Data were obtained from the Brazilian Information System for Notificable Diseases (SINAN) and the Brazilian Mortality Information System (SIM). For burden of disease analysis, data were collected from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation through the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD Compare). Prais-Winsten regression analysis was used. A total of 2,374 cases were recorded with probable infection in the state of Piauí and 2,492 cases in residents of the state. The historical series analyzed, from 1971 to 2018, reaffirms the cyclical nature of the disease, based on the identification of epidemic peaks in 1983-1984, 1993-1994, 2003-2004, and 2013-2014. No significant alterations were identified in the trends in incidence, mortality, and case-fatality coefficients in the state. However, there was a significant increase in the incidence coefficient in the Chapada das Mangabeiras Development Territory, with an annual percent change of 17.5%, and a decrease in the Vale do Sambito Development Territory (-18.3%) and Vale do Rio Guaribas Development Territory (-8,1%). VL has a high burden of disease, measured by disability-adjusted life years, and is among the leading neglected tropical diseases in the state of Piauí. The study concludes by recommending the improvement of surveillance and control measures for this disease.
