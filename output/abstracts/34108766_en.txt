The cranial nerves, which represent extensions of the functional structures of the brain, traverse the head and neck. They are connected to various cranial structures and are associated with several diseases. An in-depth understanding of their complex anatomy and normal imaging appearance allows the examiner to identify and characterize abnormalities with greater precision. One important tool for evaluating the cranial nerves is contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, especially three-dimensional steady-state free precession sequences, which provide high soft-tissue and spatial resolution, despite the slenderness of the nerves. In most cases, imaging findings are nonspecific. Therefore, to narrow the differential diagnosis, it is necessary to take a full patient anamnesis, perform a focused physical examination and order laboratory tests. In this pictorial essay we review, illustrate and discuss, from a pathophysiological perspective, congenital, traumatic, and vascular diseases of the cranial nerves.
