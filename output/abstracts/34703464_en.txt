The objective of this study was to estimate trends in alcohol per capita consumption from 1990 to 2016 in the Region of the Americas, covering 35 Member States. Data from the WHO Global Information System on Alcohol and Health were used to calculate the annual percent change of alcohol per capita consumption in each of the 35 countries of the Americas. The Americas as a whole showed no change in the total period, with a slight decrease in the period 2010-2016. From 1990 to 2016, all the countries that presented a trend of annual increase in annual percent change of alcohol per capita consumption were in the Caribbean and Central America. Large increases were found in the recent years in Cuba, Colombia, Uruguay, El Salvador, and several countries of the Non-Latin Caribbean. In conclusion, alcohol use remains a significant obstacle to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 3.5. To date, the policy response has been inadequate in protecting the people in the Americas from alcohol-attributable harms. Improving country capacity to collect and analyze data on alcohol per capita consumption is urgently needed to monitor progress on the Sustainable Development Goals and to serve to promote proven alcohol policies for reducing the harmful use of alcohol.
