To prospectively, clinically and functionally follow-up patients previously diagnosed with lateral epicondylitis after periarticular application of hyaluronic acid and analyze the results. All patients were previously treated conservatively and had no clinical improvement. Data such as age, positivity for specific tests (Cozen and Mill), visual analogue pain scale (VAS) before and during dorsiflexion of the wrist with resistance, diagnosis time, Mayo Elbow Performance Score was collected. Patients were reevaluated 30 and 90 days after application. The positivity rates for Cozen and Mill tests were identical, starting at 100%, dropping to 50% after one month, and ending at 41.7% after 3 months. The initial Mayo Elbow Score average was 61.3 points; 85.8 in the first month, remaining at 85 in the third month. VAS in active force situations had the initial average of 8.1; after one month it dropped to 3.8, and 3.6 after three months. At rest, the initial average was 5.9; after one month it decreased to 3 and ended at 2.1 in three months. Patients showed improvement in pain parameters, in the Mayo Elbow Performance Score standard, but with 25% of failure in satisfaction. <b>Level of evidence IV, Case series</b>.
