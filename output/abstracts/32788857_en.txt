To evaluate if the levels of serum total protein and serum albumin are risk factors for surgical complications of free flap limb reconstruction. Consecutive inclusion of all patients undergoing microsurgical flaps for limb reconstruction of complex injuries. We recorded epidemiological and laboratory data, including total proteins and fractions, for descriptive and analytical statistics. Our study analyzed one microsurgical flap from 35 patients that underwent complex injuries of the limbs. In total, 23 patients were men, and mean age of all patients was 35 years. After statistical analysis, no influence of pre or postoperative hypoalbuminemia was observed on the incidence of complications. Patients with hypoalbuminemia had a higher length of stay than those with normal albumin levels (p = 0.008). We observed that 71% of patients had hypoalbuminemia in early postoperative period and we suggest a nutritional support for patients requiring complex traumatic limb reconstruction. Hypoalbuminemia in patients subjected to microsurgical flaps for the treatment of complex traumatic limb injuries did not influence the complications that required surgical reintervention; However, it was associated with prolonged hospital stay. <b>Level of Evidence II, Retrospective study</b>.
