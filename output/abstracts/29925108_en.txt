Parvovirus B19 has tropism for red line blood cells, causing immune hydrops during pregnancy. A positive anti-Kell Coombs reaction usually happens during pregnancy when there is production of antibodies that target Kell antigens, but cross reactions to other antigens may occur. A 24-year-old Gypsy primigravida, 0 Rhesus positive, presented with persistent isolated hyperthermia for 2 weeks and a positive indirect Coombs test result with anti-Kell antibodies at routine tests. She had a 19-week live fetus. The blood tests revealed bicytopenia with iron deficiency anemia, leucopoenia with neutropenia, and elevated C-reactive protein. She was medicated with imipenem, and had a slow clinical recovery. Blood, urine and sputum samples were taken to perform cultures and to exclude other systemic infections. <i>Escherichia coli</i> was isolated in the urine, which most probably caused a transient cross anti-Kell reaction. <i>Haemophilus influenza</i> in the sputum and seroconversion to parvovirus B19 was confirmed, causing unusual deficits in the white cells, culminating in febrile neutropenia. Despite the patient's lack of compliance to the medical care, both maternal and fetal/neonatal outcomes were good. This a rare case report of 2 rare phenomena, a cross anti-Kell reaction to <i>E. coli</i> and parvovirus B19 infection with tropism for white cells causing febrile neutropenia, both events occurring simultaneously during pregnancy.
