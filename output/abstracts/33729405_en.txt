Pelvic Inflammatory Disease is a topic included in the Clinical Protocol and Therapeutic Guidelines for Comprehensive Care for People with Sexually Transmitted Infections, published by the Brazilian Ministry of Health in 2020. Pelvic inflammatory disease is an acute infection of the upper female genital tract due to canalicular spread of endogenous cervicovaginal microorganisms, in particular sexually transmitted organisms. Standing out among the etiological agents involved are Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The most important sequels are chronic pelvic pain, infertility and ectopic pregnancy. Clinical diagnosis is the most important practical approach. Antibiotic treatment should start immediately upon clinical suspicion. The article contains guidance for health service managers and health professionals on diagnostic tests, treatment, follow-up, counseling, notification, handling of sexual partnerships and special populations. In view of increased availability of the molecular biology technique in Brazil, C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae screening is recommended as a disease prevention strategy.
