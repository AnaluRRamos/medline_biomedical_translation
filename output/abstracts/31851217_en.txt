Describe the implementation process of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) in a Specialized Rehabilitation Center based on the biopsychosocial approach to health. This is a descriptive, analytical, longitudinal study. The ICF implementation process in the healthcare center encompassed four stages: a) training on the use of the ICF; b) preparation of checklists by the team; c) collection of relevant data based on the checklist from the healthcare center users; and d) construction of a database. A checklist was constructed for each sector involved, and the database included user information and the ICF results during evaluation and reevaluation. The findings indicate higher problem-solving capacity in all sectors throughout the study period, and that training was crucial to operationalize the ICF. Preparation of the instruments based on the reality of the healthcare center was essential to meet local demands and those of each sector. The ICF enabled greater practice of the biopsychosocial approach based on the engagement of the professionals in its operationalization, with evidence of healthcare problem-solving capacity and visibility and organization of the work process.
