VCI represents a spectrum of cognitive impairments associated with stroke, vascular brain injury, or subclinical disease ranging from the least to most severe manifestations. Few studies are available on the prevalence of post-stroke VCI and none have been conducted in Brazil. To determine the prevalence rates of VCI and associated risk factors in a sample of ischemic stroke patients. We evaluated 172 patients with ischemic stroke for cognitive impairment one year after ictus. Patients comprised 81 women (47.1%) and had a mean age of 67.77 (7.86) years, schooling of 3.52 (2.99) years, and MMSE score of 24.94 (3.59) points. After cognitive evaluation, 4.6% were diagnosed as CIND (cognitive impairment no dementia) and 12.2% had a diagnosis of dementia (probable vascular dementia in 20 patients and one subject with cerebrovascular disease and Alzheimer's disease). The prevalence of dementia was lower than previous reports but our sample had a lower age than others, while a 12 month-period of follow-up prevented interference from associated neurodegenerative disorders.
