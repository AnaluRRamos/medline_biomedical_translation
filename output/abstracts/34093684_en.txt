External iliac artery endofibrosis is a rare pathology that affects high-level endurance athletes, especially cyclists. Classical symptoms include pain, loss of power, and/or cramp in the affected limb while training at maximal effort. The patient's lack of atherosclerotic risk factors makes clinical suspicion of arteriopathy challenging. Moreover, the best management of such patients is still a subject of discussion. We report the case of a 36-year-old professional female endurance cyclist who presented with lower extremity pain during training. Right external iliac artery endofibrosis was diagnosed and the patient underwent surgical treatment. At two-months follow-up, she reported significant improvement in symptoms. This case highlights the importance of diagnosing peripheral vascular disease in young patients and athletes, who do not fit the ordinary profile of patients with atherosclerotic risk factors.
