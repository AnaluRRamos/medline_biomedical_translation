This study evaluated factors associated with the consumption of breast milk (BM), infant formula (IF) and cow milk (CM) in children. This was a cohort study with 256 children followed-up at the 1st, 4th and 6th month of age in Vi√ßosa (MG), Brazil. With respect to CM and IF, consumption was recorded regardless of BM intake. Regarding BM, only exclusive or predominant consumption was considered. From the 1st to the 6th month, an increase was recorded in the number of children who did not consume BM exclusively or predominantly (31.6%), as well as the consumption of CM (27.2%) and IF (9.3%). BM was associated with pacifier use at 1st month, and mother's employment status and pacifier use in the 4th and 6th month. Pacifier use was a risk factor for IF consumption in every month, while belonging to the lower income group was inversely associated in the 6th month. As for CM, the number of prenatal visits was a risk factor in every month, the mother's employment status and use of pacifier in the 4th month, family income, mother's employment status, low birth weight, number of prenatal visits and pacifier use in the 6th month. Since the 1st month, the introduction of other milk types is high, revealing that there is still much to go to ensure exclusive breastfeeding up to 6 months.
