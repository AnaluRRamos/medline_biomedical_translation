Monoclonal antibodies (mABs) have been indicated as an innovative technology for the treatment of some types of cancer, since they are capable of targeting and selectively killing tumor cells. However, the high costs of these therapies raise questions as to the sustainability of access. This study aimed to identify the principal characteristics of monoclonal antibodies used in cancer treatment with active marketing authorization in Brazil as of 2016. This was a descriptive retrospective analysis based on consultation of the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (Anvisa) website, in which these mABs were characterized according to the target antigen, type of antibody, year of registration, therapeutic indications, and applicant. A total of 14 antibodies were identified with action on seven different target antigens. The most frequent clinical indications were for lymphomas, leukemias, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer. As for type, the study identified three chimeric, six humanized, and five human antibodies. Roche was the applicant in 6 of the 14 mABs, or 43% of the marketing authorization. It was possible to discuss the idea of me-too medicines in the biological market and the idea of a differentiated oligopoly, as well as to think about the tensions in this kind of market. It is expected that the development of new products, although to act on the same biological target, represent the possibility of a competitive increase and, as a result, a decrease in prices practiced by companies. However, this becomes a problem when it is the same pharmaceutical industry that launches on the market new antibodies directed to the same target, with no relevant changes.
