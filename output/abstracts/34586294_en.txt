To analyze the olfactory and gustatory perception and discrimination and self-perception of smell and taste in people with Parkinson's disease, comparing them with healthy nodes. Observational, analytical, cross-sectional, and quantitative study. Olfactory and gustatory perception and discrimination were verified following Parkinson's disease, compared to a control group, matched by sex and age, using the Olfactory Perception and Taste Strips Tests, respectively, after nasal cleaning and oral brushing. Self-perception was assessed by the Visual Analogue Scale before and after specific tests of perception and discrimination. We included individuals of both sexes, 35 with Parkinson's Disease and 20 assigned to the control group, matched for mean age. The olfactory self-perception of the group with Parkinson's disease improved after the olfactory test. There was no difference in taste self-perception in the Parkinson's disease group before and after the taste test. In the olfactory perception assessment test, the Parkinson's disease group discriminated fewer essences than the control group. Both groups have similar generation and taste discrimination. The olfactory perception of people with Parkinson's disease was lower, compared to the group of healthy desires, and the self-perception of olfactory efficacy improved after the test, in both groups. As for taste, there was no difference in perception and discrimination between groups, the sour taste was the most identified and there was an improvement in self-perception of taste efficiency in the group without Parkinson's disease after the test.
