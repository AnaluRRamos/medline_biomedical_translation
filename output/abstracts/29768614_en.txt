The scope of this study was to investigate the prevalence and factors associated with negative self-rated health in menopausal women registered with the Family Health Strategy in a Brazilian urban center. It is a cross-sectional study with a random sample of menopausal women. A validated instrument addressing sociodemographic and behavioral data related to self-rated health status was used. The association between the variables studied and negative self-rated health was assessed by bivariate analysis followed by Poisson regression with robust variance, in a hierarchical model. The prevalence of negative self-rated health among the population studied was 41.6%, among 761 women. Among women aged 52-65 years old, 49.2% had negative self-rated health. Age corresponding to post-menopause, education up to eight years of study, having a partner, not having a formal job, current tobacco use and physical inactivity were associated with negative self-rated health. The presence of menopausal symptoms, overweight and obesity, the current use of medication and the presence of chronic diseases were also associated with negative self-rated health in the final model. The associations observed point to the need for health promotion activities aimed at menopausal women.
