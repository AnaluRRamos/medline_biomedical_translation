The aim of this study was to assess the results of percutaneous injection of autologous bone marrow in the treatment of fractures presenting with delayed union or non-union after internal fixation. This prospective study was carried out at the Orthopeedics Department from June 2005 to June 2010. A total of 93 patients with delayed union and non-union (56 delayed unions and 37 non-unions) of the long bone were recruited from the Emergency and Outpatient Departments and treated with percutaneous autologous bone marrow injections. The clinical results of this study were rated on the basis of the criteria of union. All patients were followed for 24 months. All the fractures (delayed union and non-union) were united within 12 weeks. Most of the patients had discomfort at the donor site for few days; none had problems of persistent pain. The results were excellent in 68.81% (64/93) of cases, good in 19.35% (18/93) of cases, and poor in 11.82% (11/93) of cases. Percutaneous autologous bone marrow injection is an effective and safe method for the treatment of diaphyseal non-union and delayed union. Thus, it is concluded that with an adequate amount of autologous bone marrow injection, successful union in delayed union and non-union of fractures of long bones can be achieved.
