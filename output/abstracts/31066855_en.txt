Breast cancer is a public health problem due to its high incidence, morbidity and mortality. The analysis of survival for this disease contributes to the description of behavior and prognostic factors. The scope of this article is to investigate survival for 10 years after diagnosis and the prognostic factors of women with breast cancer admitted to the Unified Health System Mastology Service in Joinville, State of Santa Catarina, between 2000 and 2014. A historical cohort study with data from the medical records and death certificates of 1,321 women, of whom 471 were considered eligible under the minimum follow-up criteria of 10 years (n = 288), and/or death before this period (n = 183). Survival analysis using the Kaplan-Meier model, the Log-Rank test and the Cox regression model was conducted. Overall survival at 10 years was 41% (CI 95%, 36.1%-45.0%). The risk of 10-year mortality stratified by tumor staging was higher among women with lymphatic invasion and staging II, and staging III, at 60 years or older. The findings suggest that the presence of lymphatic invasion, advanced age and intermediate/advanced staging of the disease can be considered indicators of a worse prognosis for breast cancer.
