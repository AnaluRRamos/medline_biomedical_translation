This study aims to identify the factors that hinder physically disabled children and adolescent's access to physiotherapy in establishments accredited by the Unified Health System in Curitiba, Paran√°, Brazil. This is a cross-sectional study that interviewed managers, physiotherapists, parents or guardians of children with physical disabilities. The perception of difficulties of each interviewed group was compared through descriptive statistics, considering the following realms: availability, purchasing power, information and acceptability. Considering the realm of availability, we identified the following hindrances: distance between the physiotherapy location and user's residence, inadequate supply of services and waiting list. Regarding the purchasing power, we observed the lack of financial resources among parents. Regarding information and acceptability, the lack of information about diagnosis and denial were reported by participants. We can conclude that the physiotherapy service has not been timely assured to children's motor development, so it is necessary to review the organization and distribution of services, and effective policies are required to ensure their use.
