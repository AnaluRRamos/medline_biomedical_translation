In this research note, I present a preliminary account of doctoral research in women's and children's health at the Instituto Nacional de Saúde da Mulher, da Criança e do Adolescente Fernandes Figueira/Fiocruz. The aim is to study the spread of knowledge and practices relating to childbirth by analyzing obstetrics handbooks published in Brazil between 1980 and 2011, contributing to the development of childbirth care in which the woman and her needs are at the center of the decision-making process about which care, interventions, and procedures are to be dispensed during labor and childbirth.
