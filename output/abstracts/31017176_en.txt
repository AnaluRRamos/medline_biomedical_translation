Avoiding deaths in the waiting list for an organ is no longer the only focus of the transplant teams attention. Research and care in clinical practice has been increasingly focused on post transplant graft survival and functioning. In the present work, we performed an integrative literature review to identify the terminology used about liver graft dysfunction and non-function, as well as to investigate the incidence and risk factors of these clinical events. We chosen articles written in Portuguese, English and Spanish between 2012 and 2016, based on CINAHL, MEDLINE, Cochrane, LILACS, BDENF, IBECS, EMBASE and Web of Science. We selected 14 studies, in which we identified the incidence of hepatic graft dysfunction ranging from 7% to 27%. The terminology used to describe this clinical event was initial malfunction, graft hypofunction, marginal function or delay in function. The primary non-function of the liver graft was found in 1.4% to 8.4% of the patients, and the terminology used to describe the event was early dysfunction or graft loss. The risk factors found are related to donor, recipient, graft and transplant logistics variables. We conclude that knowledge of the different terminologies employed in the literature, related to dysfunction and primary non- function incidence, and of their risk factors are fundamental to qualify the control of the events, aiming to improve patients' survival after liver transplantation.
