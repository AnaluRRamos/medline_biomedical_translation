The present study aimed to report the results of the first series of cases of fresh ostechondral allografts in the knee joint in Brazil with a minimum follow-up of two years. A protocol of procurement, harvesting, processing, and utilization of fresh osteochondral allografts in the knee joint was established, beginning with legislation modifications, graft harvesting techniques, immediate processing, storage of fresh grafts, and utilization of two surgical techniques of osteochondral transplantation. Eight patients were treated and followed-up for a minimum of two years. Patients were evaluated with subjective IKDC, KOOS, and modified Merle D'Aubigne and Postel questionnaires. Mean subjective IKDC score was 31.99 ± 13.4 preoperative and 81.26 ± 14.7 at the latest follow-up; preoperative KOOS score was 46.8 ± 20.9 and postoperative was 85.24 ± 13.9, indicating a significant improvement over time (<i>p</i> < 0.01). Mean modified Merle D'Aubigne-Postel score was 8.75 ± 2.25, preoperatively, and 16.1 ± 2.59 postoperatively. Friedman test for non-parametric samples demonstrated a significant improvement in postoperative scores (<i>p</i> < 0.01). The use of fresh osteochondral allografts in Brazil is a safe procedure, with good clinical results in the short- and medium-term for the treatment of osteochondral lesions greater than 4 cm<sup>2</sup> in the knee joint.
