To correlate clinical and intraoperative findings with the postoperative evaluation of two-stage bicruciate knee ligament reconstruction. The study was conducted with 25 patients (20 men and 05 women) with mean age of 32.3 years, mean body mass index (BMI) of 26.2, and mean lesion duration of 18.3 months. The treatment consisted of an Inlay reconstruction of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) followed by the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, at least 3 months after the first surgical procedure. Four patients required additional procedures: patellar tendon (02), medial collateral ligament (MCL) (02). With an average follow-up of 24.8 months, 60% of the patients scored zero or + at the posterior drawer test, while 40% scored ++; 60% of patients were evaluated as good/excellent according to the Lysholm scale. Only one patient reached the pre-injury Tegner activity level. Injury duration had a negative influence on functional limitation, vitality, and mental health (SF-36). Although two-stage bicruciate knee ligament reconstruction improved knee stability and self-assessment, 96% of patients did not recover their pre-injury state. In the 36-item short form survey (SF-36), injury duration was inversely correlated with self-assessment of functional capacity, physical limitation, vitality, and mental health. <i>Level of Evidence II, retrospective study</i>.
