This study aimed to identify the factors associated with condom use in the last sexual intercourse. A population-based survey with young people aged 15-24, in the city of São Paulo, which collected sociodemographic data referring to knowledge about sex and sexual behavior. Among 821 sexually active young people interviewed in the last year, condom use in their last sexual intercourse was positively associated with: 1) not being married; 2) use of condom at sexual onset; and 3) receiving free condoms; additionally, among men: 4) casual partners in the previous year; and 5) partner of the same sex; and, amongwomen: 6) sexual onset after the age of 15. Having been tested for HIV was a negative association among women. Condoms are widely acknowledged, and there is a pattern of use for the first and last sexual intercourse. Access to free condoms is an important factor for use, and people use condoms according to standards that configure risk management. The strategy of primary prevention with the use of condoms is not yet exhausted. Based on this study, the city of São Paulo takes prevention as a public policy and allocates large condoms dispensers in 26 urban bus terminals, where 6million people circulate daily. In 2016, 75,546,720 free condoms were distributed, 30% in bus terminals alone.
