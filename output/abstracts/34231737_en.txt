In 2015, there was an epidemic of microcephaly in Brazil that was associated with infection by the Zika virus. The condition of these children obliged the parents to embark on a quest in search of treatment. The scope of this study was to establish the therapeutic itinerary pursued in healthcare sectors by parents and/or caregivers of children with microcephaly due to the Zika virus. It involved qualitative research, conducted at a Center of Reference on Neurodevelopment between April 2017 and February 2018, with parents and/or caregivers of children with microcephaly caused by the Zika virus. The sample complied with the criteria of saturation. Twenty semi-structured interviews were conducted, recorded, and transcribed, and content analysis was applied. The results revealed disorientation and uncertainties in the search for care in the health sector. The most sought-after sector was the professional sector, followed by the informal sector. The information conveyed in the media and social networks, which constitute part of the informal sector, helped to clarify the significance of microcephaly and the Zika virus and assisted in the search for treatment. Care in the healthcare network was marked by difficulties and, faced with a new and emergency situation, the route between diagnosis and treatment was arduous.
