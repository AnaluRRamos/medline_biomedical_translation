To establish international expert recommendations on clinical features to prompt referral for diagnostic assessment of cerebral palsy (CP). An online Delphi survey was conducted with international experts in early identification and intervention for children with CP, to validate the results obtained in two previous consensus groups with Canadian content experts and knowledge users. We sent two rounds of questionnaires by e-mail. Participants rated their agreement using a 4-point Likert scale, along with optional open-ended questions for additional feedback. Additionally, a panel of experts and knowledge-users reviewed the results of each round and determined the content of subsequent surveys. Overall, there was high-level of agreement on: (1) six clinical features that should prompt referral for diagnosis; (2) two 'warning sign' features that warrant monitoring rather than immediate referral for diagnosis; and (3) five referral recommendations to other healthcare professionals to occur simultaneously with referral for diagnosis. There was high agreement among international experts, suggesting that the features and referral recommendations proposed for primary care physicians for early detection of CP were broadly generalizable. These results will inform the content of educational tools to improve the early detection of CP in the primary care context. International experts provide strong agreement on clinical features to detect cerebral palsy. Consensus on clinical 'warning signs' to monitor over time. Referral recommendations from primary care to specialized health services are identified.
