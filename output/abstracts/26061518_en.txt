Multiple complications can occur in tuberculosis. Bronchopleurocutaneous fistula is a pathological communication between bronchus, pleural space and skin. We present a 47 year-old male patient, schizophrenic, who presented with complaints of pleuritic chest pain, cough and weight loss. The patient was cachectic with purulent drainage from an orifice in the antero-lateral left chest wall. In this drainage acid-fast bacilli were identified and chest radiograph showed bilateral infiltrates. He was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Department with the diagnosis of fistulized pulmonary tuberculosis, confirmed by visualization of acid-fast bacilli, positive polymerase chain reaction and cultures for Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the sputum. The patient was started on quadruple antituberculosis therapy and had a favorable outcome. Bronchopleurocutaneous fistula is a rare complication of pulmonary tuberculosis. Despite pulmonary tuberculosis being a common condition in our country, the rarity of this complication prompted the authors to present it.
