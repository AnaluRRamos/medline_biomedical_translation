Dementia is a general term for a heterogeneous group of organic neurodegenerative diseases. Cerebrovascular causes account for 20% of cases. To describe the clinical and epidemiological features of individuals aged >60 years diagnosed with vascular dementia (VD) or mixed dementia (MxD) in a referral hospital for dementia. A descriptive, retrospective study was carried out from 2014 to 2017 involving elderly individuals (â‰¥60 years) with VA or MxD. Patients presenting other forms of dementia or in use of medication that mimics cognitive disorders were excluded. The 12-item Neuropsychiatric Inventory was used to assess neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS). 81.1% of the patients presented NPS and only 15% had two or more symptoms. Apathy was the most frequent NPS (56.6%). There was an association between CDR score 1 or 2 and NPS (OR = 6.16, 95% CI: 1.36-27.9, p = 0.02). Most patients had a single symptom, predominantly apathy. There was an association between mild-to-moderate dementia and NPS.
