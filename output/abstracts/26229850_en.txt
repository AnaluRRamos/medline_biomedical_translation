To determine whether the clinical variables and preoperative classification of patients with Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease (LCPD) who undergo Salter osteotomy correlate with the radiographic result at the time of skeletal maturity. In this retrospective cohort study, 47 individuals with LCPD who were treated using Salter osteotomy (1984-2004) were evaluated. The patients were evaluated according to sex, skin color, side affected and age at which osteotomy was performed. The preoperative radiographs were analyzed in accordance with the classifications of Waldenström, Catterall, Laredo and Herring. The radiographs obtained at the time of skeletal maturity were classified using the Stulberg method. The mean age at the time of surgical treatment was 82.87 months (6.9 years). The age presented a statistically significant correlation with the Stulberg grades at skeletal maturity (p < 0.001). Patients over the age of 6.12 years tended to present less favorable results. The variables of sex, skin color and side affected did not present any statistically significant correlation with the prognosis (p = 0.425; p = 0.467; p = 0.551, respectively). Only the Laredo classification presented a statistically significant correlation with the final result given by the Stulberg classification (p = 0.001). The other classifications used (Waldenström, Catterall and Herring) did not present any correlation between the time at which surgery was indicated and the postoperative result. The age at which the patients underwent surgical treatment and the Laredo classification groups were the only variables that presented significant correlations with the Stulberg classification.
