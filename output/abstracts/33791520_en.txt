The study of sexual differences provides insights into selective factors operating on males and females, especially for clades exhibiting varied levels of dimorphism. Sexual differences in morphology and coloration (melanophores) were compiled for 66 of the 89 species of tube blennies (Blenniiformes, Chaenopsidae) from the systematic literature and examination of preserved specimens. Chaenopsids include essentially monomorphic species and those in which males and females differ in as many as 17 morphological and 14 coloration features. While the sexes of most species differ in coloration (at least at the time of breeding), they are morphologically similar in <i>Acanthemblemaria</i>, <i>Hemiemblemaria</i>, and <i>Lucayablennius</i>. While other genera exhibit an intermediate level of dimorphism, species of <i>Coralliozetus</i>, <i>Cirriemblemaria</i>, and <i>Emblemaria</i> are dramatically dimorphic. Character maps on a phylogenetic hypothesis indicate that this extreme level of dimorphism evolved independently in these genera. A complex history of evolution is implied by examination of jaw length with both increases and decreases in one or both sexes leading to either dimorphism or monomorphism. Several features related to shelter defense are monomorphic in species where both sexes inhabit shelters, but dimorphic where only males occupy shelters. Other dimorphic features increase the conspicuousness of male courtship and aggressive displays.
