In 1868, Darwin published his book The variation of animals and plants under domestication, which laid out his theory of heredity. This included the assumption that development was essential to understanding the evolutionary process. This present article reassesses the Darwinian theory of pangenesis in order to revisit its historical value. The conclusion is that the theory of pangenesis was well-suited to its time, and additionally, reflections of this assumption can be found in work in new areas known as evolutionary biology of development (evo-devo) and epigenetics.
