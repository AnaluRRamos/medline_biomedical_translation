Minimally invasive revascularization of the left anterior descending coronary artery has gained popularity. Recently, the emergence of new surgical instruments and the improvement of the technique, allowed its use by routine. Its use in Heart Team allows excellent results. Our aim is to present the results of patients undergoing this technique in our center. Retrospective study of patients submitted to minimally invasive revascularization of the left anterior descending coronary artery at our center. We identified 14 patients. The mean age was 67 years old. In the total of the procedures, 79% were elective and 21% urgent. The ventricular function was preserved in 86% of the patients. In the preoperative catheterization, 64% of the patients showed single disease of the anterior descending coronary artery, 29% had trunk lesions and 3 vessels and 7% had lesion of 2 vessels. The mean Euroscore II was 4.8%. The mean time of surgery was 103 minutes with a mean blood loss of 250mL. The main complications were wound dehiscence and revision of hemostasis. The mean hospitalization rate was 6.2 days. The hospital survival rate was 100%. Minimally invasive revascularization allows coronary artery bypass grafting with the best conduit. Revascularization may be total in single disease of the left anterior descending artery, or in case of multivessel disease, achieved with hibrid revascularization, with angioplasty of the remaining vessels. This technique has shown to be promising and safe, being the discussion in Heart Team of the patient candidates essential for achieving the best results.
