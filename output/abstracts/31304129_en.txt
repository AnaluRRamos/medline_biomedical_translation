A comparative analysis by applying the criteria of the original classification Ahlbäck in the anteroposterior (AP) bipedal knee in extension and anteroposterior (AP) monopodal knee in symptomatic knee arthrosis. With this analysis we intend to observe the agreement, any advantage or difference between the incidence and degree of joint involvement between the orthopedic surgeons and radiologists with the referring physician. From January 2012 to March 2012, was a prospective study of 60 symptomatic arthrosis knees (60 patients), clinically selected group of outpatient knee and radiographic proposals submitted to the search. Of the 60 patients, 39 were female and 21 male, mean age 64 years (ranging from 50 to 84 years). Of the 60 knees studied, 37 corresponded to the right side and 23 on the left side. Statistical analysis was performed by Kappa statistics, which evaluates the interobserver agreement for qualitative data. According to the scale of Ahlbäck, there was a significant agreement (p < 0.0001) intra-observer in the classification of knee osteoarthritis among the five evaluators. There was a significant agreement (p < 0.0001) with inter-observer referring physician in the incidence of AP monopodal and AP bipedal for the four raters. The study found no difference between the incidence in the AP monopodal versus AP bipedal in osteoarthritis of the knee.
