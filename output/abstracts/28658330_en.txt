to test the minimally invasive technique of single-port transaxillary subtotal parathyroidectomy in non-formalized cadavers to evaluate its viability and reproduction. we performed ten subtotal parathyroidectomies through a transaxillary TriPort access in cadavers. The technique consisted of access through the axillary fossa, creating a subcutaneous tunnel to the anterior cervical region, for handling of the thyroid gland and dissection and resection of the parathyroid glands. all surgeries were successful. The mean time of surgery was 65 minutes (57-79 min), with uncomplicated identification of all anatomical structures. There was no need for complementary incisions in the cervical region. the transaxillary single-port subtotal parathyroidectomy technique was feasible and reproducible, suggesting an alternative for minimally invasive cervical surgery.
