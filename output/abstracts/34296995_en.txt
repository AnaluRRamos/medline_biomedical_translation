A 71-year-old male presented with Merkel cell carcinoma along with inguinal lymph node involvement (stage III). The patient was proposed for systemic treatment followed by inguinal lymphadenectomy and adjuvant radiotherapy. During the follow-up period, recurrences were documented (lymphatic and visceral) and were treated with salvage surgery and radiotherapy. On the fifth year of follow-up the patient was diagnosed with a metastasis in the right seminal vesicle and underwent stereotactic body radiation therapy. Two-years later, tumor recurrence in the right seminal vesicle was managed with salvage robotic assisted seminal vesiculectomy. Advanced stages of Merkel cell carcinoma have a poor outcome and salvage treatments should be tailored to each patient. A multidisciplinary approach was crucial in achieving successful outcomes. The patient is still recurrence free twenty-four months after surgery. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publication reporting a seminal vesical Merkel cell metastasis.
