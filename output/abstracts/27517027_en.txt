Giant cell tumors are benign bone neoplasms that are relatively rare in adults and their biological behavior is still unpredictable. The incidence of local recurrence has presented variation between 0% and 65% in studies conducted worldwide, but few data are available on this complication in the Brazilian population. Information on 155 patients with confirmed histological diagnoses of giant cell tumor who were treated in our institution's orthopedic oncology service between January 2000 and July 2014 was gathered. Demographic characteristics were evaluated and compared between patients who presented local recurrence during the clinical follow-up. Local recurrence was observed in 26 patients (16.7%), of whom 22 were female (84.6%). The most common site of local recurrence was the distal femur (38.4%). Eleven patients presented early recurrence, while 15 cases were diagnosed after 15 months, representing 42.3% and 57.7%, respectively. Metastases were identified in five patients (3.2%). Tumor-related factors did not show any increased incidence of local recurrence of giant cell tumors. Surgical treatment with an intralesional margin is a valid option for treating local recurrences and does not show any difference in disease-free survival in relation to other types of procedures. Clinical treatment is reserved for cases of unresectable tumors or when surgical treatment is impossible.
