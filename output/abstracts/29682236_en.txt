Young's early maladaptive schemas questionnaire (YSQ-S3) is used to understand psychological aspects. EMSs were evaluated in patients with migraine. Sixty-five subjects were evaluated using the YSQ-S3 under standard conditions in a room with air conditioning at 22 ± 2°C. The subjects were stratified by morbidity (migraine), gender (male/female) and age (18-29 / 30-39 / 40-55). Controls (without migraine), n = 27 and patients (with migraine), n = 38, men (n = 19) and women (n = 46); participants aged 18-29 years, n = 34, aged 30-39 years, n = 14 and aged 40-55 years, n = 17. Data were analyzed using the Chi-square test, with p-values <0.05. Results were expressed as percentages in contingency tables. There was a significant association between migraine and female gender (84.21%; p-value <0.05, Table 1), between hypervigilance and inhibition, and unrelenting standards (56.52%; p-value <0.0.014, Table 2) and female gender with migraine. Moreover, there was a significant association between hypervigilance and inhibition, and unrelenting standards (73.68%; p-value <0.0001) and self-punishment (84.21%; p-value <0.0001) in patients with migraine of both genders (Table 3). The individuals with migraine had a psychological profile of being overly demanding with themselves and others and self-punishing, where this was more frequent in women.
