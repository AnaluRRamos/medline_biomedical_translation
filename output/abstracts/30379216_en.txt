Knowledge about animal models for metabolic study is the basis of research in this area. This work aims to review the main animal models used in the study of obesity and metabolic syndrome. For this, we performed a search in the Pubmed database using the terms 'animal models', 'obesity', 'metabolic syndrome' and 'bariatric surgery'. Several species of animals can be used for the study of metabolic disorders. However, rodents are the most commonly used, both as monogenic models and as diet-induced obesity (DIO) ones. Monogenic animals are the best choice if only one aspect is being evaluated. DIO animals tend to better demonstrate the interaction between disease, environment and genetics. However, they are still not fully effective in providing understanding of all disease mechanisms.
