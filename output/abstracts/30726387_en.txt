This study aimed to analyze foster care time and characteristics of adolescents in the institutional foster care services in the city of Recife. This is a descriptive study with a quantitative approach. The study population consisted of all adolescents under foster care in the city of Recife-PE, in the period 2009-2013. The information was retrieved by consulting the Individual Assistance Plans (IAP), with 1,300 analyzed plans. Variables were categorized and described from absolute and relative frequency. Pearson's chi-square test was used to verify the association between variables, with a significance level of 0.05. Three types of services were observed: for adolescents who are victims of violence and neglect; at-risk with/without drug use; and with special needs. A predominance of older male adolescents, with lower school attendance, greater use of psychotropic substances, involved with socio-educational measures, suffering death threats and with a higher number of service entries-exits was observed. We can conclude that the different profiles of foster care services should be addressed and investigated in a particular way because they show different difficulties related to the establishment of efficient public policies.
