Proliferative and necrotising otitis externa (PNOE) is a rare disorder in cats with poorly understood pathogenesis. Extra-auricular (EA) lesions recently have been mentioned in a textbook and in one case report. To describe EA lesions associated with PNOE in three kittens. A 6-month-old female domestic short hair (DSH) cat (Case 1), an 8-month-old female DSH cat (Case 2) and a 5-month-old female DSH cat (Case 3). All cases exhibited classical lesions of PNOE associated with EA lesions, generalised (cases 1 and 3) or limited to eyelids (Case 2). Lesions were characterised by thick, adherent, hyperkeratotic papules coalescing to plaques and attempts to remove the hyperkeratotic plaques resulted in erosions. Histopathological examinations revealed classical features of PNOE: severe acanthosis associated with a marked lymphocytic exocytosis, satellitosis and apoptotic keratinocytes at all levels of the epidermis and the outer root sheath of hair follicles. Cases 2 and 3 resolved spontaneously. Case 1 remained stable with topical tacrolimus and oral prednisolone after a short course of ciclosporin. This report describes EA lesions of PNOE in three kittens. Such lesions may be underdiagnosed, and this report emphasises the role of a thorough clinical inspection in PNOE cases.
