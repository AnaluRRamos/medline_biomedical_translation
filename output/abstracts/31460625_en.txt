To investigate the food consumption according to the degree of processing and associations with sociodemographic characteristics. A cross-sectional study of the Estudo Pró-Saúde (Pro-Health Study), with 520 civil servants of university campuses, Rio de Janeiro, 2012-13. A food frequency questionnaire was used to classify food consumption: 1) in natura, minimally processed, food preparations based on these foods; 2) processed foods; 3) ultra-processed foods. The relative energy contribution of each group was determined, and a seemingly unrelated equations regression (SUR) regression model was used to estimate associations with sociodemographic characteristics. The in natura food group (1) contributed with 59% of the energy consumption and was directly associated with age [45-49 years (β = 1.8 confidence interval of 95% - 95%CI -1.2; 4.8); 50-54 (β = 1.5 95%CI -1.5; 4.5); 55-59 (β = 2.9 95%CI -0.4; 6.3) and ≥ 60 (β = 4.6 95%CI 1.1; 8.2)], compared to age ≤ 44. In contrast, the group of ultra-processed foods contributed 27% and were inversely associated with age [45-49 (β = -1.7 95%CI -4.3; 0.9); 50-54 (β = -1.8 95%CI -4.3; 0.9); 55-59 (β = -4.9 95%CI -8.0; -2.0); ≥ 60 (β = -4.5 95%CI -7.6; -1.5)]. Gender, income and schooling were not associated with food consumption. Younger adults had higher consumption of ultra-processed foods, indicating the need for interventions mainly in this age group. The absence of association with other sociodemographic characteristics may be due to the influence of contextual factors.
