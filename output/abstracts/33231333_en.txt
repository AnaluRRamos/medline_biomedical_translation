Apocrine cystadenomas have rarely been reported in dogs. Herein, a dog with multiple, large (1.0-7.0Â cm) fluctuant and cystic skin masses on the right pelvic limb and chest is described. Histopathological evaluation revealed cystic cavities lined by single to multiple layers of apocrine epithelium with papillary projections, consistent with apocrine cystadenoma.
