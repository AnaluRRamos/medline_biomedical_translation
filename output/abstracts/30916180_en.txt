The study aimed to identify the cutoff points for inflammatory markers that best discriminate the occurrence of metabolic syndrome in community-dwelling older adults. Baseline data were used from the elderly cohort in the city of Bambuí, Minas Gerais State, Brazil. The target exposure was presence of metabolic syndrome, defined according to the Adult Treatment Panel III criterion, and the outcomes included the following inflammatory markers: cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 e TNF), chemokines (CXCL8, CXCL9, CCL2, CXCL10, and CCL5), and C-reactive protein (CRP). Definition of the cutoff points for the inflammatory markers was based on the Classification and Regression Tree (CART) method. The associations between these markers and metabolic syndrome were estimated by logistic regression models, obtaining odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals, considering adjustment for confounding factors. Prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 49.1%, and IL-1β, IL-12, and TNF levels were not associated statistically with this exposure. After adjustment, presence of metabolic syndrome was associated with higher IL-6 and CRP levels and lower CXCL8 and CCL5. Significant associations were also observed with intermediate serum CXCL9 and CXCL10 levels. The combination of markers also showed a significant and consistent association with metabolic syndrome. In addition to demonstrating an association between metabolic syndrome and a wide range of biomarkers (some not previously described in the literature), the results highlight that this association occurs at much lower levels than previously demonstrated, suggesting that metabolic syndrome plays an important role in the inflammatory profile of the older adults.
