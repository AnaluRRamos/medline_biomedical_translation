Determine the percentage of children under 5 years of age who completed isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) in health facilities in Quito, Ecuador, and assess related factors. Operations research with cohort design. Data were obtained from treatment reports on children in IPT between 2014 and 2016, and from ad hoc surveys of caregivers of children who received IPT in 2018. Children under 5 represented 29.3% of all contacts of index cases; 73% completed IPT and 88.9% had at least six months of therapy. Associations were found with the bacterial load of the index case, with living in a given district, and with the year in which treatment was initiated. Surveys were conducted with nine staff members of health facilities and nine caregivers of children; diverse responses were given regarding the causative agent of tuberculosis, its transmission, and the characteristics of preventive therapy. The majority of children under 5 years of age who initiated IPT completed at least 80% of the prescribed doses, with varying associations and knowledge on the part of their caregivers. In this context, there is a need for further operations research in order to learn more about adherence and about the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of health professionals and those affected by tuberculosis, and their environment.
