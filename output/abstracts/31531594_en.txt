To understand the experiences of obstetric nurses accomplishing the delivery under a low light environment. Qualitative, exploratory and descriptive study. An interview was carried with eight obstetrical nurses at a municipal hospital in SÃ£o Paulo between December 2015 and March 2016. Data was analyzed using content thematic analysis proposed by Bardin. Three themes were studied: 1- Benefits attributed to low light in the delivery room; 2- Difficulties attributed to low light in the delivery room and 3- Effects of low light on the performance of the professional. Low light may facilitate the delivery and increase attention to the moment experienced by the woman and her baby, providing autonomy for the woman and humanized care on the part of the team. The sector's work dynamics and the lack of familiarity with the method have emerged as difficulties, on the part of some professionals and parturients.
