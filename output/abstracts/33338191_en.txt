This investigation of the role played by history and memory in medical education involves the establishment of the Center for Memory and Historical Museum at the Ribeir√£o Preto Medical School. By bringing together three-dimensional objects, photographs, cassette tapes, and collections of donated objects, the Center facilitates historical research and promotes the cultural formation of students, particularly in the area of medicine. This initiative affirms the function of the humanities in developing a critical spirit, and preserves a rich collection that bears witness to the creativity of Brazil's pioneers in medical research. We conclude that this institution has the potential to contribute to history and medical education through its connection to a broad vision of science and university.
