: The objective of this two-part study was to estimate the reproducibility, internal consistency, and construct validity of KIDSCREEN-27, a questionnaire to measure health-related quality of life, in Brazilian adolescents. One study component estimated reproducibility (176 adolescents, 59.7% females, 64.7% 10 to 12 years of age), and another estimated internal consistency and validity (1,321 adolescents, 53.7% females, 56.9% 10 to 12 years of age). The studies were conducted with adolescents of both sexes in public schools in the municipality of João Pessoa, Paraíba State, Brazil. KIDSCREEN-27 consists of 27 items distributed across five domains (physical well-being, 5 items; psychological well-being, 7 items; parents and social support, 7 items; autonomy and relationship with parents, 4 items; school environment, 4 items). Reproducibility was estimated by intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). Confirmatory factor analysis was used to assess construct validity, and composite reliability index (CRI) was used to verify the questionnaire's internal consistency. ICCs were greater than or equal to 0.70 (0.70 to 0.96). Factor loads were greater than 0.40, except for five items (0.28 to 0.39). The model's goodness-of-fit indices were adequate (χ2/df = 2.79; RMR = 0.035; RMSEA = 0.037; GFI = 0.951; AGFI = 0.941; CFI = 0.908; TLI = 0.901). CRI varied from 0.65 to 0.70 in the domains and was 0.90 for the questionnaire. KIDSCREEN-27 reached satisfactory levels of reproducibility, internal consistency, and construct validity and can be used to assess health-related quality of life in Brazilian adolescents 10 to 15 years of age.
