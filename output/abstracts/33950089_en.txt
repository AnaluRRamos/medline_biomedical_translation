Although children have been identified as the group least affected by COVID-19 symptoms (even though they are not automatically shielded from the disease or its severe forms), their daily lives have been affected in various ways, including interruption of in-person school activities and contact with classmates, besides other impacts from social isolation and in many cases family financial and health problems. This study aims to understand the perceptions of children in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil towards SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, and viruses in general, through a qualitative study. We interviewed 20 children via conference services platforms. The findings indicate that children are aware of the risks and necessary precautions for coronavirus prevention, displaying apprehension and fear of catching the disease and transmitting it to their family members. As for viruses in general, we found that their perceptions are related directly to the novel coronavirus, that is, the situation they are dealing with at present. The study provides elements that can help design science dissemination strategies.
