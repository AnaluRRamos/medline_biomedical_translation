This study analyzed the association between food insecurity and hemoglobin and retinol levels in children 6 to 59 months of age. This was a cross-sectional study in 2014 with a representative sample of children in this age bracket treated at basic health units in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Analysis of food insecurity levels used the Brazilian Food Insecurity Scale, and venipuncture was performed for measurement of serum hemoglobin and retinol levels. The association between variables used quantile regression models. Of all the children in the sample, 40.3% presented food insecurity, and the prevalence rates for anemia and vitamin A deficiency were 13.7% and 13%, respectively. The study's results revealed a statistically significant inverse association between mild food insecurity and retinol levels. For the other levels of food insecurity (moderate and severe), the results also suggest an inverse association for hemoglobin, and for retinol levels the point estimates appear smaller in children with severe food insecurity, but these estimates were not statistically significant. These results suggest that food insecurity may be associated with micronutrient deficiencies in children under 5 years.
