This study evaluated the adherence of physicians to the Clinical Protocol and Therapeutic Guidelines on Parkinson's Disease (CPTG-PD) within the scope of the Unified Health System (SUS). A descriptive analysis of 375 drug application documents sent to the Pharmaceutical Services of the Rio Grande do Sul State Public Health Department (AF/SES/RS) between March and September 2016, and a structured survey to evaluate the physician's perception about the protocol and barriers to its use was conducted. Only 5.33% of the requests analyzed presented all the necessary data, considering the criteria of the protocol. The requests from specialists had a higher percentage of adherence to the diagnostic and dose criteria (p<0.05). The main barriers to protocol use were the lack of awareness or familiarity with the protocol (48%) and the lack of time to complete the mandatory documents (52%). More recently qualified physicians tended to perceive fewer barriers to protocol use (p<0.05). The results indicate that actions are still necessary to implement the PCDT-DP in medical practice, focusing on care and management teams. Greater integration between pharmaceutical assistance and the healthcare network is needed.
