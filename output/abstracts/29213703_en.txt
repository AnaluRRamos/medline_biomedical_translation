Although language rehabilitation in patients with primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is recommended, rehabilitation studies in this clinical syndrome are scarce. Specifically, in relation to semantic dementia (SD), few studies have shown the possibility of lexical relearning. To analyze the effectiveness of rehabilitation for lexical reacquisition in SD. Three SD patients were submitted to training for lexical reacquisition based on principles of errorless learning. Comparisons between naming performance of treated items (pre and post-training) and non-treated items of the Boston Naming Test (BNT) were made. All patients improved their performance in naming treated words after intervention. However, decline in performance in naming of non-treated items was observed. Case 1 named zero items at baseline while her performance post-training was 29.4% correct responses without cueing, and 90.7% correct with and without cueing. Case 2 named 6.9% of items correctly at baseline and his performance in post-training was 52.9% without cueing and 87.3%, with and without cueing. Case 3 named zero items at baseline and his performance in post-training was 100% correct responses without cueing. Considering the performance in naming the non-treated items of the BNT, the percentages of correct responses in the first evaluation and in the re-evaluation, respectively were: 16.7% and 8.3% (case 1; 14 month-interval); 26.7% and 11.6% (case 2; 18 month-interval) and 11.6% and 8.3% (case 3; 6 month-interval). The reacquisition of lost vocabulary may be possible in SD despite progressive semantic deterioration.
