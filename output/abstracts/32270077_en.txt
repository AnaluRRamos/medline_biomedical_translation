Milk production is a work system that comprises several tasks from cattle handling, feeding and milking to product consumption. Isometric lumbar extension dynamometry is considered a satisfactory instrument for occupational evaluation and monitoring, especially for populations of workers whose activities demand high levels of strength. To investigate isometric lumbar extension strength among rural milk production workers. The sample comprised 47 rural milk production workers affiliated with the Technical Assistance and Rural Outreach Company/Southern Credit and Rural Assistance Company (Empresa de Assistência Técnica e Extensão Rural/Associação Sulina de Crédito e Assistência Rural - EMATER/ASCAR), Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The participants were analyzed based on a sociodemographic questionnaire and lumbar extensor muscle strength testing by means of an isometric dynamometry system. Participants were 20 men with average age 50.45±9.44 years old and 27 women with average age 46.15±7.56 years old. The isometric lumbar extension strength was 1,169±289.96 N for the men and 571.34±190.36 N for the women. The lumbar extensor muscle profile of rural milk production workers was characterized by higher values for the men, which might be attributed to the fact that men exhibit higher body mass levels, and consequently produce greater force.
