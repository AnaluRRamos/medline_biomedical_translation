to compare the healing by second intention under the effects of topical application of honey, copaíba oil-resin and a commercial product (fibrinolysin, deoxyribonuclease and chloramphenicol) with a control group in rats. we carried out a skin resection, 1cm in diameter, on the back of 40 rats allocated to four groups of ten animals. All wounds were cleaned daily with 2ml of 0.9% NaCl solution. The first group (control - GC) was restricted to such procedure. In the wounds of the second (GM), third (GO) and fourth groups (GF), after cleaning, we respectively applied 1ml of honey, 1ml of copaíba oil-resin and 1ml of cream containing fibrinolysin, deoxyribonuclease and chloramphenicol. The wounds were occluded with sterile gauze. Immediately after the incision and on days three, seven and 14 of the experiment, the wounds were copied and contraction was analyzed using planimetry. After euthanasia, we histologically evaluated the inflammatory reaction and collagen in the scars. the reduction of the wound area of GM (p=0.003), GO (p=0.011) and GF (p=0.002) were higher than the GC. The amount of type-I collagen present in GM and GO was higher than in GC and GF groups (p<0.05). There was a predominance of chronic inflammatory stage in GM (p=0.004), GO (p<0.001) and GF (p=0.003) when compared with GC. the topical use of honey and copaíba oil-resin increases wound contraction, the presence of type-I collagen and accelerates healing.
