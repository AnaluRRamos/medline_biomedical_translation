To present the results of the first application of the new technology - Vertebral Metrics - the analysis of the 3D position of the vertex of each spinous process in pregnant women. The Vertebral Metrics was applied to women without associated pathology in four stages of pregnancy (12, 20, 32, 37 weeks gestation). We applied univariate linear models. We found that the differences that occur during pregnancy are more significant at the position y (anteroposterior). It was found also that there is a positive correlation between the biomechanical position of the vertex of each of the vertebrae with the homologous position of rest. Through Vertebral Metrics innovative results could be obtained in analyzing biomechanics of the spine. A device that has different applications can be easily adopted in areas such as orthopedics, neurosurgery, pediatrics and rehabilitation. It should also be noted that this instrument is not exhausted in the sample of this research because it can be further applied to the general population.
