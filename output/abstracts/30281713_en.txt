to analyze the temporal trend of leukemia mortality in children and adolescents under 20 years old, in Brazilian state capitals and Federal District, between 1980 and 2015. this was a descriptive time series study; age-standardized leukemia mortality rates were calculated; the Prais-Winsten regression model was used. leukemia mortality rates fell from 2.73 to 1.58 per 100,000 inhabitants aged under 20 years in the period studied (annual percentage variation of -7.06%: 95%CI -8.61;5.49), with differences between capitals; there was a reduction in magnitude in all age groups - 0-4 years (9.17%: 95%CI -11.58;-6.69), 5-9 years (-9,27%: 95%CI -11.90;-6.56), 10-14 years (-4.86%: 95%CI -6.69;-3.00) and 15-19 years (-3.77%: 95%CI -5.22;-2.31). there was a falling trend in pediatric leukemia mortality rates, although it was unequal between the capitals, indicating the need for measures to minimize regional differences.
