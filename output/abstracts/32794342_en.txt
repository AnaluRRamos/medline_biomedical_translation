Feline inflammatory aural polyps (IP) have been reported as solitary growths, yet bilateral polyps may occur more commonly than described previously. To identify the prevalence and risk factors associated with bilateral feline IP within a population of cats evaluated at a veterinary teaching hospital over a 10Â year period. Twenty-five cats with histologically confirmed IP. A retrospective study was performed by searching computerized medical records of cats seen at The University of Tennessee Veterinary Teaching Hospital from 2005 to 2015. Keywords used for the search included 'feline polyp', 'ventral bulla osteotomy', 'inflammatory polyp ear canal' and 'nasopharyngeal polyp'. Cats were separated into groups with unilateral or bilateral disease. Six of 25 (24%) cats had bilateral IP. Twelve cats had computed tomography performed (four of six with bilateral IP; eight of 19 with unilateral IP). Clinical signs, history of upper respiratory infection, post-treatment complications, and IP recurrence with and without local and systemic steroid administration were studied between groups and no differences were identified. In four of six cats with bilateral disease, the second polyp was identified with advanced imaging performed at the time of referral. These findings demonstrate that bilateral IP occur more frequently than reported previously and establish a prevalence for bilateral IP. These findings also highlight the value of advanced imaging techniques in diagnosing bilateral IP.
