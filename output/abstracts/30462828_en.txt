to evaluate the results of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the elderly compared with younger patients. we retrospectively reviewed computerized medical records of all patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy for chronic or acute cholecystitis from January 1, 2011 to March 31, 2018 at a single teaching hospital. We stratified the patients into two groups: elderly (≥60 years of age) and younger (<60 years of age). of 1,645 patients subjected to laparoscopic cholecystectomy, 1,161 (70.3%) were younger and 484 (29.7%) were elderly. The rate of male was higher in the elderly (n=185; 38.2%) group than in the younger (n=355; 30.6) (p=0.003). Jaundice was more common in the elderly (p=0.004). The rate of prior abdominal operation was also higher in the elderly (p<0.001). The percentage of patients with ASA score II, III, and IV was higher in the elderly group (p<0.001 in score II and III and 0.294 in score IV). Operative time was longer in the elderly (71.68±31.27) than in the younger group (p=0.001). The following perioperative data were higher in the elderly: acute cholecystitis (p<0.001), conversion rate (p=0.028), postoperative complications (p=0.042), and mortality (p=0.026). the operative time is longer and the rate of acute cholecystitis, conversion to open cholecystectomy and postoperative complications are higher in the elderly patients submitted to laparoscopic cholecystectomy when compared with younger individuals.
