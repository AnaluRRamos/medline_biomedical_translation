To evaluate the effect that external cooling of the salivary glands (ECSG) has on the uptake of gallium-68-labeled prostate-specific membrane antigen (<sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA), as an indirect assessment of the capacity of ECSG to reduce the local dose in lutetium-177-PSMA-617 radioligand therapy. Ten patients with prostate cancer were submitted to <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA positron emission tomography/computed tomography with unilateral ECSG. The ECSG was started at 30 min before the injection of the radiotracer and maintained until the end of image acquisition (1 h after injection). Each salivary gland was assessed by determining the maximum, mean, and peak standardized uptake values (SUVmax, SUVmean, and SUVpeak, respectively). The volume of each gland was determined in a volume of interest delineated by a threshold SUVmax of 10%. Paired Student's t-tests were used in order to compare the results. In terms of the SUV parameters, there were no statistically significant differences between the cooled and contralateral salivary glands. However, the mean volume was 27% lower in the cooled parotid glands than in the contralateral parotid glands (<i>p</i> = 0.004). The use of ECSG does not appear to reduce <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA uptake by the salivary glands. In addition, there is yet no evidence that ECSG is effective in preventing salivary gland toxicity.
