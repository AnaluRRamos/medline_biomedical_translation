The state of health of rural workers is influenced by the living conditions to which they are subjected, including social, economic, technological and organizational aspects. Given the scarcity of studies on this population of workers, establishing their profile is necessary. To analyze cardiovascular risk according to demographic factors and anthropometric status of rural workers under the Pardo River Valley Regional Development Council (COREDE-VRP). Cross-sectional analytical study with rural workers in five municipalities in the COREDE-VRP southern region. We administered a structured questionnaire for lifestyle socioeconomic information, physical activity and self-reported health. Anthropometric measurements, resting heart rate and electrocardiogram (ECG) were performed to analyze heart rate variability (HRV). Women exhibited higher cardiovascular risk, which in turn did not differ as a function of age, marital status, socioeconomic status or lifestyle. We found a relationship between cardiovascular risk and anthropometric measurements, but not with cardiovascular variables. Women exhibited higher cardiovascular risk, which was not associated with marital status, socioeconomic status, alcohol use, smoking, sleep disorders or physical activity. Therefore, we emphasize the relationship between cardiovascular risk and anthropometric variables, as well as the lack of association with heart rate and autonomic imbalance.
