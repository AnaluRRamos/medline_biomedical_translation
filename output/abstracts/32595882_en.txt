Brief cognitive tests (BCTs) are necessary for early detection of cognitive impairment, particularly in primary care settings. This report describes a systematic review of BCTs evaluated in Peruvian populations. We used systematic mapping techniques to identify articles on screening tests for cognitive impairment involving Peruvian subjects. We included studies published in English and Spanish up to 2018. We reviewed 6 reference databases within the Virtual Health Library network, as well as the Web of Science, Scopus (MEDLINE), and EMBASE databases. Ten out of 447 articles met the inclusion criteria. Studies included both outpatient (9) and community-based (2) samples. Eligibility criteria of the studies were similar. Although different protocols were applied, the diagnostic criteria were standardized. For discrimination between dementia and controls, IFS (AUC: 0.99) and ACE (AUC: 0.95 to 1.00) showed superior performance, as did the M@T (AUC: 1.00) and CDT-Mv (AUC: 0.94 to 1.00) for discriminating between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and controls. The available evidence is limited. However, our analysis of national data suggests that the ACE may be a good choice whenever it can be applied to Peruvian patients. Alternatively, the M@T and IFS can be used for screening patients with suspected AD or FTD, respectively.
