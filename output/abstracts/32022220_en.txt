To verify the frequency and severity of dysphagia after ischemic stroke with or without thrombolysis in the acute phase; and the association among dysphagia, demographic characteristics, neurological and functional impairments and thrombolysis. A retrospective study of the medical records of 94 patients who suffered from ischemic stroke during the acute phase of the disease. From these, 52 patients received thrombolytic therapy and 42 patients did not receive such therapy. We collected data on age, sex, comorbidities, therapeutic time window of thrombolytic therapy, level of consciousness, degree of neurological impairment, level of functional dependency and clinical swallowing examination. A descriptive analysis included categorical and continuous variables, and an analysis of the association using the Pearson's Chi-Square Test, in which the value of p â‰¤ 0.05 was considered as a statistically significant association. The frequency of dysphagia in the thrombolytic patients was 67.3%, the odds ratio was 4.6 higher than the non-thrombolysed patients. The severity of dysphagia was not associated with thrombolysis. There was an association between the presence of dysphagia and functional dependence. Demographic characteristics and neurological impairment were not associated with dysphagia. Thrombolytic patients were more likely to develop dysphagia than non-thrombolysed patients in the acute phase of stroke, with dysphagia associated to functional dependence.
