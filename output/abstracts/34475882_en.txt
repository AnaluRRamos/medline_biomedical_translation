This paper examines inequalities in income security in later age. Three dimensions of inequality are considered: (i) inequalities in access to income support across countries and types of schemes; (ii) inequalities in the level of support within countries; and (iii) trends in gender inequality. Scheme stratification reinforces inequalities across socioeconomic groups and gender. More egalitarian, and sustainable, outcomes in later age income security in Latin America require policy reforms aimed at the incorporation of excluded groups and the withdrawal of public subsidies supporting privileged retirees.
