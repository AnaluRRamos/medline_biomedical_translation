The aim of the study is to analyze and correlate functional and radiographic results and quality of life in patients undergoing cementless total hip arthroplasty with ceramic surface, performed at Hospital Servidor Publico de Sao Paulo from 2001 to 2006. We retrospectively analyzed 35 hips treated with cementless total hip arthroplasty with ceramic surfaces with a minimum follow-up of 5 years. Functional evaluation was based on the Harris Hip Score (HHS). Radiographic evaluation was based on the method proposed by Charles Engh for evaluation of femoral osseointegration and on DeLee and Charnley zones for acetabulum. Quality of life was assessed by SF-36 questionnaire. The HHS presented excellent and good results in 91% of patients postoperatively (mean of 93.14 points HHS). As for radiographic evaluation, we found excellent results in 100% of evaluated hips (proven osseointegration). SF-36 scores were not compared to the control group for the following components: pain, vitality, mental health and social aspects. The difference between HHS pre and postoperatively had a statistically significant correlation with physical functioning of the SF-36. Total hip arthroplasty with ceramic surface is a treatment that enables functional improvement of the hip and increases quality of life of patients to levels close to those of people without joint diseases.
