This article describes health service utilization by Quilombola and non-Quilombola adolescents living in a rural area in the semi-arid region of Bahia. Quantitative and qualitative methods were used to gain a more in-depth understanding of the object of study. A cross-sectional household survey was conducted with 390 adolescents. Health service utilization was described using frequency distribution and 95% confidence intervals. Discussions were held with four focus groups, which were transcribed and analyzed using content analysis. The most commonly reported usual place of care was the local family care center (70,0%) and 15,1% of the adolescents had sought health care in the last 15 days. The main reason for seeking care was illness (37,3%). The findings of the qualitative component of the study reveal multiple factors influencing access to services, including long waiting times, lack of prioritization of adolescent care and geographical barriers. Health services should attempt to get closer adolescents and provide care tailored to the specific needs of this group.
