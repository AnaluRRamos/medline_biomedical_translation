Rasmussen encephalitis (RE) is a classic disorder in the child age group, and only 10% of cases are described in adults. We bring two proven cases of RE in older adults aged over 55 years. To describe the clinical characteristics, progression, diagnostic assessment, neuropathological findings, and treatment of RE in two clinical cases of patients over 55 years of age. Furthermore, we address progressive cognitive decline as an important feature of the RE presentation in older adults in association with focal epilepsy. This is a case series from two tertiary hospitals from SÃ£o Paulo - Brazil. Retrospective data were collected from one case. Results: Two male individuals aged >55 years with clinical presentation of focal epilepsy along with progressive cognitive deterioration. RE could be considered the cause of progressive cognitive decline in older adults, especially if focal epilepsy is described together with asymmetrical neuroimaging findings.
