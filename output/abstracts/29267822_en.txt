The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) signs and symptoms, its correlation with gender, parafunctional habits, emotional stress, anxiety, and depression and its impact on oral health-related quality of life (OHRQL) in college preparatory students at public and private institutions in João Pessoa, Paraíba (PB). The sample consisted of 303 students. Presence of TMD symptoms was determined by an anamnesis questionnaire containing questions related to the presence of parafunctional habits and emotional stress. A simplified clinical evaluation protocol was used. Anxiety and depression were determined with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) scale and the OHRQL using the short version contained in the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14). The Chi-square, Fisher Exact, Mann Whitney, and Kruskal-Wallis tests were performed. Presence of signs and symptoms of TMD was statistically associated (p ≤ 0,05) with female gender, parafunctional habits, emotional stress, and anxiety, and represented greater impairment of the OHRQL. The physical pain domain was the most affected. The increased prevalence of signs and symptoms of TMD among college preparatory students indicates that there is a need for education and clarification among teachers and students to improve early diagnosis and to prevent the problem.
