Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is associated with an increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), and the association between CIN and oxidative mechanisms is well documented. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between serum levels of kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and CIN in elderly patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). This study included a total of 758 patients with NSTEMI, who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI); 15 developed CIN after PCI, and another 104 were the control group, matched for age > 65 years. Baseline to 48-to-72-hour laboratory values and clinical outcomes were recorded. Patients were followed during one year. P values of < 0.05 were considered significant. CIN was observed in 12.60% of the patients. Serum KIM-1 was significantly higher in the CIN group than in the non-CIN group (14.02 [9.53 – 19.90] vs. 5.41 [3.41 – 9.03], p < 0.001). The Mehran score was significantly higher in the CIN group than in the non-CIN group (14 [5 – 22] vs. 5 [2 – 7], p = 0.001). MACE were significantly higher in the CIN group than in the non-CIN group (7 [46.70%] vs. 12 [11.50%], p = 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that baseline KIM-1 level (OR = 1.652, 95% CI: 1.20 – 2.27, p = 0.002) and Mehran score (OR = 1.457, 95% CI: 1.01 – 2.08, p = 0.039) were independent predictors of CIN in elderly patients with NSTEMI. Baseline serum KIM-1 concentration and Mehran score are independent predictors of CIN in elderly patients with NSTEMI. Additionally, all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, myocardial reinfarction, stroke, and MACE were significantly higher in the CIN group at one-year follow-up.
