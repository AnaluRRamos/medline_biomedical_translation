Chronic infections can contribute to the aging process, but this issue is less studied in Latin America. The aim was to assess the prevalence and factors associated with cytomegalovirus (CMV), Herpes Simplex 1 (HSV-1), Chlamydia pneumoniae and Helicobacter pylori among the elderly. A total of 1,320 individuals participated from the baseline of the Elderly Cohort of Bambuí. IgG antibodies against infections and explanatory variables (sociodemographic factors, health behaviors and health conditions) were evaluated. Poisson regression models with robust variance were used. Seroprevalence rates were 99.4% for CMV, 96.7% for HSV-1, 56% for C. pneumoniae and 70.5% for H. pylori. Elderly men, women, smokers, diabetics, the disabled and those with high levels of IL-6 had a higher prevalence of CMV. HSV-1 was less frequent among women. The prevalence of C. pneumoniae was higher at ages >75 and among diabetics; it was lower among women and individuals with less schooling. H. pylori was less frequent among women and those with detectable levels of IL-1β, but more common among smokers. The findings show a high prevalence of chronic infection and a different epidemiologic profile for each pathogen, making it possible to detect groups that are vulnerable to these infections.
