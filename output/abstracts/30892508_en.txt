Recently, the Brazilian Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics Associations submitted a request to the Brazilian Ministry of Health for an introduction of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) methods for young women aged 15 to 19 years in the Brazilian Unified National Health System. The two devices to be included were the etonogestrel-releasing subdermal implant (ENG implant), with a duration of three years, and the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS), lasting five years. The Ministry of Health then launched a public inquiry to evaluate this introduction, deciding against the inclusion of these methods in the public health services. The article discusses the discursive strategies used to justify the acceptance and applicability of these methods in 'special populations.' The debate on family planning needs to understand fully the discontinuity of contraception in the use of such methods, the central concept of emergency contraception, and how gender hierarchies prejudice safe contraceptive practice. On the contrary, the emphasis on the (in)discipline of women regarding care with regular-use contraceptive methods effectively reinforces their condition of social minority.
