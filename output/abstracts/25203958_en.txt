Angiogenesis is a key factor for the successful establishment and growth of endometriotic lesions. We performed a literature search in PubMed and reviewed the most pertinent studies published until January 2014 and focused on the endometriosis-associated angiogenesis and/or anti-angiogenic strategies for the treatment of this gynecological disorder. The present review provides a concise summary of the known molecular mechanisms that promote vascularization of endometriotic lesions and may serve as potential therapeutic targets. We also present a systematic overview of the inclusive and exclusive anti-angiogenic agents that have been already studied in cell cultures, animal models and/or endometriosis patients. The integration of anti-angiogenic approaches in the multimodal management strategies for endometriosis patients will be conditioned by the outcomes of future assessments regarding the effectiveness of such treatments, the risk of drug resistance development and the incidence of unacceptable side effects.
