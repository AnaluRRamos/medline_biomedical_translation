Data on unsafe abortions are scarce, and estimates based on hospitalizations have pointed to a decline in recent years. The study aimed to analyze the time trend in unsafe abortions in the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 2008 to 2017. We used secondary data on hospitalizations in the Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS) due to complications of abortion in childbearing-age women (CAW) 15 to 44 years of age. We applied indirect estimation with a correction factor based on national and state data. We calculated the unsafe abortion rate per CAW (UAR-CAW), ratio of unsafe abortions per live births (RUA-LB), according to age bracket. We also calculated new indicators: spontaneous abortion rate (SAR) and unspecified abortion rate (USAR) per CAW; ratio of spontaneous abortions (RSA) and ratio of unspecified abortions (RUSA) per live births, independently of age. Time trend was calculated by Joinpoint regression, calculating the annual percent change (APC) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). The women that most induced abortions were 20 to 24 years of age, with UAR of 8 per 1,000. Pregnancies that ended in unsafe abortion were most frequent in the 40-44-year bracket: UAR of 16 to 20 per 100 live births. Adolescents showed a reduction in UAR from 2015 to 2017 (APC = -10; 95%CI: -18.2; -1.1), while there was an increase in women 40-44 years of age from 2008 to 2017 (APC = 2.2; 95%CI 0.5 to 4.0). The other age brackets and the indicator UAR-LB showed stability. SAR (APC = -3.5; 95%CI: -5.9; -1.0), and RSA (APC = -3.8; 95%CI: -6.3; -1.2) decreased, while USAR (APC = 6.6; 95%CI: 1.7; 11.8) and RUSA (APC = 6.4; 95%CI: 1.6; 11.3) increased during the period. The magnitude and time trend of unsafe abortions in the State of Rio de Janeiro differed according to age bracket and ICD-10 code.
