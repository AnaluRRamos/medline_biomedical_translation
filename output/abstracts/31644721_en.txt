to evaluate the oral conditions and the main predisposing factors for dental treatment of patients on the waiting list for liver and simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation, in a single center. we evaluated 100 patients in the waiting list, 50 candidates for liver transplantation and 50 for simultaneous kidney-pancreas transplantation, from August 2015 to February 2018. We correlated extra and intraoral examinations with pre-transplant demographic variables. the main oral alteration in the pancreas-kidney and liver transplant candidates were decayed, lost and filled teeth, present in 83% and 100% of the candidates, respectively (p=0.03). The need for dental treatment was equal in both groups: 71% and 70%. In liver transplant candidates, the predisposing factors for dental treatment were age, color and etiological diagnosis of liver cirrhosis. We did not identify predisposing factors for dental treatment in candidates for simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplant. candidates for liver and for simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation had poor oral hygiene, with cavities, residual roots, gingivitis and periodontitis, revealing that dental evaluation should be part of the transplantation waiting list.
