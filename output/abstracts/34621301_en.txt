To determine the impact of household out-of-pocket health spending, financial protection levels, and their inequality according to relevant variables in the countries of the Region; to investigate their evolution and relationship with health system services utilization. Comparative descriptive information was compiled on out-of-pocket spending, its incidence in the population, and its weight and contribution to household consumption. Financial protection indicators for the national level and their distribution by quintiles of total household consumption and by gender are presented, and compared to an indicator of service coverage. Out-of-pocket spending and financial protection indicators are deficient but demonstrate differences among countries. The composition of health expenditure is identified for a subset of countries and significant gradients are seen when inequalities are studied. Changes over time and possible associations with service coverage levels are shown for several cases. Lack of financial protection affects a large part of the population. Additionally, there are groups of countries with greater difficulties than others, where a preponderance of spending is on medicines, and there is greater exposure of groups in conditions of vulnerability, such as the poorest and women, indicating great inequity. Policies of some countries that can be associated with improvement in financial protection are identified. To replace out-of-pocket spending, which is a barrier to access, countries need to increase public spending by financing health systems undergoing transformation toward universal health.
