Some cognitive dimensions, such as attention, memory and executive functions, may decline with age, while other functions remain intact or even improve due to greater life experience. to analyze the relationship between cognitive processing, language and verbal fluency among elderly individuals seen by primary healthcare services located in a city in the interior of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. a cross-sectional study with a quantitative method was conducted. A total of 149 elderly individuals were assessed through previously scheduled interviews. Data collection included a questionnaire on sociodemographic data and the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination - Revised (ACE-R). Cognitive processing (P300) was assessed using a device that captures potentials elicited in auditory tasks. Descriptive analysis and Spearman's correlation were performed with the level of significance established at 5%. a negative correlation was found between language and P300 latency, while a positive correlation was found between verbal fluency and P300 amplitude. Comprehension and naming tasks showed a negative correlation with latency. The repetition task revealed a positive correlation with P300 amplitude. although more extensive testing is needed, these findings suggest that language correlates with P300 latency, whereas verbal fluency correlates with P300 amplitude.
