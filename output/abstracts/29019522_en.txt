The aim of this study was to estimate the mortality burden according to major groups of causes, with a focus on diabetes mellitus, as well as differences according to the presence or absence of health coverage for Argentina as a whole and its regions. The study used the mortality database for individuals 30 years or older in 2009-2011, stratified by sex, age bracket, region, underlying cause of death, and health coverage. We calculated the mortality rates and years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLLs). The quality of mortality records in Argentina was unsatisfactory, due to the high proportion of garbage codes for deaths. The main results showed a preponderance of chronic non-communicable diseases in the mortality burden in all regions of Argentina. In the Northeast, one of the country's poorest regions, the burden of mortality was high for all groups of causes. The mortality rates and adjusted YLL rates for diabetes mellitus were highest in the Cuyo region. There were marked differences in adjusted YLL rates according to health coverage status. The study's results highlight the need to develop measures to decrease regional and socioeconomic inequalities identified by mortality differences in Argentina.
