Identify barriers and reasons why children under 5 do not get vaccinated in some Colombian cities. Qualitative design based on interviews and focus groups of health workers and caregivers in four Colombian cities selected according vaccination coverage and population densities. Different factors were identified that may hinder completion of vaccination schedules in the two municipalities with low coverage, such as fear of a post-vaccination reaction, socioeconomic and geographical conditions and population safety, working conditions of the vaccination staff, administrative and economic problems, and precarious information systems. From a qualitative standpoint, the vaccination teams and caregivers pointed to social and institutional issues that may hinder vaccination coverage in the cities that participated in the study.
