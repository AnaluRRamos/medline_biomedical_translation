To assess the efficacy of non-surgical treatment for adenomyosis.  A search was performed by two authors in the Pubmed, Scopus, and Scielo databases and in the grey literature from inception to March 2018, with no language restriction.  We have included prospective randomized studies for treating symptomatic women with adenomyosis (abnormal uterine bleeding and/or pelvic pain) diagnosed by ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging.  Studies were primarily selected by title and abstract. The articles that were eligible for inclusion were evaluated in their entirety, and their data was extracted for further processing and analysis.  From 567 retrieved records only 5 remained for analysis. The intervention groups were: levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS)(n = 2), dienogest (n = 2), and letrozole (n = 1). Levonorgestrel intrauterine system was effective to control bleeding when compared to hysterectomy or combined oral contraceptives (COCs). One study assessed chronic pelvic pain and reported that LNG-IUS was superior to COC to reduce symptoms. Regarding dienogest, it was efficient to reduce pelvic pain when compared to placebo or goserelin, but less effective to control bleeding than gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog. Letrozole was as efficient as GnRH analog to relieve dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia, but not for chronic pelvic pain. Reduction of uterine volume was seen with aromatase inhibitors, GnRH analog, and LGN-IUD.  Levonorgestrel intrauterine system and dienogest have significantly improved the control of bleeding and pelvic pain, respectively, in women with adenomyosis. However, there is insufficient data from the retrieved studies to endorse each medication for this disease. Further randomized control tests (RCTs) are needed to address pharmacological treatment of adenomyosis.
