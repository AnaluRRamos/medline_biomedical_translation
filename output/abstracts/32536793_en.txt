An observational study was carried out to determine the rate of acute kidney injury (AKI) following surgery for hip fracture at our institution and to look for factors associated with AKI. Preoperative creatinine values were compared to post-operative results for all patients who underwent surgery for hip fracture at our institution between 1<sup>st</sup> January 2015 and 30<sup>th</sup> September 2016. AKI was defined as an increase in postoperative creatinine, greater than or equal to 1.5 times the preoperative value within 7 days. Chi-squared test and Student's t-test were used to look for factors associated with AKI. Out of 500 patients, 96 developed an AKI (19.2%). Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) were more likely to develop AKI (30.8%) that those without it (17.2%, p = 0.018). Similarly, patients with 2 or more comorbidities were more likely to develop AKI (22.0%) than those without it (12.4%, p = 0.009). No statistically significant association was observed between type of surgery and AKI. A large proportion of patients following surgery for hip fracture developed AKI. Patients with CKD and the presence of 2 or more comorbidities had significantly higher rates of AKI. <b>Level III evidence, Retrospective comparative study</b>.
