Primary bone lymphoma is a rare neoplasm that can initially present as local pain, a palpable mass, and pathologic fracture. It can also be discovered as an incidental finding on an imaging examination. It is defined as a bone marrow tumor with no involvement of other sites, lasting at least six months. The diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy and immunohistochemical analysis. Although the imaging characteristics are nonspecific, there are certain findings that, when correlated with clinical and epidemiological aspects, can increase the level of suspicion of primary bone lymphoma. The classic imaging aspect is a bone lesion with a soft-tissue component that preserves the cortical layer more than would be expected given the invasive nature of the lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging is the best imaging method to evaluate the extent of involvement of adjacent compartments, whereas computed tomography depicts the cortical layer in greater detail, as well as being an important tool for biopsy guidance. Other imaging modalities are also discussed, such as X-ray, ultrasound, bone scintigraphy, and positron emission tomography/computed tomography. The aim of this paper is to describe the most common findings obtained with the various imaging methods used in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of primary bone lymphoma.
