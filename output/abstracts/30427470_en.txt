The scope of this paper was to evaluate the self-rated health among elderly frequenters of low-budget community restaurants (RP) in Belo Horizonte (BH) and the factors associated with this outcome. It involved a cross-sectional study in all RP and BH cafeteria. The self-rated health was classified as bad and very bad; average; good and very good. Sociodemographic and economic variables were considered to be possible associated factors, as well as those related to physical health and social resources. In the univariate analysis, the Chi-square test and Mann-Whitney tests were used. In the multivariate analysis a model of ordinal logistic regression was created. The sample consisted of 279 elderly people, the majority (68.5%) being male. Most of the elderly (57.5%) considered their health as being good or very good. Factors associated with better health perception in the multivariate analysis (p-value < 0.05) were satisfaction with relationships with friends, not having diabetes or any other cardiovascular disease and finally, the low frequency and lack of problems that hinder the elderly from doing the things they need or want to do. Such studies contribute to the understanding of the health perception of elderly people associated with several factors that can influence healthy aging.
