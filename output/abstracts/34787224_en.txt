This study explores access to health services for lesbians in the light of current literature. A literature search was conducted using various databases and an interpretive synthesis of the findings of the selected articles was produced anchored in the concepts of habitus and symbolic violence developed by Pierre Bourdieu. Two main themes and their respective units of meaning were identified: (a) barriers and difficulties experienced by lesbians in accessing healthcare (issues related to coming out as a lesbian and difficulties experienced by health services and professionals in dealing with lesbian women); and (b) lesbian women's experiences in health services (unequal care, invisibility, and feeling uncomfortable). We conclude that, despite advances in policy and care protocols, sexual and gender diversity needs to be widely discussed in social, educational, and health settings.
