Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) play an important role in maintaining endothelial function. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is associated with EPC dysfunction. Although physical exercise has a beneficial impact on EPC activity, its mechanism is not completely clear yet. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of physical exercise on the functions of EPCs and the underlying mechanisms in patients with MetS. Volunteers with MetS were divided into exercise group (n=15) and control group (n=15). Before and after 8 weeks exercise training, EPCs were isolated from peripheral blood. Colony forming unit (CFU) assay, tube-formation assay, the protein expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3-K) and protein kinase B (AKT) were determined. A probability value <0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. After 8 weeks, the number of CFUs was significantly increased in the exercise group compared to the control group (p<0.05). In addition, we observed a significant decrease of homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), endothelin-1, high-sensitive C-reactive protein, and homocysteine levels in the exercise group. Exercise intervention could also enhance tube-formation capacity of EPCs and increase phosphorylation level of eNOS, PI3-K and AKT. Physical exercise enhanced the functions of EPCs. The mechanism may be related to exercise, activating the PI3-K/AKT/eNOS pathway.
