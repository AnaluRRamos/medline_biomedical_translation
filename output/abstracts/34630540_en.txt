Obesity can increase the risk of diabetes mellitus and complications associated with it. The aim of this study was to estimate the associations between new and old anthropometric indices and the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its metabolic complications. In this cross-sectional analytical study, 110 T2DM subjects and 110 healthy controls were selected by convenience sampling. Metabolic factors were evaluated including the atherogenic index of plasma (AIP), glycemic status, lipid profile, blood pressure, kidney indices, new anthropometric indices (abdominal volume index [AVI], body shape index [ABSI], lipid accumulation product [LAP], body adiposity index [BAI], and conicity index [CI]), and old anthropometric indices (weight, body mass index [BMI], and waist and hip circumference [WC and HC]). Significant positive correlations were observed between AVI, LAP, and BAI and fasting blood glucose and HbA1c in the T2DM group (p < 0.001 for all associations). The odds ratio (OR) for T2DM elevated significantly with increasing BMI (OR: 1.30, 95% CI: 1.20-1.42), LAP (OR: 1.20, 95% CI: 1.13-1.27), and BAI (OR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.21-1.43). The indices AVI (OR: 1.90, 95% CI: 1.57-2.29), LAP (OR: 1.19, 95% CI: 1.13-1.27), BAI (OR: 1.19, 95% CI: 1.12-1.26), WC (OR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.18, 1.42), and HC (OR: 1.07, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.14) significantly increased the risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS). Associations were identified between obesity indices and diabetes. These indices could be used in clinical practice for evaluation and control of T2DM.
