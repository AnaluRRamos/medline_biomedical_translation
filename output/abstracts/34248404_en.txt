The synovial fold is an intra-articular structure found in more than 50% of the knees, which can cause symptoms similar to meniscal injuries. These symptoms are mostly related to hypertrophy of the synovial fold resulting from inadequate physical activity. Conservative treatment with readjustment of sports activity and muscle rebalancing solves most cases. Rare cases require surgical treatment, which is indicated due to the persistence of instability, blockage and pain. We present our experience in the treatment of this pathology. 58 patients (70 knees), with 62 knees treated conservatively and 8 treated surgically exclusively for the pathological synovial fold. Results: Description of the series and treatment results are reported. The non-surgical treatment of the pathological synovial fold of the knee provided good results within 60 days of rehabilitation program in almost 90% of the patients. Arthroscopic resection of the synovial fold is a surgery that has a longer and laborious rehabilitation period, despite good results in most cases. <b><i>Level of Evidence IV, Case series</i>.</b>
