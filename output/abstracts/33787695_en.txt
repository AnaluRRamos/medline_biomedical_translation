Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is intended to improve the efficiency and quality of health services provided to the population and reduce the operational costs of prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation; the objective of EBM is to identify relevant issues and promote the social applicability of conclusions. This article underscores the importance of EBM in modern clinical teaching and social practices from the contributions of Archibald Cochrane and David Sackett to the development and dissemination of this paradigm in care and education during the twentieth century. EBM has helped broaden discussions on the relationships between teaching and medical practice, and has taken on an important role in curriculum reforms and training models and practices in health care.
