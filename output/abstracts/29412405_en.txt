The objective was to examine the association between life events post diagnosis of breast câncer and metastasis. Cross-sectional study with 300 women attending a reference hospital in oncology in the Espírito Santo. Was used the instrument Life Events Units-LEU/VAS to evaluate life events reported by women. Data were analyzed by using the nonparametric Wilcoxon and chi-square tests. It was performed odds ratio calculation for the variables associated with metastasis. It was found that 21% of the sample reported at least one life event post diagnosis. Of the 46 women who developed metastases, 20 reported one or more life events (p = 0.001). The odds ratio calculated shows that having life events post diagnosis increases by 2.59 (1,37 - 4,91; p = 0,003) times the chance of developing metastasis. When considering the time between diagnosis and the onset of metastasis there was a median of 18.0 months. The study shows a relationship between life events and metastasis, however emphasize the importance of a more complex analysis to better understand the impacts of these events on the onset and progression of breast cancer.
