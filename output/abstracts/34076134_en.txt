The aim of this article is to assess the association between body image dissatisfaction and sociodemographic and health behaviors, according to sex. Data were analyzed for 6,289 women and 5,188 men (35-59 years), participants in the baseline of the Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil), using multinomial regression. The odds of dissatisfaction due to feeling underweight were higher among in women with low schooling and those who only consumed fruit weekly. Moderate physical activity reduced this type of dissatisfaction by 50%. Higher odds of dissatisfaction due to overweight were seen in married women, those who practiced light physical activity, and former smokers. Men with secondary schooling and excessive alcohol consumption showed 50% higher odds of dissatisfaction due to underweight, while light or moderate physical activity increased the odds by 75% and 94%, respectively. Among men, light and moderate physical activity were also associated with increased odds of dissatisfaction due to overweight. These findings corroborate that unhealthy habits and behaviors can influence body image dissatisfaction with different patterns between women and men.
