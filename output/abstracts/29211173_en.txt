This article highlights the fact that the work of Josu√© de Castro brings to light some of the most relevant interpretations on the Brazilian food situation, launching the first proactive manifesto for the construction of a social policy on food in Brazil. Underpinning this debate, there are aspects of the process of construction of the Nation State, national development and the role of the Brazilian intellectuals. Such issues are added to the author's concern with the formation of proactive measures that could lead to social change and redefinitions of the conditions of social exclusion of a significant portion of the Brazilian population. We start from the assertion that his work is part of broader interpretations about Brazil, which need to be revisited.
