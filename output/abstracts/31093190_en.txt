The objective of this paper is to describe the current situation of mental health in Ecuador. In Ecuador, although the model of community mental health has been integrated into primary health care services for a decade, its implementation does not seem to have the expected results. It is pertinent to explore the causes of this situation and to propose alternatives, taking into account the contributions of social medicine, collective health and participatory action research as emblematic models in Latin America in the field of mental health. For an effective implementation of community mental health in primary care in Ecuador, the role of universities is central, specifically in projects linked to the community and in pre-professional practices in health sciences careers. These projects allow the promotion of community mental health in the first level of health care from a critical perspective, open to complexity and based on the principle that the community is the main active subject of social transformation.
