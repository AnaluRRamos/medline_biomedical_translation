To analyze the mandibular movements of patients with painful TMD during the speech function in order to understand possible alterations and which subgroups of patients may present them. In addition to identifying which signs and symptoms related to painful TMD are perceived in the performance of this function. Thirty-two subjects aged between 18-60 years old (35.1 Â± 8.9), 23 with TMD ( DC/TMD; eight men and 15 women) and nine controls were evaluated regarding: self-perception of TMD signs and symptoms during speech (ProTMDMulti); range of mandibular movements during the reading of a word list (electrognatography, Jaw Motion Analyzes). The percentage of movement usage during the speech performance as a function of maximum individual amplitude was calculated, and groups of patients with painful TMD (TMD-D) and painful/joint (TMD-D/A) were subdivided. The TMD-D/A group presented a higher percentage of use of lateral movement during speech than the other groups. Pain, joint noise, and difficulty in speaking were the most commonly reported signs/symptoms of speech performance. The perception of joint noises and the presence of lateral deviations were significantly higher in the TMD-D/A group (p<0.05). The lateral deviations are the main alteration of the mandibular movement during the speech performance in painful TMD. Such deviations are more expected in joint TMD (disc displacement and degenerative diseases). The perception of pain and joint noise are the main complaints related to the orofacial speech function in individuals with painful TMD.
