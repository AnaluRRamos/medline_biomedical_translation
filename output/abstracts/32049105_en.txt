To describe and characterize a finding, i.e., delayed posterior leakage of food residue during swallowing, according to age, gender and food consistency, which occurred in the event. Data were collected through the analysis of each functional videonasoendoscopy test of swallowing previously recorded in a specialist outpatient clinic. The study population included 200 patients, both males and females, aged between 46 and 87 years, with and without an underlying pathology for dysphagia. The images were studied individually by the researcher and analyzed by judges in order to identify and select images that would confirm the presence or absence of the study event. Delayed escape was found in 45 out of the 200 analyzed tests. The tests selected for the study showed delayed posterior bolus leakage in at least one consistency. The highest frequency of delayed posterior leakage occurred with fluids. The analysis showed the significance of the study event with the population related to older ages in the sample analyzed. Delayed posterior leakage occurs predominantly in the liquid consistency in older populations with no gender predominance.
