The increase in dementia incidence among the elderly is directly related to aging, which is associated with changes in bodily functions and other health-related risk factors. Alzheimer's dementia is the most prevalent form of dementia, and individuals in the late stages are predominantly dependent on other family members. Therefore, it is important for families, as the closest support group, to recognize common symptoms early. To provide a family-friendly guide to the ten common symptoms of Alzheimer's dementia. This is a descriptive survey-based research that included 354 families comprising elderly people (≥60 years) residing in Jakarta. The instrument aimed at identifying ten common Alzheimer's dementia symptoms in Indonesia. Descriptive statistical analysis based on frequency tables was used. The participant's major characteristics were age ≥66 years (52.3%), female sex (70.3%) and primary school education (87.3%). The predominant symptoms experienced by 42.4% of the elderly included forgetting recent events and asking questions and narrating a particular detail repeatedly. The remaining 35.6% demonstrated signs of forgetting where an item was placed and frequently suspecting others of theft and concealment of personal items. The symptoms of frequently forgetting new events and the location of personal belongings are of particular concern for families, as they have a propensity to progress and interfere with daily activities. Therefore, the families of affected individuals are expected to identify this symptom early on and present the affected individual for screening or examination at a health care facility.
