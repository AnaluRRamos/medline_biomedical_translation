to analyze the completeness and reliability of data on perinatal deaths held on Brazil's Mortality Information System (SIM) in 2011-2012. this was a study evaluating the quality of completeness of data on perinatal deaths reported on SIM compared to data from the 'Birth in Brazil' survey for the same period; to evaluate reliability, we used the Kappa coefficient, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and the Bland-Altman plot method. completeness was greater than 80%, and agreement was 0.61 for 10 of the 12 evaluated fields; aggregated gestation length (Kappa coefficient=0.542) and continuous gestation length (ICC=0.448) for early neonatal deaths and fetal deaths, respectively, had regular agreement; graphical evaluation of gestation length showed that the fetal death metric was underestimated and that early neonatal deaths were overestimated by between 25 and 35 weeks of gestation. the information analyzed available on SIM for perinatal deaths is complete and reliable for the period analyzed.
