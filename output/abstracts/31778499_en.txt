This article addresses recent political, legal and welfare changes to mental health policies in Brazil, demonstrating their effects of Psychiatric Counter-Reform. Based on documentary analysis, we explain the tensions generated by this process, with its repercussions for the complex process of Brazilian Psychiatric Reform, particularly for the Psychosocial Healthcare Network. We discuss the paradoxical case of Counter-Counter-Reform, using the state of Bahia as an example because of its recent proposal to close psychiatric hospitals with the announced aim of deinstitutionalizing people who have been hospitalized, which does not coincide with this moment of change in Brazilian mental health policy. We conclude that the risk of the worsening of the sanitary, social and economic crisis in the country requires increased advocacy and mobilization measures, in order to prevent the loss of social protection mechanisms, which also include mental health. This crisis simultaneously poses a threat to human rights and to the inclusion of people in psychological distress, at the same time as it presents an opportunity to reinvigorate a reform that was at the peak of activity.
