To verify the effectiveness of educational interventions based on guidance on physical activity and nutrition in schoolchildren. A systematic search was carried out in four electronic databases containing articles published between October 2007 and January 2017 and addressing educational interventions with emphasis on both nutritional education and physical activity in schoolchildren and adolescents aged 10 to 19 years. Twelve articles were selected for this review, of which four included only educational interventions; four made and association between educational interventions, inclusion of healthy foods and physical activity; two made a relation between guidelines and physical activity; and finally, two associated guidelines with consumption of healthy foods. Interventions based on physical activity and/or nutrition counseling were efficient and showed superior results in studies that associated the practice of physical activity with counseling. However, the need for new studies on educational interventions among schoolchildren and adolescents was made evident.
