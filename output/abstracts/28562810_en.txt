Evaluating the teaching-learning process of undergraduates and nursing professionals on the International Classification for Nursing Practice (ICNP®) through a course on Moodle Platform. Mixed research conducted with 51 nursing students and nurses. Many technological and educational resources were used. To collect data, two semi-structured questionnaires were applied and focus groups were carried out. Statistical and thematic analysis of the data was performed. There was a correlation between the Wiki variable, the Animation Video (p = 0.002) and the Arch Method (p = 0.04), as well as a correlation between the Forum, the Virtual Book (P < 0.001) and time (p = 0.009). Three topics emerged: innovation in the application of technological resources, distance education in the professional education and permanent education and the teaching-learning process on the ICNP® in a collaborative way. Teaching-learning strategies and technological resources used were pointed out as innovative and helped students have a better performance.
