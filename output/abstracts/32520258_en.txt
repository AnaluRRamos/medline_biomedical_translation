The scope of this article is to verify the validity and consistency of entries in medical records and self-reporting about the use of the health services by elderly users of the Health Care Network. It involved a cross-sectional, population-based observational study. Entries in medical, dental, home visit, referral to the secondary sector and hospitalization appointment records for the years 2015 and 2016 were evaluated. The concordance percentage, Kappa coefficient, sensitivity, specificity and predictive values for each item were also analyzed. The highest concordance percentage (81.93%) with a significant Kappa coefficient (p = 0.03) was for hospitalization. The dentistry appointments revealed a higher Kappa coefficient (k = 0.271) with significance of p=0.01. The analyses showed high specificity in the hospitalization records (83%), and a greater sensitivity for home visits (74%). Positive predictive values were low for hospitalization (8%), and negative predictive values were low for medical appointments (17%). The low concordance between the use of the self-reported health service and entries in medical records highlight one of the possible causes of the fragmentation in continuity of care.
