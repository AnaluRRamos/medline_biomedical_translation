Aneurysms and atheromatous processes are prominent pathological features that are commonly associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This cadaveric study was conducted to evaluate the morphometric and histological aspects of atheromatous plaque formation in abdominal aortas and their branches and their associated morphological variations, if present, characterized by loops, kinking, or tortuosity. The study was performed using 30 human cadavers (approx. 65-75 years). Frequency of occurrence of calcified plaques in the abdominal aorta and its branches and their morphometric measurements were noted and histological features were observed with the aid of Hematoxylin & Eosin staining. Variations in the abdominal aorta and the common iliac artery were observed in 16.6% of specimens. Atheromatous plaque formation was seen in 2 specimens (1 specimen was associated with kinking) while in 3 other specimens only variation in normal structure (kinking/ tortuous artery) was observed. Histological analysis showed foamy macrophages and dense calcification, giving an atheromatous appearance. Cadaveric reports of the location, nature, and degree of plaque formation in the abdominal aorta and its branches are extremely important in clinical settings and for choosing treatment options.
