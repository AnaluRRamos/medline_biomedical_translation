Cancer in individuals 0 to 19 years of age is considered rare when compared to incidence in older age brackets, and is estimated at 2% to 3% of all malignant tumors recorded in Brazil. The use of anthracyclines is frequently associated with cardiotoxicity, and these drugs are part of approximately 60% of treatment protocols in pediatric oncology. Among the existing strategies for the prevention of cardiotoxicity, dexrazoxane obtained favorable results based on intermediate outcomes (biochemical markers and echocardiographic parameters). This study was based on a cost-effectiveness assessment comparing the use of dexrazoxane in different populations, besides an assessment of the budget impact from the technology's potential incorporation. The patient's lifetime was used as the timeline, and the analysis was performed from the perspective of the Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS). A budget impact analysis was also performed for each technology. After a literature search, a Markov model was developed, capable of comparing the use of dexrazoxane in six profiles of patients at risk of developing cardiotoxicity. Use of the drug in children under 5 years of age proved to be the most cost-effective alternative (incremental cost effectiveness ratio - ICER of BRL 6,156.96), followed by use in all patients (ICER of BRL 58,968.70). If the price decreased to less than BRL 250.00 per vial, the alternative of using the drug in all children would become the most cost-effective. The budget impact at 5 years was BRL 30,622,404.81 for use only in children under 5 years of age. Using the technology in all the children could produce an incremental impact of BRL 94,352,898.77.
