The use of the history and philosophy of science in teaching and learning is commonly neglected, linear, and/or out of context in textbooks. This article investigates whether this also occurs with the concept of enzymes. A brief review of the literature establishes the theoretical foundation to investigate how the concept of enzymes is presented in nine textbooks, following three different lines of analysis. A general lack of interconnection was seen in biochemistry topics, with enzymes usually only presented via the 'lock-and-key' model, which does not best represent their complexity. Furthermore, conceptual limitations resulting from a lack of historical contextualization (partial or complete) were also observed.
