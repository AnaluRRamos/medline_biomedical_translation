The scope of this paper was to analyze the time series of dental procedures performed between 2000 and 2016 in the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS). The data were obtained from the Outpatient Information System of the SUS (SIA-SUS). The influence of the 2004 National Oral Health Policy of Ordinance No. 600/2006 (which instituted the financing of Dental Specialty Centers - CEOs), and Ordinance No. 1,234/2013 (Financial incentive for the Program for Enhancement of Quality and Access - PMAQ-CEO) were analyzed. Descriptive analyses of the initial and final years of the time series were presented, assessing trends and seasonality in seven types of imaging procedures. The time series of rates of periapical/bitewing radiographic exams revealed a trend of moderate increase and was the only area in which the impact of the financial implementation policy of the CEOs was observed, though not of the PMAQ-CEO. Extraoral imaging exams, such as panoramic radiography, facial CT/TMJ and TMJ MRI revealed a strong upward trend, despite the very low rates. The conclusion reached is that between 2000 and 2016, the policy of expansion of secondary care increased the use of periapical/bitewing imaging exams.
