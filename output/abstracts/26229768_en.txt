To evaluate clinical and radiological results with open reduction and internal fixation of severe fractures of the proximal humerus in the patients over the age of 60 years. Between June 1992 and February 2011, 21 patients with FGEPU over the age of 60 years were treated by open reduction and internal fixation at the Group of Shoulder and Elbow Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology of Santa Casa de São Paulo Medical School. 18 patients were reviewed. Two patients had excellent results, 12 good, three regular and one bad. Therefore, we find that 77.7% of these had good and excellent results. All patients were satisfied with the treatment and only three patients did not return to previous activities. Mean postoperative mobilities were 122° elevation (90-150°), 39 lateral rotation (20-60°) and medial rotation of T11 (T5 to sacro iliac joint). Open reduction and internal fixation of FGEPU may also be indicated for elderly patients and obtained 77.7% of good and excellent results. Statistically (p < 0.05), the anatomical reduction of the fracture was found to be important for obtaining good results.
