Chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are the leading causes of death globally, impacting heavily on the most vulnerable populations. This study aimed to analyze changes in the prevalence of these diseases, health conditions, access, and health services in Brazil between 2008 and 2019. Tests of differences and generalized linear models were used as analytical tools, considering complex sampling from the PNAD 2008, PNS 2013, and PNS 2019 surveys, to test temporal changes in the prevalence and the prevalence ratio estimates, adjusted by sociodemographic variables. An increase in the prevalence of Depression, Diabetes, Cancers, Neuropsychiatric Disorders, Chronic Pulmonary problems, and Musculoskeletal problems was observed. A decline in rheumatoid arthritis, chronic renal failure, and diseases of the circulatory system was identified. Among Brazilians with at least one NCD, an increase in coverage by the family health strategy over time was observed. However, there was a reduction in timely medical care and obtaining of free prescription drugs.
