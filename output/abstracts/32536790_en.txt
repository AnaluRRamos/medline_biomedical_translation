To compare the classification of CTS by the Phalen test with electromyography. Cross-sectional observational study. Patients at orthopedic outpatient clinic with carpal tunnel syndrome were evaluated by the Phalen test and compared with the result of the electroneuromyography. Sample of 33 patients, mostly women (87.9%). Most patients were already diagnosed with severe CTS by ENMG. The results of the Phalen test and the electromyography were equal in 26 of the 33 patients (78.8%). The Phalen test showed its applicability, since it had results similar to those of ENMG in most cases, especially in the most severe ones. The exam studied is a possible tool for the classification and recommendation of surgical treatment. <b>Level of evidence IV, Retrospective observational study</b>.
