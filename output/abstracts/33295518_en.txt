HIV infection is a predictor of several metabolic and body composition alterations, in addition to malnutrition, anemia, and hypovitaminosis. There are thus specificities of diagnosis and treatment depending on the stage of the disease and the outpatient or hospital environment. The scope of this narrative review was to update the conceptual and theoretical framework regarding the nutritional diagnosis of people living with HIV/AIDS. Current national and international scientific evidence published in scientific articles, recent books, protocols, consensuses, and guidelines were analyzed. The nutritional diagnosis encompasses several clinical aspects and abilities and specific knowledge about HIV/AIDS, such as: clinical history and current clinical situation, food consumption, anthropometric data, body composition, and biochemistry, blood pressure and physical examination. The nutritional diagnosis process was demonstrated in order to provide subsidies for the health teams in the identification of parameters that make it possible to establish a plan for nutritional care to promote, prevent and recuperate the alterations detected in people living with HIV/AIDS.
