Currently, resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) is used in trauma surgery for controlling non-compressible torso hemorrhages, as a less invasive option and with fewer physiologic disturbances compared with an invasive emergent thoracotomy for aortic cross-clamping. This can allow improvements in hemodynamic parameters until definitive surgery is performed. REBOA is also used in trauma to prevent hemodynamic collapse in patients who are in severe hemorrhagic shock, as a method to maintain perfusion of the brain and heart while decreasing distal bleeding until hemorrhage control can take place. The major complications reported are acute kidney injury, lower leg amputations, and even death. As experience with REBOA in emergency surgery grows, new indications have been described in the literature. The aim of this study was to assess the expansion of the use of REBOA in other areas of medicine, as well as evaluating the current published series. We performed an online search of PubMed, Medline and SciELO with the term 'REBOA' in the last five years, and the articles included were the 14 specifically describing the use of REBOA for non-traumatic conditions. The results suggest that the use of REBOA led to improved bleeding control and increased arterial pressure, reducing blood transfusion requirements and allowing patients to survive to definitive treatment of injuries. In conclusion, the expanded use of REBOA for non-traumatic emergencies appears to be effective. However, prospective studies and well-established protocols for specific indications should be developed to maximize patient outcomes.
