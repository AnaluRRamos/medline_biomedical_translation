Leadership is now-a-days recognized as the essential and indispensable support for the success of an organization, whatever it may be. Motivate and manage a group with a certain objective, can be interpreted as the art of leading people and how to lead them to achieve successful results in a natural, driven and motivated way. Leadership efficiency depends on the leader and must be started by defining a goal, selecting a group of stakeholders, guiding them, recognizing each oneÂ´s way of doing things, evaluating individual skills and obtain a target of excellence. The elements that make up a group are not usually and always selected by who will manage them and this can transform the role of a leader in a constant and appealing experience. The challenge is to explore and analyse the various problems, to focus on the goal by jointly assessing it, to recognize individual capacities and skills and to plan, negotiate and apply everything that can contribute to the success.
