Diseases of urachal remnants are uncommon and generally located on the junction of the urachal remnant with the bladder dome. In most cases such diseases correspond to mucinous adenocarcinomas and present hematuria as their most common clinical finding. The authors report the case of a 62-year-old female patient undergoing follow-up due to macroscopic hematuria for three years. Ultrasonography and computed tomography findings are described.
