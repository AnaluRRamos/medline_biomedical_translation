It is difficult to achieve proper alignment after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in patients with extra-articular deformity (EAD) because of altered anatomical axis and distorted landmarks. As of this writing, only case series have been reported with regard to the usefulness of computer-assisted navigation systems for TKA with EAD. This study therefore compared outcomes in TKA with EAD, with and without navigation. Fourteen osteoarthritis patients with EAD due to previous fracture malunion or operations were assessed. Seven TKAs were performed with navigation (navigation group) and another 7 were performed without navigation (manual group). Clinical and radiographic outcomes were compared before and two years after surgery. The mean postoperative Knee Society function score was significantly higher in the navigation group. No significant difference was found in postoperative range of motion and Knee Society knee score. The rate of outliers in radiographic outcomes tended to be lower in the navigation group. Better clinical outcomes were achieved in cases in which navigation was used. Computer-assisted navigation is useful in TKA for patients with EAD. <b><i>Level of Evidence III; Case control study.</i></b>
