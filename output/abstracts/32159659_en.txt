This article aims to analyze the completeness of the dengue fever notifications registered in a small municipality in Brazil, from 2007 to 2015. It involved a descriptive study with a quantitative approach, composed of the totality of records available in the National System of Notifiable Diseases. The absolute number and percentage of non-fulfillment of the key, mandatory and essential variables of the dengue notification forms were analyzed, and a score proposed by Romero e Cunha was used to assess the degree of non-completeness. The non-parametric linear correlation coefficient of Spearman (rs) was calculated, being preceded by the verification of the distribution of the data through the Kolmogorov Smirnov test. The proportion of information ignored was high for most of the variables and for some trends of non-completeness over the years were decreasing and statistically significant. The quality of the data was mostly classified as regular and very poor, making it imperative to establish strategies in the process of qualification of health teams that work in primary care, to raise awareness of the importance of quality in the registration of compulsory notifications.
