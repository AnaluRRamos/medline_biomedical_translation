The study presents empirical evidence of the personal and contextual variables that protect against the negative effects of stress on workers' well-being and health. A systematic review of the literature of the last eleven years (2006 to 2016) was carried out in the Ebsco, LILACS, SciELO, Google Scholar, and PubMed databases, and in six Annual Reviews journals. Fifty national and international articles related to stress and well-being were analyzed. The results show that work-related factors, personal resources such as resilience, self-efficacy, emotional competencies, psychological detachment, work-life interface, and group-level factors have effects on well-being. The perceived social support of peers and managers, alongside autonomy at work, attenuate the negative impact of stress on well-being. It ends with suggestions for future studies to test relationships between variables that have not yet been explored and to deepen the understanding of the relationships between stress and well-being at work.
