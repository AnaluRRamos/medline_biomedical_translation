Nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) is a brain area that plays a key role in kidney and cardiovascular regulation via baroreceptors impulses. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of naringin (NAR) and trimetazidine (TMZ) alone and their combination on NTS electrical activity and baroreceptor sensitivity (BRS) in renal ischemia- reperfusion (I/R) injury. Forty male Sprague-Dawley rats (200- 250 g) were allocated into 5 groups with 8 in each. 1) Sham; 2) I/R; 3) TMZ 5 mg/kg; 4) NAR 100 mg/kg; and 5) TMZ5+ NAR100. The left femoral vein was cannulated to infuse saline solution or drug and the BRS was evaluated. I/R was induced by occlusion of renal pedicles for 45 min, followed by 4 hours of reperfusion. The NTS local electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded before, during ischemia and throughout the reperfusion. Phenylephrine was injected intravenously to evaluate BRS at the end of reperfusion time. The data were analyzed by two-way repeated measurement ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test. A p-value <0.05 was considered significant. NTS electrical waves did not change during ischemia time, while they significantly decreased during the entire reperfusion time. NTS electrical activity and BRS dramatically reduced in rats with I/R injury; however, administration of NAR, TMZ alone or their combination significantly improved these changes in rats with I/R injury. The results showed that I/R injury leads to reduced BRS and NTS electrical activity and there may be an association between I/R and decreased BRS. In addition, NAR and TMZ are promising agents to treat I/R complications.
