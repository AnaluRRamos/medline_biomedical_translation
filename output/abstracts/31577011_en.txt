The scope of this study was to determine the food on offer in state public school canteens of Curitiba, Paran√°, and to investigate the association between the permitted/prohibited food supplied under the Canteen Law, with school and canteen variables. A cross-sectional study was conducted with interviews with canteen administrators in 27 state schools. The Mann Whitney test was used to investigate associations. There was a higher frequency of administration of the canteens under the self-management regime (n = 25, 92.6%); appropriate location in the school for serving meals (n = 20, 74.1%); length of time in administration of over 10 years (n = 13, 48.2%) and administrators who reported knowing the Canteen Law (n = 22, 81.5%). More than 2/3 of canteens sold prohibited food, such as sweetened beverages (n = 22, 81.5%) and candies, industrialized popcorn and salty snacks (n = 13, 48.2%). Only one school provided fried snacks (n = 1, 3.7%). The offer of technical education alone was associated with greater availability of food allowed by the legislation (p = 0.033). The school canteens evaluated can be described as places of commercialization of food not permitted by the Healthy Canteen Law. It is important to highlight the regulation and inspection of food sales in canteens for the promotion of health in schools.
