Memory complaints are common in adult people with epilepsy (PWEs). However, the associated clinical aspects are not yet fully understood. This study aims to relate the occurrence of memory complaints in PWEs with clinical aspects and self-esteem. To relate the data obtained from the Memory Complaint Questionnaire (MAC-Q) with clinical aspects, 71 PWEs were assessed using the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (SES), the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), and the Brief Cognitive Battery-Edu. These data were compared with 55 individuals in a control group (CG). Memory complaints (MAC-Qâ‰¥25) were significantly higher in PWEs, when compared with individuals in the CG [35 (49.3%) vs. 15 (27.2%); Student's <i>t</i>-test; p=0.012]. Objective cognitive performance was lower in PWEs. Memory complaints were associated with a lower educational level, the presence of depression, SES, MMSE, incidental memory, and the clock-drawing test scores in PWEs. Memory complaints were more frequent in PWEs than in individuals in the CG, and there was a relationship with cognitive deficit, educational level, depression, and low self-esteem.
