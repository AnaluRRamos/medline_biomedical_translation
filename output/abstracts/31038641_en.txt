to evaluate anthropometric and demographic indicators associated with high blood pressure in children aged 6 to 10 years in urban and rural areas of Minas Gerais. this is a cross-sectional study with 335 children. Anthropometric, demographic and blood pressure data were collected. The statistics analyzes were performed using the chi-square, t-student, Mann-Whitney and logistic regression tests, and the odds ratio was the association measure. the prevalence of high blood pressure was significantly higher among rural children. In the urban area, the chance of high blood pressure was higher in children who had a high body mass index (2.97 [1.13-7.67]) and in the rural area, in those who had increased waist circumference (35.4 [3.0-406.2]) and the age range of 9-10 years (4.29 [1.46-12.6]). elevated body mass index and waist circumference were important anthropometric indicators for high blood pressure, as well as age in children living in rural area. The evaluation of body mass index and waist circumference, in addition to nutritional assessments, represents an important action for the screening of high blood pressure in children from different territorial contexts.
