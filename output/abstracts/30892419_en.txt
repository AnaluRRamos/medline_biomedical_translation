To investigate the voice use of street artists from their vocal complaints, vocal disadvantage related to their profession, the perception of the conditions and the environment in which they use their voice, in addition to the role of the voice in their profession. Twenty-four street artists participated in this study. They all responded to two protocols: Vocal Symptoms Scale (VSS) and Vocal Disadvantage Index (VDI-10), and to two questionnaires: one with objective questions related to their working conditions and environment, and the other containing open questions regarding the meaning of the voice. Mean values of responses to both protocols were calculated. Frequency description and percentiles present the results of the questionnaire with closed questions. Analysis of the data from the questionnaire with open questions was done using the content analysis method. Mean values of the VSS were above normal limits, while the mean values of the VDI-10 were within normal limits. Some risk factors for vocal disorders were found, as the lack of use of the microphone and a dusty, smoky, and noisy working environment. Regarding the importance of the voice, two categories were identified: the need to care for their voice and the impact their voice has on people. There are vocal complaints among street artists, but no vocal disadvantage was found. The working conditions and environment are a risk to the artists' voice. The importance of the voice to the group is related to their professional activities, relation with the public, and professional and personal satisfaction.
