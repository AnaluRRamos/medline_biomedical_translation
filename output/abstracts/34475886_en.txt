In the current context of the aging of populations and the increase in multiple chronic conditions and dependence, it is important that health systems provide opportunities to improve capacities of older adults to enable healthy aging. Opportunities to enhance older adults' abilities, including self-management, can be offered through evidence-based programs. Such programs have been proven effective in improving individuals' symptoms and quality of life, often lowering health-care costs. Self-management evidence-based programs can foster the development of personal skills, increase confidence and motivation on self-care, and help individuals to make better decisions about their own health. This special report describes the implementation history of a self-management program in the Region of the Americas, and the barriers to and facilitators of implementation that can serve as examples for evidence-based program dissemination in the Region.
