To determine the workload in the Sterile Processing Department as a parameter for the method of nursing staff sizing. Quantitative, observational study conducted in four hospitals in the city of SÃ£o Paulo, in three steps: mapping of activities in work positions; determination of the standard processing time of materials; and establishment of the average daily workload. In the 15 mapped work positions, 1315 samples of time were obtained. As the time values did not show significant differences, it was possible to determine the standard processing time of materials. The average daily workloads corresponded to 217.4; 294.0; 123.1; and 189.1 hours. In addition to proposing a method to determine the workload, the present study indicates parameters for the processing of materials and serves as an important reference to develop consistent proposals for the planning, allocation and distribution of nursing staff in these departments.
