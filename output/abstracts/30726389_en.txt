Breastfeeding plays a fundamental role in the benefits for the health of the newborn child and the nursing mother. The use of medications during breastfeeding is a relevant issue, by virtue of the frequent need for pharmacological treatment in the postpartum period. The scope of this article was to conduct a review of the literature regarding the efficacy and safety of medications used during the breastfeeding period. A search was conducted in the PubMed (National Library of Medicine), ScienceDirect and Biblioteca Virtual em Sa√∫de (BVS) databases for articles published in Portuguese, English and Spanish in the period from 1981 to 2016. This review discusses the risk of the use of medications during lactation and the effects that they may have on the breastfed infant. Few medications are contraindicated and others require care due the risk of adverse effects on breastfed infants or in the suppression of breast milk volume. Therefore, the dissemination of updated information for the health professional to adequately assess the risks and the benefits of the use of medications during breastfeeding is of vital importance, thereby contributing to avoid early weaning.
