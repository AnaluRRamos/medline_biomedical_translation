To verify the effects of cognition on the benefit obtained with the use of hearing aids and on the quality of life of elderly people with hearing loss. 17 elderly people with moderate sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) bilateral were evaluated. The elderly people were divided into two groups according to the results of 10-point cognitive screening 10-CS: G1- seven elderly people without change and G2-10 elderly people with a suggestive result of cognitive alteration. Study protocol: self-evaluation questionnaire - (Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly (HHIE)), geriatric depression scale (GDS), quality of life questionnaire - (Short-Form 36 (SF36)) and evaluation of the listening effort through the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). After the evaluation, the elderly people received hearing aids. After three months of effective amplification, the protocol was reapplied with the inclusion of the International Questionnaire for the Evaluation of Hearing Aids - (IOI-HA). The sample was characterized according to age, schooling, Critério de Classificação Econômico Brasil Associação Brasileira das Empresas de Pesquisa (ABEP), degree of loss, Índice Percentual de Reconhecimento da Fala (IPRF) and Speech Intelligibility Index (SII) of the ear with better audibility. The statistical study revealed that there was significant difference only in relation to age. The comparative study before and after the intervention revealed a significant improvement in the 10-CS scores in the group G2, in the participation restriction - HHIE, in the listening effort and in some areas of the SF36. There was no difference in QI-AASI between groups second the factor 1, factor 2 and Total Score. There was improvement of the quality of life after three months of amplification use. There was no effect of cognition on the benefit obtained with the use of hearing aids.
