The aims of this study were to analyze the spatial distribution of dental caries among preschool children and create equiprobable scenarios of its occurrence in the city of Canoas, Southern Brazil. Trained, calibrated dentists examined 1,100 children enrolled at public preschools to determine dental caries experience following World Health Organization criteria. The ArcGis 10.0 Geographic Information System was used to analyze spatial and non-spatial data. Geostatistical Modeling Software was used in geostatistical analyses to detect spatial continuity and create maps using stochastic simulation. Overall prevalence of dental caries was 25% with intraurban differentials in distribution. The findings enabled the generation of 100 equiprobable scenarios and maps with the best and worst scenarios. The highest concentration of dental caries occurrence was found in the western portion of the city, while the lowest probability of occurrence was found in the northern and southern portions. Identifying spatial inequalities in health conditions and visualizing them through the creation of maps can help to qualify and organize public health interventions and provide information to gain better understanding of the influence of the surrounding environment on adverse health conditions.
