Since the beginning of the 20th century, social movements have developed isolated or aligned actions to promote the right of gays and lesbians to health. This article explores the participation of social movements in gay and lesbian health from the framing perspective on social movements. A literature search was performed and a frame analysis was conducted of the discussions found in the selected articles. This article therefore constitutes a bibliographic essay. With respect to outcomes, the literature reveals alignment between social rights and Aids activism, resonating in improved access to healthcare for gays and lesbians. We conclude that, although the participation of social movements in the struggle for the right of gays and lesbians to health started at the beginning of the last century, it cannot be said, now at the end of the second decade of the 21st century, that the outcomes were entirely solid. In short, we highlight that: (1) in some societies, the claims of social movements have been transformed into political agendas, while in others precarious concessions have been made in relation to gay and lesbian rights; and (2) non-acceptance of the right of gays and lesbians to sexuality still exists.
