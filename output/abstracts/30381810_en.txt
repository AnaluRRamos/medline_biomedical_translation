To assess the sexual function, anxiety, and depression of infertile women relative to a control group.  Infertile women (infertile group, IG) of reproductive age were invited to participate in this controlled study. A control group (CG) of women was recruited from the general population of the same city. Sexual function was assessed by the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), and anxiety and depression were measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).  A total of 280 women participated in the present study, 140 in the IG and 140 in the CG. The analysis of the FSFI scores showed that 47 women (33.57%) in the IG and 49 women (35%) in the CG had sexual dysfunction (FSFI ≤ 26.55; <i>p</i> = 0.90). Women with anxiety or depression had a greater risk of sexual dysfunction, and sexual dysfunction increased the risk of anxiety and depression. Married women had a lower risk of depression than single women who were living with their partners.  Infertile women had no increased risk of sexual dysfunction relative to controls. Anxiety and depression increased the risk of sexual dysfunction in the studied population.
