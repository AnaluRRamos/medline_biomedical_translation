The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the perception of dental care services and oral health conditions in a hypertensive and diabetic population subscribed to the Family Health Strategy in the city of Alfenas, Minas Gerais, Brazil. This was a domiciliary, descriptive-analytical study with random and stratified sample, consisting of 186 individuals. The following indexes were applied: Decayed, Missing and Filled Teeth (DMFT); Filled and Sound Teeth (FS-T); Dental Care Index (DCI); Evaluation of the use and need of dentures; Oral health for primary care assessment questionnaire (OHPCA). A predominance of women (67.74%), hypertensive non-diabetic people (58.60%) and elderly people (52.69%), with an average age of 64.26 (± 12.22) years, was observed. We noticed a total DMFT of 27.00 (± 6.24); FS-T = 8.94 (± 10.28); DCI = 19.42 (± 26.80); 39.78% of partial dentures usage, 56.45% of total prosthesis usage with necessity of 36.02% of partial dentures and 28.49% of total prosthesis. In the OHPCA questionnaire, positive assessments of services were prevalent. Oral Health proved to be best among those individuals who reported good relationship with their dentists and worse among those individuals who considered as good the equipment used in the services. The critical aspects were: access, speed and professional-patient communication.
