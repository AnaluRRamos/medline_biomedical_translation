Sustained high blood pressure can lead to vascular remodeling and endothelial cell injury, which may explain the endothelial dysfunction found in hypertensive individuals. Exercise training can improve vascular health in individuals with cardiovascular risk, but little is known about its effects in prehypertensive and hypertensive individuals. To review the literature showing evidence of changes in endothelial function in response to different modalities of exercise training in prehypertensive and hypertensive individuals. We conducted a systematic review of studies in the MEDLINE, Cochrane, LILACS, EMBASE, and SciELO databases following both the PRISMA guidelines (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) and the PICO framework (patient/population, intervention, comparison and outcomes). Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) published up to April 2019 were selected and assessed by four independent reviewers. The methodological quality was assessed using the PEDro (Physiotherapy Evidence Database) scale. Our search yielded 598 abstracts, and 10 studies were eligible for review. All of them had acceptable methodological quality by PEDro scale. Of the 10 studies, 7 involved aerobic training, 1 isometric resistance training, and 2 aerobic training and dynamic resistance training separately. Seven studies used flow-mediated dilation (FMD) to assess the vascular health, and three used plethysmography. Most training protocols involved hypertensive individuals and consisted of low and moderate-intensity exercise. Our systematic review showed that moderate continuous aerobic training is effective to improve vascular health in hypertensive individuals. In prehypertensive individuals, vigorous interval aerobic training seems to be an alternative to determine vascular health benefits. Resistance exercise training, either isometric or dynamic, can be used as a secondary alternative, but still requires further investigation.
