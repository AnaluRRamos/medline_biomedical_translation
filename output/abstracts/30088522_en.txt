to evaluate the characteristics of the patients with cutaneous melanoma treated at the São Paulo Hospital - UNIFESP. we conducted a retrospective study of 184 cases of cutaneous melanoma. We analyzed information on gender, age, tumor characteristics, histological characteristics and staging. mean age at diagnosis was 58.7 years, with homogeneous age distribution between genders and predominance in white individuals (70.6%). There was a predominance of trunk involvement in men (36.7%) and lower limbs in women (42%). Sun exposure, with sunburns, was more common among males (31.2%) than among females (23.5%). There was an approximately three-fold increase in lymph node involvement when the mitotic index rose from zero (11.9%) to one or more mitosis per field (36.2%). In addition, the greater the Breslow thickness, the greater the lymph node involvement and poor the outcomes: 10.2% when less than 1mm and 59.2% when greater than 4mm. the characteristics of patients with cutaneous melanoma treated at Hospital São Paulo are similar to those found in the literature.
