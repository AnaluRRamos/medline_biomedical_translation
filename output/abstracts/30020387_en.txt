The sundry circumstances that affect end-of-life care can have a determining role in the result of this experience, particularly in psychological morbidity levels before and after bereavement. The aim of this study is to describe the prevalence of psychopathological symptoms and overburden among family caregivers in palliative care and to identify the circumstances associated with care provision. An attempt was made to evaluate the progress of psychopathological symptoms, identifying circumstantial factors that can interfere in acute grief. The sample consisted of 75 Portuguese caregivers, mostly women and patients' daughters. The results show that caregivers more involved with patient care bear a greater burden and are more likely to manifest psychopathological symptoms, which persist in acute grief. Moreover, the existence of peritraumatic symptoms seem to contribute significantly to the overall state of distress in acute grief. Social support has a protective effect in the different symptomatologic situations and are closely related to family dynamics. These results suggest the possibility of early identification of the most vulnerable caregivers and the adverse circumstances that affect them.
