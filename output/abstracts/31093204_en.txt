To explore what is known on community-based food production initiatives (CFPIs) in Small Island Developing States, particularly the health, social, economic, and environmental impacts of and on CFPIs. This was a systematic scoping review using 14 electronic databases to identify articles published from 1997 to 2016 on the topic of CFPIs in Small Island Developing States. From 8 215 articles found, 153 were eligible and abstracted. Analysis focused on geographic location, typology, methodology, study design, theoretical frameworks, and impacts. Most research was conducted in the Pacific or Caribbean (49% and 43% of studies, respectively) and primarily focused on fishing and crop farming (40%, 34%). Findings indicate a predominance of research focusing on the environmental impact of marine and coastal resources on CFPIs, and very limited evidence of CFPI impact on human health, particularly nutrition and diet-related outcomes. There was a lack of explicit theoretical frameworks to explain the impacts of CFPIs. Evidence of impacts of CPFIs in Small Island Developing States is limited and the approaches taken are inconsistent. This review demonstrates the need and provides a basis for developing a coherent body of methods to examine the impacts of CFPIs and provide evidence to guide policy, especially as it relates to health.
