The increase in work-related health problems is a cause of concern for researchers worldwide. Intensification of work and the worker-work environment-illness relationship are some of the leading topics in debates on health and work. Facing this scenario, workplace physical activity (WPA) represents an option for prevention of work-related diseases. To describe and summarize how the Brazilian literature has addressed WPA. A scoping review was performed based on a search on the main databases of scientific articles available in Brazil using keywords 'ginástica laboral' (workplace physical activity), 'labor gymnastics', 'ginástica do trabalho' (workplace physical activity), 'exercícios laborais' (workplace physical exercise) e 'cinesioterapia laboral (workplace kinesiotherapy)'. Empirical studies conducted in Brazil and published along the past 10 years were included. The 44 analyzed articles applied variable, mainly quantitative methods to the study of WPA. The studies were most frequently conducted by physical educators and physical therapists. WPA was performed in both private companies and public organizations with employees who performed a wide range of functions. Six categories were detected for WPA: pain management; lifestyle behaviors; mental health components; components of human movement; quality of life; and anthropometric indicators and vital signs. WPA has been investigated through many different methods and involving variable modalities of application. While still scarce, qualitative and multi-method studies could certainly increase the reach and potential of WPA.
