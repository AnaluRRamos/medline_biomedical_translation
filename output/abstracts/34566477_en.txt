To characterize cases of land transport accidents in the macro-regions of city of São Paulo in 2005, 2010, and 2015. This is a population-based, longitudinal and retrospective study of time series, based on a quantitative survey of land transport accidents that occurred in the city of São Paulo in 2005, 2010 and 2015 using data from the Mortality Information System of the City of São Paulo. A total of 1,343, 1,567 and 1,088 deaths by accident recorded in the city' population in the years 2005, 2010 and 2015 respectively. The highest occurrences were in the age groups 15 to 24 years and 24 to 34 years. The highest number of deaths due to accidents was among males. The mortality rates observed in the macro-regions were South (23.8%), East (22%), North (21.6%), West (7.1%), and Center (3%). In comparing the years examined, there was a decline in the mortality rate per 100,000 inhabitants in most macro-regions. Despite the decrease in overall accident mortality in most macro-regions, it still deserves attention on preventive traffic actions focused on young males living in peripheral neighborhoods, since they represent the most susceptible group. <b><i>Level of evidence II; Retrospective Study.</i></b>
