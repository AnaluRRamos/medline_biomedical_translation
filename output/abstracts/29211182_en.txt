Hemoglobin variants (Hb) result from mutations in globin genes, with amino acid substitution in the polypeptide chain. Among the most common structural variants are HbS, HbC, HbD and HbE. The S hemoglobin gene is a high frequency gene across America and Brazil, where it is more frequent in the Southeast and Northeast. The scope of this article is to investigate the presence of hemoglobin variants in 15 quilombos (fugitive slave communities) of Piaui. The sample was of 1,239 people and hemoglobin was screened by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). A questionnaire was applied related to gender, ethnicity and consanguinity. Of the samples analyzed, 5.4% had AS sickle cell trait, while SS and SC sickle cell anemia showed a rate of 0.8%, with AC, AD and DD hemoglobin. Of the 1,069 Afro-descendants, 84 revealed hemoglobin abnormalities, 34 being male 53 being female. There were 13 consanguineous marriages among the 84 hemoglobin alterations. The study of hemoglobin variants in 15 former quilombo communities in the state of Piaui contributes to their education in health in the aspects of genetic inheritance of hemoglobin, a relevant public health issue, providing input for the implementation of the State Program of Sickle Cell Disease of Piaui.
