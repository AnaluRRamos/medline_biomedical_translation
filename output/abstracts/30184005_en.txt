This study aims to discuss Speech-language pathology (SLP) therapy intervention in dysphagia with a focus on palliative care and quality of life. It is a case study conducted with four participants with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis undergoing SLP therapy outpatient follow-up. The Swallowing Quality of Life Questionnaire (SWAL-QOL) and a structured interview were applied to the participants, who also underwent Videofluoroscopic Swallowing Study (VFSS). Participants were classified according to the Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS), the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Severity Scale, translated and culturally adapted to Brazilian Portuguese (ALSSS), and the Dysphagia Outcome Severity Scale (DOSS). Four patients showed interest in maintaining oral food intake, even if minimal, in the event of tube feeding. Regarding severity of dysphagia, observed in the SVF, the participants presented DOSS classification ranging from functional deglutition to mild-to-moderate dysphagia. The impact on swallowing quality of life was between discrete and severe. Not all participants presented correlation between severity of dysphagia and SWAL-QOL level of impairment, with impact on the quality of life observed even in cases of mild dysphagia severity. Participants reported that they would feel uncomfortable in the event of exclusive tube feeding, and that the oral intake of food, even if minimal only for the pleasure of eating, would have a direct or indirect impact on their quality of life.
