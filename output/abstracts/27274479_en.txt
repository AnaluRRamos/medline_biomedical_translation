To evaluate the results from surgical treatment of patients with mallet finger injury using a hook plate and screw. Twenty-five patients (19 males and six females) between the ages of 20 and 35 years were analyzed between May 2008 and December 2012. They were evaluated in accordance with Crawford's criteria and the mean follow-up was 18 months. The results from 10 patients (40%) were excellent and from 15 (60%), good. Twenty-one patients (84%) reported no pain, 18 months after the operation. There was no limitation to range of motion in 14 cases (56%), limitation of extension in seven (28%) and limitation of flexion in four (16%). Surgical treatment by means of open reduction and internal fixation using a hook plate and screw proved to be an excellent option for treating mallet finger fractures and was considered to be a safe and effective method.
