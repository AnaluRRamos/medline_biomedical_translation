To test whether wearable textile electromyography (EMG) recording systems may detect differences in muscle activity levels during daily activities between children with cerebral palsy (CP) and age-matched typically developing children. Wearable textile EMG recording systems were used to obtain leg muscle activity in 10 children with spastic CP (four females, six males; mean age 9y 6mo, standard deviation [SD] 2y 4mo, range: 6-13y; Gross Motor Function Classification System [GMFCS] level I and II) and 11 typically developing children (four females, seven males; mean age 9y 9mo, SD 1y 11mo, 7-12y) at rest and while performing seven daily activities. Children with CP showed significantly lower absolute EMG levels during maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) of muscles on the most affected side as compared to the least affected side and to typically developing children. None of the typically developing children or children with CP showed detectable EMG activity in resting situations. EMG activity relative to MVC was greater in children with CP during walking, jumping, and kicking on the most affected side as compared to the least affected side and to typically developing children. Wearable textile EMG recording systems may be used to determine differences in muscle activity during daily activities in children with CP. Children with CP showed reduced muscle activity during daily activities compared to their peers, but used a significantly larger part of their maximal voluntary muscle strength to perform these activities. Wearable textile electromyography (EMG) systems are feasible for measurement of daily muscle activity in children with cerebral palsy (CP). Children with CP showed reduced EMG levels during maximal voluntary contractions. Neither typically developing childrenÂ or children with CP showed EMG activity in resting situations. Children with CP used a larger part of their voluntary muscle strength during daily activities.
