Approximately 5 million workers are estimated to be occupationally exposed to welding fumes worldwide. Nickel and chromium are genotoxic metals found in welding fumes, therefore welders are exposed to these metals at the workplace. The objective of the present study was to investigate the frequency of cytotoxic and genetic damage in cells harvested from the oral mucosa of welders and also from a group of workers not exposed to metallic fumes. A total of 44 individuals, divided into 2 groups - welders and non-welders - were compared using the micronucleus assay technique and cell death (pyknosis, karyorrhexis and karyolysis) on buccal mucosa cells of welding workers. The examined cells were stained with Feulgen/Fast Green. <b>Results:</b> Welders exhibited higher frequency (p<0.05) of cytotoxicity than the group of volunteers not exposed to metallic fumes. The results of this preliminary study suggest that the frequency of cytotoxic damage in buccal mucosa cells might be higher among welders compared to non-welders.
