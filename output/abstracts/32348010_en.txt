Following the failure of the Fundão mine tailings dam in Brazil, approximately 32 million cubic meters of Fe ore tailings were released into the downstream riverine system. The postevent monitoring surveys implemented the use of noninvasive acoustic methods to improve the understanding of the fish biomass distribution patterns and aquatic habitat condition of the impacted reaches of the Rio Gualaxo do Norte, Rio do Carmo, and Rio Doce. The primary focus of the program was to collect hydroacoustic measurements of fish biomass, which was accompanied by sonar imaging of aquatic habitats using high-resolution side scan and downward imaging sonar at each site visited. The biannual surveys began in April 2017 and were fundamentally a multiple control-impact design because before data (prior to the dam failure event) were not available. Up to 22 sites were visited for each survey, including reservoir and river sites. Results indicate similar levels of instream habitat between control and impact river and reservoir sites. Average volumetric biomass was not significantly different between impact sites and their corresponding controls in the August 2018 survey (latest to date). Preliminary temporal analysis of the biomass data set collected indicates that either stable or increasing levels of biomass are detected at tailings impacted sites within the Rio Doce.
