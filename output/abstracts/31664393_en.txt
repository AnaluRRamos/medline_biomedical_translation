The objective was to establish cutoff points per gender for the evaluation of the fragility components of elderly residents in the community. It involved a cross-sectional population-based study with 555 elderly people enrolled in the Family Health Strategies selected by proportional stratified sampling. Socioeconomic data and the components of the fragility phenotype were evaluated. Regarding the classification of fragility, 17.7% of the elderly were fragile, 45.4% pre-fragile and 36,9% non-fragile. The cutoff points established for this population were: for hand grip strength, in men and women respectively with 0 < BMI < 23 was 20.30 and 13.36; 23 < BMI < 28 was 23.52 and 16.12; 28 < BMI < 30 was 22.04 and 15.17; And 30 < BMI < 50 was 25.42 and 17.51; For gait speed, for men with < height < 1.67 was â‰¥ 7.08s and height > 1.68 was 6.46s; And women with < height < 1.55 were 7.60s and with height > 1.56 were 7.45s; And weekly metabolic expenditure for men was 1,603.96 and for women it was 2,182.25. The results may support health teams to assess and stratify the risk of frailty of the elderly in the community and to subsidize the planning of actions to promote, prevent and recover functional capacity.
