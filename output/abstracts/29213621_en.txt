The working memory construct refers to the capacity to maintain information for a limited time. To devise stimuli and adapt the 5-back test and to verify the effect of age in normal Brazilian individuals. 31 healthy adults (15 young adults and 16 older adults) were evaluated by batteries of auditory stimuli to verify the inter-group differences (age effect) in working memory span, total correct answers and intrusions, and the intra-group effect of type of stimulus. There was no intra-group stimulus effect. Individuals from both groups processed di and tri-syllables similarly. No difference between groups (no age effect) was observed for any N-Back parameters: total score, span, number of intrusions, in either di or tri-syllable presentation. the processing capacity of 5 elements in phonological working memory was not affected by age.
