This study identifies and describes the changes introduced in Cuba's constitutional and legal framework, and the country's economic and social policy between 2015 and 2020, in terms of the effects on access to health. The conceptual map of public health and intellectual property in Cuba was also updated. A document search for the time period of the study was conducted in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Cuba and on the webpages of the Cuban Office of Industrial Property, Cuban government agencies, and the Cuban Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Industries group (BioCubaFarma). The updated conceptual map reflects amendments to the new Constitution of the Republic of Cuba adopted in 2019, updated guidelines on economic and social policy for the quinquennium 2016-2021, and laws, decrees, and legal provisions adopted in the period 2015-2020 in relation to intellectual property. The approved policy on the industrial property system was strengthened with specific legislation to protect industrial property, especially for the protection of the results obtained by the Cuban biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry. The changes reflected in the updated conceptual map favor interactions and synergy among the various actors that affect the Cuban population's access to health in the broadest sense.
