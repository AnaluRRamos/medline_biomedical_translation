Hypomineralized Second Primary Molars (HSPM) is the name used to describe the presence of demarcated enamel hypomineralization in second primary molars. HSPM has been compared with Molar Incisor Hypomineralization (MIH) as regards its clinical appearance and consequences. The aim of this study was to investigate associations between HSPM and dental caries in childhood. It was a cross-sectional populationbased study that included 216 children aged 4-6 years from public schools in Botelhos, Brazil. Children with all second primary molars erupted were eligible for participation. Clinical examination was performed by one calibrated examiner. HSPM was recorded according to modified European Academy of Paediatric Dentistry criteria. The main outcome was dental caries experience as indicated by the dmft index (%dmft>0) according to WHO criteria. Chi-square test and Logistic Regression Model were used to adjust the results for effects of covariates Among the 216 children examined, 22.2% presented HSPM. After adjustment for logistic regression, children with HSPM were found to have a 2.28 times greater chance of presenting dental caries. Our results reinforce the importance of HSPM in caries development in children, which should be considered by public health dentists in the process of planning actions aimed at this population.
