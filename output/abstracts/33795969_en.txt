To evaluate and collect epidemiological data on injuries of the anterior cruciate ligament of the knee in professional soccer players of the Brazilian Championship. Transversal study, with information extracted from the online data platform www.transfermrkt.com.br (Transfermarkt GmbH & Co. KG), with 5 seasons (2015 - 2019) of the Brazilian championship series A and B being analyzed and revised by 3 researchers. 52 injuries of the anterior cruciate ligament were detected, with a mean age of 26,3 years, time off due to injury of 244.5 Â±31.6 days, regardless of the division. Forwarders and defenders had the highest incidences of injury without statistically significant difference, but they had greater chances than goalkeepers, left/right backs and midfielders. The incidence of injury to the anterior cruciate ligament of the knee in professional football players in the first and second divisions of the Brazilian soccer championship between 2015 and 2019 is 0.414 per 1,000 hours of play, a value similar to described in the literature. The incidence of the injury varies according to the player's field position, being the forwarders and defenders the most injured players. <i>Level of Evidence II, Retrospective study.</i>
