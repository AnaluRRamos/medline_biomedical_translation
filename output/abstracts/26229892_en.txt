To evaluate the functional results from patients with surgical neck fractures treated with a locked metaphyseal intramedullary nail and angular stability. Twenty-two patients between the ages of 21 and 69 years were evaluated prospectively between January 2010 and January 2011. Their time taken for consolidation, age, sex, complications and functional results were correlated using the modified protocol of the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA). The mean time taken for consolidation was 9.26 weeks ± confidence interval (CI) of 0.40 weeks. One case (4.5%) did not become consolidated. There were no cases of infection. There was one case (4.5%) of adhesive capsulitis with good evolution through clinical treatment. Five patients (22.7%) presented occasional mild pain and one case (4.5%) reported medium-intensity pain associated with the subacromial impact of the implant. The mean score on the modified UCLA scale was 30.4 ± CI 1.6 points, obtained at the end of 12 weeks of evaluation: 18 cases (81.8%) with 'excellent' and 'good' scores, three cases (13.6%) with 'fair' scores and one case (4.5%) with a 'poor' score. In the group of patients evaluated, treatment of two-part surgical neck fractures by means of a locked metaphyseal intramedullary nail and angular stability demonstrated satisfactory functional results and a low complication rate, similar to what is seen in the literature.
