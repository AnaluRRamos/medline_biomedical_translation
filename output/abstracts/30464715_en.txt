The cause of anterior shoulder instability is not fully understood and surgical management remains controversial. The objective of this study was to evaluate the results of patients undergoing arthroscopic Latarjet procedure with endobuttons. A retrospective study of 26 patients undergoing arthroscopic Latarjet procedure with endobuttons to treat anterior shoulder instability. Patients with previous glenohumeral instability, failure of Bankart procedure or Instability Severity Index Score (ISIS) greater than or equal to 6, were included. Patients were assessed by: DASH, UCLA, Rowe, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) of pain and Short-Form 36 (SF36) scores. Correct position and consolidation of the graft were evaluated. Mean age was 31.5 years (16 to 46). Preoperative duration of symptoms was 1.7 years (1 month to 10 years). Mean follow-up was 14.3 (6 to 24) months. Mean postoperative scores were: 10 points in DASH; 1.6 in VAS, where 23 (88%) patients experienced mild pain and 3 (12%) moderate pain; 89 in Rowe; 32 in UCLA and 78 in SF-36. Positioning of the graft was correct in 25 (96%) cases, and was consolidated in 23 (88%). We had two cases of graft fracture (7%) and postoperative migration (7%). Surgical treatment using arthroscopic Latarjet with endobuttons is safe and effective, producing good functional outcomes in patients. <b><i>Level of Evidence IV, Case Series.</i></b>
