To report a rare case of dorsal brainstem syndrome in an infant after hypoxic-ischemic episode due to severe sepsis and the use of neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) to aid in diagnosis and in the removal of mechanical ventilation. A 2-month-old male infant, previously healthy, presented with severe sepsis that evolved to dorsal brainstem syndrome, which usually occurs after hypoxic-ischemic injury in neonates and infants, and is related to very specific magnetic resonance images. Due to neurological lesions, thei nfant remained in mechanical ventilation. A NAVA module was installed to keep track of phrenic nerve conduction to the diaphragm, having successfully showed neural conduction and helped removing mechanical ventilation. Dorsal brainstem syndrome is a rare condition that should be considered after hypoxic-ischemic episode in infants.
