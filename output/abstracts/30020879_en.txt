Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome is an encephalopathy that can be clinically characterized by headache, altered mental status and/or seizures. Neuroimaging demonstrates usually reversible bilateral subcortical vasogenic occipital-parietal edema. Exact pathophysiology remains unclear but is commonly associated with hypertension, renal failure, sepsis and use of immunosuppressive therapy. Its development in the setting of severe hypercalcemia is extremely rare. The authors report a case of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in a normotensive patient with severe hypercalcemia as the only identifiable cause.
