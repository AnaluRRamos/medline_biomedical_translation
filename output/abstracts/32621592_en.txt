The aim of this study was to compare the accuracy and precision of 3D printers used to obtain models of fixed dental prostheses. A fixed dental prosthesis preparation was scanned and reproduced by four 3D printers: RapidShape P40, Asiga MAX, Varseo, and Photon. The impressions were scanned again, and the dataset was compared to the original dataset. Mean discrepancies (µm) were 52.97±20.48 (RapidShape P40), 68.27±43.53 (Asiga MAX), 62.22±56.21 (Varseo), and 80.03±28.67 (Photon). There was no difference (p=0.314) in accuracy; however, the precision differed (p=0.015) among the 3D printers. The printers had distinct precision but did not differ in accuracy.
