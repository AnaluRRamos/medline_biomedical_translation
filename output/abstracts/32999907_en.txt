Mesenchymal tumors of the liver are rare, and in this group, myxoid leiomyomas are even rarer. So far, only 2 cases have been reported in the literature. We aim to report the case of a 16-year-old female with a large lesion on the right hepatic lobe, grossly composed of gelatinous and heterogeneous tissue. Histological evaluation revealed a benign mesenchymal neoplasm with expansive growth, paucicellular, with monotonous and dispersed spindle and ovoid cells, positive for Î±-smooth actin and h-caldesmon, without atypia or mitoses, consistent with the diagnosis of primary myxoid leiomyoma.
