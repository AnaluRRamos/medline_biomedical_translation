This article describes a case of multiple, recurrent, cutaneous inverted papillomas (CIPs) in a German shepherd dog, combined with a retrospective follow-up assessment of eight cases. A 3-year-old, black, female German shepherd dog presented with four rapidly growing, alopecic, domed, hyperpigmented, shiny nodules, compatible with CIP. The dog was managed for pruritus, associated with atopic dermatitis, with long-term prednisolone therapy and this therapy was continued after the surgical excision. Twelve months after the initial presentation the dog was represented for two new CIP lesions, coinciding with an increased dosage of prednisolone during an allergic flare-up period. Histopathological evaluation was conducted on both the original and subsequent lesions from the case with recurrence. Eight cases of CIP, based on histopathological findings, were identified retrospectively from the authors' diagnostic pathology service over the previous two years. All nine cases had lesions that exhibited varying degrees of inverted epithelial hyperplasia, multiple, endophytic, papillary epidermal projections, a cup-shaped base with central hyperkeratosis and active viral pathological findings (koilocytes). The submitting veterinarians were contacted and follow-up regarding recurrence and concurrent medications was obtained. CIP is uncommonly reported, typically as a single lesion with no previous reports of recurrence, although one group of dogs with severe combined immunodeficiency developed invasive malignancies. In seven of eight retrospective cases no recurrence of CIP was recorded. The authors speculate that the recurrence in the German shepherd dog may have been associated with chronic (although low-dose) glucocorticoid administration.
