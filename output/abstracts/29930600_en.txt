Anatomical variations of the celiac trunk and its branches are particularly important from a surgical perspective due to their relationships with surrounding structures. We report here a particularly rare variant involving absence of the celiac trunk in association with trifurcation of the common hepatic artery. These variations were found in an adult male cadaver. We perform a review of the literature and discuss the clinical and embryological significance of these variations. Recognition of celiac trunk and hepatic artery variations is of utmost importance to surgeons and radiologists because multiple variations can lead to undue complications.
