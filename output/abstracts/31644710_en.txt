To describe and compare the anthropometric measurements and the orofacial proportions of healthy term newborns (NB) according to sex, from a public maternity hospital in the state of Sergipe, northeastern Brazil. Descriptive and analytical randomized study was carried out. The participants included were 46 randomly selected healthy and full-term RNs of both sexes. A digital caliper was used to measure measurements (in millimeters) with the NB supine and occluded lips. Twice different, previously trained researchers measured each NB. Data were described using simple and percentage frequencies. The mean differences were assessed using the Mann-Whitney test, with a significance of 5%. Associations evaluated by the Fisher Exact test, and Cohen D size effects were calculated. Differences were found between the groups for the anthropometric measurements: midface third height (glabella-subnasal or sn-g) and bottom (subnasal-gnathion or sn-gn); and filter heights (upper-lip subnasal or sn-ls), the upper lips (subnasal-estomus or sn-sto), and lower (stomatal-gnathion or sto-gn), which was always greater in males. The orofacial proportions studied did not show differences between sexes. The study showed the presence of sexual dimorphism for the measures of the face at birth in the population born in Aracaju, Sergipe.
