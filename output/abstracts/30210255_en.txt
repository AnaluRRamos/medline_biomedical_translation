Adamantinoma accounts for less than 1% of the primary bone neoplasms. The tibia is the most affected bone and it is predominant in male patients between the second and third decades of life. The objective of this study is to obtain epidemiological and clinical information on patients with adamantinoma of the tibia treated surgically between 1989 and 2016. Retrospective series of seven patients diagnosed with adamantinoma of the tibia that underwent surgery at the orthopedic oncology service of our hospital. The information was obtained from the medical records and histopathological reports of our institution. A total of 2870 medical records with histological reports were evaluated. Seven cases of adamantinoma of the tibia were included. The mean age was 28.5 (17-49) years. We found a predominance of females (71.4%) and the most affected side was the left one, with four cases (57.1%). The biopsy revealed bone adamantinoma in four (57.1%) patients, while the diagnosis of the other patients was confirmed after the histological examination of the surgical specimen. All the patients underwent surgery as definitive treatment. No positive margins were reported. No local recurrence (LR) was reported and two patients had distant metastasis (DM). The prognosis of survival in cases of adamantinoma of the tibia is high. The rates of LR and DM were low. Surgical treatment with extensive tumor resection is the treatment of choice. <b><i>Level of Evidence IV, Case Series.</i></b>
