The objective of this study was to analyze and compare the effectiveness of two types of abduction orthotics used for the feet, the Denis-Browne type (traditional) and the Dobbs type (dynamic), with regard to maintenance of deformity correction and prevention of recurrence . In this comparative retrospective case study, information was collected from the medical records of children with idiopathic congenital clubfoot (CCF). We evaluated a total of 43 feet in 28 patients, which were divided into two groups. Group 1 was comprised of 16 patients with a total of 24 CCFs treated with the traditional orthotic device. Group 2 consisted of 12 patients with a total of 19 CCFs treated with the dynamic orthotic device. The statistical analysis used the ANOVA test to compare the categorical variables between the groups. A significance level of 5% was adopted (p-valueâ‰¤0.05) . In Group 1, recurrence was observed in 2 feet (8.33%), and in 1 foot in Group 2 (5.26%). No significant difference in effectiveness was seen between the two types of orthotic devices . Both abduction devices were seen to be effective in maintaining correction of congenital clubfoot deformities. There was no statistical significance between type of orthotic device and recurrence. Level of Evidence III, Retrospective Comparative Study.
