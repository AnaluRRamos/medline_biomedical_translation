The objectives were to analyze the experiences of survivors of maternal near miss based on the three delays model and to identify the obstacles to this process in the state of San Luis Potos√≠, Mexico. In 2016-2017, a qualitative study was performed with 27 women who had experienced maternal near miss in public hospitals between 2014 and 2016. The informants were selected with theoretical sampling and interviewed at their homes. Data analysis was based on the theoretical framework proposed by Strauss & Corbin. The categories associated with the first delay were: (1) missed opportunities for identification of maternal near miss; (2) failure of the women to voice their symptoms out of fear of reprimand; (3) dilemma between fear and the faith that a higher power will solve the problem; and (4) development of the perception of obstetric risk. The second delay involved: (1) lack of urban transportation infrastructure to access healthcare services; (2) lack of regulation of transportation costs; (3) lack of clarity on itineraries and critical routes to access care; and (4) lack institutional coordination for timely transportation. The third delay involved: (1) institutional refusal of care; (2) deficient infrastructure, personnel, and equipment; and (3) lack of expertise and experience in the healthcare personnel. The shared experiences reveal challenges for public policies and inter-sector work to improve the results in maternal near miss.
