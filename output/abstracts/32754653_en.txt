Community health agents (CHA) and endemics combat agents (ECA) play a decisive role in the prevention and control of dengue and are in direct contact with the population. To analyze the sociodemographic profile, activities and quality of life (QoL) of CHAs and ECAs in two towns in Parana, Brazil, in which dengue is respectively endemic (Paranavai) and epidemic (Paranagua). Cross-sectional study which analyzed sociodemographic and occupational parameters and the QoL of CHAs and ECAs in July and August 2016. Ninety-eight health agents were included, 40 from Paranagua and 58 from Paranavai. About 92.9% of the participants were female; their average age was 38.9 years old; 63.5% had completed secondary school; and 90% earned less than 3 times the equivalent of the minimum wage per month. The agents in Paranagua reported to feel they were better prepared for their job, although most considered training insufficient. Most participants reported to have already suffered verbal violence at work. Job dissatisfaction was higher among the Paranavai agents. QoL analysis showed that neither mental nor physical health was good, which might be explained by sociodemographic factors and professional exhaustion. Most participants were female, younger adults, with high educational level and low income. The training currently provided to combat dengue is insufficient, as most health agents felt insecure to convey information to the population. A part of the sample had already suffered violence at work. QoL was below the expected level, mainly due to work overload and low salary.
