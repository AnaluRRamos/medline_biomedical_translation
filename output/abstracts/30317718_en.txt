Primary mediastinal tumours with chest wall involvement represent technical challenges that may offer a survival benefit. Reconstruction with osteossynthesis material, bioprosthesis and muscle flaps is indicated to re-establish the excised component function. We report a case of a 30-year-old male with a primary mediastinal seminoma operated after chemotherapy with need for en bloc resection of the residual mass and manubrium with chest wall reconstruction. This type of surgery is rare and represents a technical challenge. Therefore, it should be performed in referral centers and with a multidisciliplinary approach.
