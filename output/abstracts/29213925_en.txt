We aimed to evaluate whether the Leganés cognitive test (LCT) correlates with global cortical atrophy (GCA) and can be used as a surrogate for structural brain damage. Atahualpa residents aged > 60 years identified during a door-to-door survey underwent MRI for grading GCA. Using multivariate generalized linear models, we evaluated whether continuous LCT scores correlated with GCA, after adjusting for demographics, education, cardiovascular health (CVH) status, depression and edentulism. In a nested case-control study, GCA severity was assessed in subjects with LCT scores below the cutoff level for dementia (< 22 points) and in matched controls without dementia. Out of 311 eligible subjects, 241 (78%) were enrolled. Mean age was 69.2±7.5 years, 59% were women, 83% had primary school education, 73% had poor CVH status, 12% had symptoms of depression and 43% had edentulism. Average LCT score was 26.7±3, and 23 (9.5%) subjects scored < 22 points. GCA was mild in 108, moderate in 95, and severe in 26 individuals. On the multivariate model, mean LCT score was not associated with GCA severity (β=0.06, SE=0.34, p=0.853). Severe GCA was noted in 6 / 23 case-patients and in 8 / 23 controls (OR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.14-2.81, p=0.752, McNemar's test). The LCT does not correlate with severity of GCA after adjusting for potential confounding variables, and should not be used as a reliable estimate of structural brain damage.
