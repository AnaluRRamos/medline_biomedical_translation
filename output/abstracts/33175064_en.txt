The scope of this study was to investigate the factors associated with blood pressure levels among pregnant women participating in the MINA-Brazil Study, registered in the Family Health Strategy in Cruzeiro do Sul in the Western Brazilian Amazon. Multiple linear regression models were used, adopting a level of significance of 5%. The majority of pregnant participants were less than 24 years of age, 44% were primigravidae, and 59.1% had excessive weekly gestational weight gain. The frequency of hypertension was 0.7%. Factors positively associated with systolic blood pressure levels in pregnancy were pre-pregnancy body mass index (β = 0.984, CI95%: 0.768-1.200), and weekly gestational weight gain (β = 6.816, CI95%: 3.368-10.264). Diastolic blood pressure levels in pregnancy were positively associated with maternal age (β = 0.111, CI95%: 0.002-0.221), maternal schooling (β = 2.194, CI95%: 0.779-3.609), pre-pregnancy body mass index (β = 0.589, CI95%: 0.427-0.751), and weekly gestational weight gain (β = 3.066, CI95%: 0.483-5.650). These findings stress the importance of the role of antenatal care to prevent hypertensive disorders during pregnancy.
