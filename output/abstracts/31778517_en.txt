This paper aims to analyze the use of health services by Haitian immigrants in Cuiabá, Mato Grosso. This is a cross-sectional study with a random sample of 452 Haitian immigrants in Cuiabá and Várzea Grande, interviewed between December 2014 and February 2015. Sociodemographic and health characteristics, lifestyle factors, and the use of health services were evaluated. Data analysis included Chi-square test and Poisson regression to investigate the factors associated with the use of health services. We found that 45.6% of respondents used some health service in Brazil, with a higher prevalence of use among women, those with higher income, longer residence time in Brazil, better understanding of the Portuguese language, and with poor self-reported health. The PHC Unit (UBS) and public urgent and emergency care were the primary services used. We conclude by saying that the SUS assisted the immigrants under the Brazilian constitutional principle of the right to health.
