The aim of the study was to learn about the parents' coping experiences regarding the mental suffering of their children. This is an ethnographic study. Data was analyzed through content analysis. Three categories have been identified: 1. Coping with everyday situations 2. Understanding of mental suffering as a life situation; 3. Fear of the future, feeling of social and governmental helplessness. Mental suffering imposes situations that need to be quickly resolved on families and arrangements in an attempt to balance the family system; family members coexist with mental suffering in the perspective of a chronic illness, and seek coping mechanisms for day-to-day situations; lastly they fear the future of their sick relatives and feel helpless due to public policies. Research is needed in the area to assess the impact of this issue on the lives of families, institutions and public policies.
