The aim of this study was to analyze the relationship between cognition and frailty in the elderly. A systematic review on the currently existing literature concerning the subject was carried out. The search strategy included LILACS, SCOPUS, SciELO, PsycINFO, PubMed and Web of Science databases. A total of 19 studies were selected for review, from which 10 (52.6%) were cross-sectional and 9 (47.4%) longitudinal, and the majority Brazilian. All of the studies established a link between cognition and frailty. There was a relationship between components of frailty and the cognitive domains. Risk of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), dementia and mortality were all evidenced in the relationship between frailty and cognitive impairment. The theory remains limited, but results show the variables that appear to be linked to cognition and frailty in elderly. This data can help in implementing actions to improve the quality of life among elderly.
