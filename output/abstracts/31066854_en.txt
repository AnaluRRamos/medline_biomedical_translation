This study estimated the costs of vaginal delivery and elective cesarean section without clinical indication, for usual risk pregnant women from the perspective of the Brazilian Unified Health System. Data was collected from three public maternity hospitals located in the southeast region of Brazil through visits and interviews with professionals. The cost components were human resources, hospital supplies, capital cost and overhead, which were identified, quantified and valued through the micro-costing method. The costs with vaginal delivery, elective cesarean section and daily hospital charge in rooming for the three maternity hospitals were identified. The mean cost of a vaginal delivery procedure was R$ 808.16 and ranged from R$ 585.74 to R$ 916.14 between hospitals. The mean cost of elective cesarean section was R$ 1,113.70, ranging from R$ 652.69 to R$ 1,516.02. The main cost component was human resources for both procedures. When stay in rooming was included, the mean costs of vaginal delivery and cesarean were R$ 1,397.91 (R$ 1,287.50 - R$ 1,437.87) and R$ 1,843.87 (R$ 1,521.54 - R$ 2,161.98), respectively. Cost analyses of perinatal care contribute to the management of health services and are essential for cost-effectiveness analysis.
