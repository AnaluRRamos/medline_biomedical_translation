This study investigated the association between consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and anthropometric and biochemical variables in a cross-sectional study conducted with secondary data from the first visit of the randomized clinical trial of the Brazilian Cardioprotective Nutritional Program (BALANCE Program) (2013-2014). Weight, height, waist circumference, lipid profile and fasting glycemia and a 24-hour diet recall were collected. Differences between consumption and non-consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages were evaluated by Student's t-test. The Chi-square test was employed to analyze the association between consumption and non-consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and biochemical and anthropometric factors. The sample consisted of 2,172 individuals, mostly men (58.5%), elderly (63.6%), C-rated economic class (57.3%), and overweight (62.7%). A statistically significant difference was found between the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and higher BMI values (p=0.029), waist circumference (p=0.004) and triglycerides (p=0.023). These results emphasize the need for nutritional intervention regarding the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages as part of the dietary treatment of this population.
