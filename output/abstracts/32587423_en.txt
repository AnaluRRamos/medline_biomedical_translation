To evaluate and reconstruct three-dimensional images of vascularization along the fallopian tube (FT), as well as to determine its relationship with the ovary and ovarian fimbria, and to quantify the blood vessels along the FT according to its anatomical segments, using confocal microtomography (micro-CT). Nine specimens (six FTs and three FTs with ovaries) were fixed in a solution of 10% formalin for > 24 h at room temperature. Iodine staining was performed by soaking the specimens in 10% Lugol's solution for 24 h. All specimens were evaluated using micro-CT. A morphometric analysis was performed on the reconstructed images to quantify the vascular distribution along the FT. In the FTs evaluated, the density of blood vessels was significantly greater in the fimbrial segments than in the isthmic segments (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The ovarian fimbria was clearly identified, demonstrating the important relationship between these vessels and the FT fimbriae. We believe that the vascularization in the fimbriae is greater than and disproportional that in the other segments of FT, and that the ovarian fimbria plays an important role in the development of that difference.
