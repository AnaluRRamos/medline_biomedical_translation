Define a legal framework for electronic medical records (EMRs) and determine the degree to which the countries of the Region of the Americas are prepared in this regard. The methodology consisted of two phases. In the first, a Delphi methodology was used to develop a questionnaire and define the framework and legal domains applicable to EMRs. In the second, the questionnaire was completed in each country. This included identifying national experts and the data collection process. Information was collected from a total of 21 countries regarding their situation with respect to legislation on EMRs in the following domains: 1) specific legislation on EMRs; 2) protection of patients' data and secondary use of the data; 3) legislation related to the actions of health professionals; 4) regulation on EMRs and the role of patients; and 5) health standards and EMR promotion programs. There has been progress in the Region with respect to new legislation covering the main areas related to EMRs (for example, protection of sensitive data and use of digital signatures). However, it is necessary to continue to address issues such as access to and updating of information in EMRs. This study contributes information on the essential components of legislation on EMRs, and reports on the situation in the Region of the Americas.
