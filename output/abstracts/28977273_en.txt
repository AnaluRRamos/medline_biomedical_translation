: In the pharmaceutical field, the development of new drugs requires sophisticated understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms in order to identify and characterize potential biomolecular targets and proceed with clinical trials. In this context, protection of research and development results is a vital stage for guaranteeing financial return on the heavy investments in the area. One strategy to achieve this objective is to exploit second-use patents, usually drafted in the format 'use of compound X characterized by the fact that it is used in preparing a drug for disease Y'. Considering the possible social impact and lack of specific guidelines in Brazil, this article reviews the principal cases related to dosing regimens in Europe and analyzes the positions of the European Patent Office (EPO) and German and UK judiciary systems on the requirements for patentability and scope of protection, aimed at contributing to the technical debate on the topic.
