Pelomedusoides had a recognised diverse Early Cretaceous fauna of turtles in Northeast Brazil. Within them, the bothremydid Cearachelys placidoi has a relatively abundant record. This diversity contrasts with the scarcity of osteohistological studies in this group. The relatively well-preserved shell of C. placidoi (UFRPE 5600), from the Aptian age of Araripe Basin, is studied here for the purpose of filling this gap. We performed the osteohistological description of the plastron of a new specimen of C. placidoi. Also, to conduct a comparative study, we carried out histological sections in bones of the recent chelid Phrynops sp. Our histological findings indicate similarities between the histological pattern of freshwater turtles and the coastal marine C. placidoi. Moreover, osteohistological features imply metaplastic incorporation of dermal interwoven structural fiber bundles. Lastly, the xiphiplastron of C. placidoi shows an increase of bone compactness over its craniocaudal axis. This microanatomical feature is exclusive to Cearachelys so far.
