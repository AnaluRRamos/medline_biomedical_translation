This study provided a systematic review on nonpharmacological interventions applied to patients diagnosed with Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA) and its variants: Semantic (SPPA), Nonfluent (NFPPA) and Logopenic (LPPA) to establish evidence-based recommendations for the clinical practice of cognitive rehabilitation for these patients. A PubMed and LILACS literature search with no time restriction was conducted with the keywords <i>PPA</i> (and its variants) AND <i>rehabilitation</i> OR <i>training</i> OR <i>intervention</i> OR <i>therapy</i> OR <i>treatment</i> OR <i>effectiveness</i>. To develop its evidence-based recommendations, a research committee identified questions to be addressed and determined the level of evidence for each study according to published criteria (Cicerone et al., 2000). Overall evidence for treatments was summarized and recommendations were derived. Our search retrieved articles published from 1995 to 2013: 21 for SPPA, 8 for NFPPA, 3 for LPPA and 8 for PPA with no specification. Thirty-five studies were rated as Class III, consisting of studies with results obtained from one or more single-cases and that used appropriate single-subject methods with adequate quantification and analysis of results. The level of evidence of three functional interventions could not be established. One study was rated as Class II and consisted of a nonrandomized case-control investigation. Positive results were reported in all reviewed studies. However, in order to be recommended, some investigation regarding the intervention efficacy was required. Results of the present review allows for recommendation of some nonpharmacological interventions for cognitive deficits following PPA as Practice Options. Suggestions for further studies on PPA interventions and future research are discussed.
