The purpose of this study was to analyze the impact of the implementation of the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) on the comprehension of instructions by children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This is a longitudinal study (NÂ° 0809/2018). The sample consisted of 20 children with nonverbal ASDs, 15 boys and 5 girls, aged 6 to 12 years, evaluated and diagnosed by a multidisciplinary team according to the DSM-5. For assessment of the comprehension of instructions, we used eight visual instructions and eight oral instructions, which were applied at two points in the PECS Implementation Program: early phases II and IV. The program consisted of 24 individual speech therapy sessions with the presence of a family member and followed the six phases originally proposed by the PECS Training Manual. There was an expressive increase in the comprehension of all instructions, in the comparison between the two moments of the study; and this increase was statistically significant in six of the oral instructions (p=0.001) and five of the visual ones (p=0.002). It was possible to observe the positive impact of the use of PECS in the comprehension of both visual and oral instructions, showing that this system not only provides an augmentative or alternative communication tool for the children to express themselves but also promotes significant improvement in the understanding of contextual information.
