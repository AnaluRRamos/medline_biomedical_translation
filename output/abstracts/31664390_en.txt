The scope of this study was to analyze the pattern of alcohol consumption among elderly Brazilians (60 years and over) and their association with sociodemographic factors, lifestyle habits and health conditions. This is a cross-sectional study of 10,537 elderly (90.1%) participants from the National Health Survey of 2013. The consumption of alcoholic beverages was classified as non-use, mild / moderate use and risk use. The multinomial regression model was used to study the associated factors. The prevalence for mild / moderate and risk use was 9.4% (95% CI: 8.4- 10.6%) and 4.6% (95%CI: 4.0-5.3%), respectively. The two consumption patterns were inversely associated with age and more frequent among men, better schooling, smokers and physical activity practitioners. Mild / moderate consumption was less frequent among non-whites and those with a history of stroke and diabetes, whereas risk use was less frequent among the elderly diagnosed for heart disease and more frequent among those suffering from depression. This result identifies profiles of greater vulnerability, with small differences between two patterns of consumption. This information should be considered in the preparation of proposals to promote healthy habits and control of alcohol use among the elderly.
