This was a comparative analysis on the quality of life of patients who underwent hemiarthroplasty of the hip, assessed before the operation and 3 and 6 months after the operation, by means of the SF-36 questionnaire (Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form health survey). A prospective study was conducted on 12 patients with femoral neck fractures who underwent partial hip arthroplasty between June 2013 and July 2014. Female patients predominated (58.3%). The mean age was 83 years and, in 91.7%, the fracture was due to falling from a standing position. The SF-36 questionnaire was applied before the operation and 3 and 6 months after the operation. With regard to physical health, the patients presented low scores for functional capacity and physical aspects. They had good scores for the subitem of general state and high scores regarding pain. Vitality, social aspect and mental health had moderate scores and emotional aspects had a low score. With the sample analyzed here, we can say that the hip hemiarthroplasty procedure for cases of unstable femoral neck fractures, in patients with low functional demands analyzed over a postoperative period of 6 months, does indeed allow quality of life to be maintained.
