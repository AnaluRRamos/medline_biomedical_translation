To determine the efficacy of Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis protocol in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA), and to verify differences in the rates of this complication when comparing primary replacement surgeries with revision surgeries. We conducted a retrospective study of patients operated between 2012 and 2018, with inclusion and non-inclusion criteria determined by the researchers. A protocol was created to compile data including 92 patients, amounting to 110 operated hips, divided by gender, age, laterality, among other criteria. For THA cases, low molecular weight heparin chemoprophylaxis was used, associated with the use of pneumatic and elastic compression, concomitant to deambulation as soon as possible. The detection of DVT was determined by clinical evaluation and imaging exams such as: simple radiographs, ultrasound, arterial and venous color doppler, and laboratory tests. The use of the protocol was very effective in our study. Only one (1.09%) case of deep venous thrombosis was found. The use of thromboprophylaxis for DVT is indispensable, as was clearly demonstrated by these cases. We observed only one (1.09%) case of DVT in our series. <b><i>Level of Evidence III, Retrospective Study.</i></b>
