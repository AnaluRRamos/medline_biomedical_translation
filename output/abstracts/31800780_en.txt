The study aimed to analyze the association between accessibility to public spaces for leisure activities, availability of equipment for physical exercise in these spaces, and leisure-time physical activity (PA) in adults. A household survey was conducted with 699 adults from 32 census tracts selected according to income and 'walkability'. Accessibility to public spaces for leisure activities was determined by geoprocessing according to proximity to public spaces for leisure activities and the amount of such spaces within radiuses of 500 and 1,000 meters around the participants' homes. Presence of equipment for physical exercise in these public spaces was assessed by the observation method and classified as: (a) without equipment for physical exercise; (b) with equipment for physical exercise; (c) equipment for physical exercise for adults; and (d) with three or more pieces of equipment for physical exercise. PA was self-reported, and walking was analyzed separately from moderate-vigorous PA, classified in two levels (≥ 10 minutes/week and ≥ 150 minutes/week). The amount of public spaces for leisure activities in a 500-meter radius with one or more pieces of equipment for physical exercise was negatively associated with walking (OR = 0.84, based on ≥ 150 minutes/week). The amount of public spaces for leisure activities in a 1,000-meter radius was positively associated with moderate-vigorous PA (OR = 1.03). The distance to a public space for leisure activities with three or more pieces of equipment for physical exercise (OR = 0.95) was inversely associated with moderate-vigorous PA. Proximity and amount of public spaces for leisure activities are associated with higher levels of moderate-vigorous PA in adults. The combination of methods can help reveal the contribution that access to (and quality of) public spaces for leisure activities can make to PA.
