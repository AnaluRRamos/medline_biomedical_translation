The scope of this study was to describe the frequency and types of meals consumed by the elderly in Pelotas (Brazil) and factors associated with the adequacy of meal frequency. A cross-sectional study was carried out with â‰¥60 years of age individuals. They were asked about daily meals during the week prior to the interview. The adequacy of meals was defined as recommended by the Ministry of Health (at least three main meals and two small snacks per day). The independent variables were sociodemographic, health and food routine characteristics. Prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using Poisson regression. Of the 1,438 elderly individuals interviewed, about 40% reported consuming four meals a day. Lunch was the most reported meal, followed by breakfast. A total of 30.6% of men and 38.6% of women had adequate frequency of meals (p=0.002). Men with edentulism (total tooth loss) were 35% more likely to eat adequately, while this probability was about 30% lower among non-white women, those without schooling and those who reported a lack of money to buy food. One in each three elderly people met the recommendation of adequate frequency of meals and some sociodemographic characteristics were negatively associated with this habit.
