To evaluate the prevalence of malnutrition in children under 60 months of age living in quilombo remnant communities of two municipalities in the state of Maranh√£o and their associated factors. This is a cross-sectional study conducted with a sample of 372 children in August 2015. Socioeconomic, demographic, maternal and child information were collected. The anthropometry followed the one proposed by the World Health Organization. Height-for-age and weight-for-height rates were calculated using Anthro software version 3.2.2. Poisson regression was performed with a robust variance for the association of malnutrition with the studied variables, using Stata software version 14.0. Child malnutrition was high for height-for-age (15.1%) and weight-for-height (7%). Children whose mothers had a short height (< 1.497 m) were more likely to have height-for-age deficits (p < 0.05). No variables were statistically associated with low weight-for-height. Child malnutrition persists as a public health problem in vulnerable regions, and maternal factors such as low maternal height may explain the short stature of the children. The need for actions to address this nutritional deviation is pointed out.
