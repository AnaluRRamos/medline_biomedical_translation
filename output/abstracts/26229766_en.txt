Select the studies related to knee surgery in the orthopedic literature published by Acta Ortop√©dica Brasileira (AOB) and the Revista Brasileira de Ortopedia (RBO) and classify them according to the levels of evidence. We selected all studies published from 2000 to 2011 related to knee surgery in AOB and RBO. The following categorization was adopted: level 1: systematic review; level 2: clinical trial; level 3: cohort studies and case-control; level 4: number of cases; level 5: narrative review and others. We found in the national literature selected 255 studies related to knee surgery. In the Southeast were developed 212 articles (83.1%), 30 publications in the South (11.7%), Northeast 5 (2%), North and Central West 2 jobs each (0.8%). Four work performed in other country (1.6%). The most common issue was the anterior cruciate ligament in 58 studies (22.7%) and arthroplasty in 55 studies (21.5%). Most studies presented evidence level IV (27.8%) and V (50.2%). The national scientific production related to knee surgery presents itself expanding with predominant expression in the Southeast. Most studies related to knee surgery published in national journals have low level evidence and focuses on the approach of the anterior cruciate ligament and arthroplasty.
