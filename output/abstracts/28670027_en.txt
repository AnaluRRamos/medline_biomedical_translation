To develop a simulator for training in fluoroscopy-guided facet joint injections and to evaluate the learning curve for this procedure among radiology residents. Using a human lumbar spine as a model, we manufactured five lumbar vertebrae made of methacrylate and plaster. These vertebrae were assembled in order to create an anatomical model of the lumbar spine. We used a silicon casing to simulate the paravertebral muscles. The model was placed into the trunk of a plastic mannequin. From a group of radiology residents, we recruited 12 volunteers. During simulation-based training sessions, each student carried out 16 lumbar facet injections. We used three parameters to assess the learning curves: procedure time; fluoroscopy time; and quality of the procedure, as defined by the positioning of the needle. During the training, the learning curves of all the students showed improvement in terms of the procedure and fluoroscopy times. The quality of the procedure parameter also showed improvement, as evidenced by a decrease in the number of inappropriate injections. We present a simple, inexpensive simulation model for training in facet joint injections. The learning curves of our trainees using the simulator showed improvement in all of the parameters assessed.
