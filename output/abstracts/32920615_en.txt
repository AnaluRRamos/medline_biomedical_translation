Melatonin (MLT) is a potential signaling molecule in the homeostasis of bone metabolism and may be an important mediator of bone formation and stimulation. The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of MLT on the viability, mRNA/protein expression and mineralization of pre-osteoblastic cells. The concentrations 5, 2.5, 1, 0.1 and 0.01 mM MLT were tested on pre-osteoblastic cells (MC3T3) compared to control (no MLT), evaluating proliferation and cell viability (C50), gene expression (RT-PCR) and secretion (ELISA) of COL-I and OPN at 24h, 48h and 72h, and the formation of mineral nodules (alizarin red and fast red) after 10 days of treatment. MLT at 5 and 2.5 mM proved to be cytotoxic (C50), so only 0.01, 0.1 and 1 mM were used for the subsequent analyses. OPN mRNA expression increased with MLT at 0.1 mM - 1 mM, which was followed by increased secretion of OPN both at 24h and 72h compared to the remaining groups (p <0.05). COL-I mRNA and COL-1 secretion followed the same pattern as OPN at 0.1 mM MLT at 72h of treatment (p <0.05). Regarding mineralization, all MLT doses (except 1mM) caused an increase (p <0.05) in the formation of mineral nodules compared to the control. Melatonin at 0.01mM - 1mM had a stimulatory effect on osteoblasts by upregulating COL-I and OPN expression/ secretion and mineralization, thereby fostering osteogenesis.
