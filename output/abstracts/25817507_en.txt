Rhinoplasty is a demanding task, especially when augmentation of the nasal contour is required. Autologous cartilage grafts are challenging. Contour and alignment of the graft are difficult goals. It is presented a case of a successfully nasal dorsum augmentation in a secondary rhinoplasty with the Turkish Delight technique and a brief review of literature. A 33-years-old female, with history of complete unilateral cleft nasal deformity on the right, and severe nasal deformity, previously submitted to other procedures, was referred to our Center. As she presented a visible cartilage graft, it was decided to perform the Turkish Delight technique. The autograft was effective for increasing of the nasal dorsum, at four years post-operative. There was no evidence of extrusion. The patient is satisfied with the result. The technique is effective in the reconstruction of complex dimorphism of the nasal dorsum, particularly in secondary rhinoplasty.
