There are no specific criteria that define the level of amputation in diabetic patients. The objective of this study was to assess the influence of clinical and laboratory parameters in determining the level of amputation and the wound healing time. One hundred and thirty-nine diabetic patients were retrospectively assessed. They underwent surgical procedures due to infection and/or ischemic necrosis. Type of surgery, antibiotic use, laboratory parameters and length of hospital stay were evaluated in this study. The most common amputation level was transmetatarsal, occurring in 26 patients (28.9%). The wound healing time increased with statistical significance in individuals undergoing debridement, who did not receive preoperative antibiotics and did not undergo vascular intervention. Higher levels of amputation were statistically related to limb ischemia, previous amputation and non-use of preoperative antibiotics. Patients with minor amputations undergo stump revision surgery more often, but the act of always targeting the most distal stump possible decreases energy expenditure while walking, allowing patients to achieve better quality of life. Risk factors for major amputations were ischemia and previous amputations. A protective factor was preoperative antibiotic therapy. <i><b>Level of Evidence III, Retrospective Study.</b></i>
