To compare the outcomes of the fixation of complete and displaced supracondylar humeral fractures in children with two different Kirschner wire configurations. The type of fixation was randomized to either crossed (19 cases), or two divergent lateral Kirschner wires (24 cases). The comparison was made six months later between the two treated groups and each group with the non-fractured elbow (clinical alignment, range of motion, Baumann angle, and lateral humeral capitellar angle). 43 children were evaluated (65% boys) with a mean age of six years and five months. The carrying angle (p = 0.94), extension (p = 0.89), and the FlynnÂ´s criteria (p = 0.56) were similar between the groups. The flexion was slightly smaller for the crossed wire group (p = 0.04), but similar to the uninjured side. The Baumann angle was not different between the two fixations (p = 0.79) and the contralateral side (p = 0.1). The lateral humeral capitellar angle was slightly greater for the lateral pinning (p = 0.08), but with no difference with the uninjured elbow (p = 0.62). No iatrogenic injuries were observed. Both fixations presented similar outcomes that did not significantly affect the carrying angle in relation to the non-fractured side. <b><i>Level of evidence II, Therapeutic study - Investigating the results of treatment.</i></b>
