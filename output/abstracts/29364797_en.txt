This study aimed to compare the analgesic efficacy and the influence of local infiltrative anesthesia techniques, with diploe anesthesia, on the cardiac rhythmMaterial and Methods: We selected 32 healthy volunteers who were given both anaesthetic techniques on tooth 1.4 (0.45 mL of lidocaine with adrenaline, 1:80 000). In the first phase, the volunteers underwent periapical infiltrative anaesthesia. In the second phase, diploe anaesthesia was performed with a QuickSleeper® device. The parameters analysed were pulp response to the electrical test and heart rate of the participants. These parameters were evaluated on five different occasions: before anaesthesia (t0), immediately after anaesthesia (t1), 15 minutes later (t15), 30 minutes later (t30) and 60 minutes later (t60). Statistical analysis of the data was performed using SPSS 2.0 software, with α = 0.05. With the diploe anaesthesia, a level of analgesia was obtained faster. There was a slight increase in heart rate soon after administration of diploe anaesthesia, which stabilized after t15 of the procedure. This technique still proved to be painless. Diploe anaesthesia demonstrated better results in terms of analgesia than the infiltrative anaesthesia. It has been reported to be easy, safe and an effective procedure that allows anaesthesia in almost all clinical situations. This approach may offer particular advantages for endodontic therapy, providing greater comfort for the patient.
