To describe the technique of injecting hemostatic matrix, as well as the experience of our interventional radiology department in its application. We conducted a single-center study with retrospective analysis of the experience of our group in the use of hemostatic gelatin matrix in percutaneous biopsies. In a total of 73 biopsies in different organs, such as the liver, kidney, and spleen, hemostatic gelatin matrix was introduced into the coaxial needle. The only complication observed was migration of the hemostatic matrix to the left kidney collecting system, and that was resolved with clinical treatment. There were no cases of bleeding after the injection of hemostatic matrix. The use of hemostatic matrices in the path of percutaneous biopsies is another tool available for consideration in minimally invasive procedures.
