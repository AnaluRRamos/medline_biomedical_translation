The aim of this study was to verify whether the perception of neighborhood physical and social disorder is associated with increased systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), as well as to examine the influence of the residential census tract's socioeconomic status on this association. This was a cross-sectional study that included a representative sample of 1,720 adults 20 to 59 years of age living in Florian√≥polis, Santa Catarina State, Brazil. Two blood pressure measurements were taken, and information was collected on the perception of neighborhood disorder. The contextual variable was the mean head-of-household's years of schooling in the selected census tracts. Statistical analysis included multilevel models with the first level represented by individuals and the second by census tracts. Interaction terms were examined between schooling tertiles in the census tract and tertiles of perception of neighborhood disorder on blood pressure. No statistically significant overall associations were identified between neighborhood disorder and SBP or DBP. However, the study showed a mean increase in SBP of 7.88mmHg (95%CI: 1.38; 14.40) in subjects that perceived more neighborhood disorder and lived in census tracts with less schooling, when compared to the reference category. Public policies aimed at lowering or that have an impact on SBP and DBP in the population should also address the characteristics of the context where the population lives, specifically in contexts marked by lower levels of schooling.
