this study aimed to evaluate the fixation of the trabecular metal wedge in patients undergoing revision of total hip arthroplasty. twenty-three cases with minimum grading of Paprosky II-B that were operated between July 2008 and February 2013 were evaluated. These cases were evaluated based on radiographs before the operation, immediately after the operation and later on after the operation. Loss of fixation was defined as a change in the abduction angle of the component greater than 10° or any mobilization greater than 6 mm. it was found that there was 100% fixation of the acetabula after a mean of 29.5 months. One case underwent removal of the implanted components due to infection. there is still no consensus regarding the best option for reconstructing hips with bone loss. However, revision using a trabecular metal wedge has presented excellent short- and medium-term results. This qualifies it as an important tool for achieving a fixed and stable acetabular component.
