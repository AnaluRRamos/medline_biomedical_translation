There is great optimism that artificial intelligence (AI), as it disrupts the medical world, will provide considerable improvements in all areas of health care, from diagnosis to treatment. In addition, there is considerable evidence that AI algorithms have surpassed human performance in various tasks, such as analyzing medical images, as well as correlating symptoms and biomarkers with the diagnosis and prognosis of diseases. However, the mismatch between the performance of AI-based software and its clinical usefulness is still a major obstacle to its widespread acceptance and use by the medical community. In this article, three fundamental concepts observed in the health technology industry are highlighted as possible causative factors for this gap and might serve as a starting point for further evaluation of the structure of AI companies and of the status quo.
