The aim of this study was to evaluate the intake of ultra-processed foods and associated factors in prepubertal children. It is a cross-sectional study with 378 children aged 8 and 9 years enrolled in public and private schools in Viçosa-MG. Food intake was assessed by three 24-hour dietary recalls. Dietary data were entered into the Diet Pro® 5i software to quantify energy intake. The Two-Step Cluster technique was used to analyze food consumption groups, with the Stata 13 software package. The foods were grouped and classified as 'healthy' and 'unhealthy' eating markers. The association between the sociodemographic variables and the groups formed was examined by Poisson Regression. Two food groups were formed: 'healthy' and 'unhealthy'. The caloric intake of ultra-processed foods was lower in the 'healthy' group (20.5%) than in the 'unhealthy' group (24.1%; P = 0.043). The multivariate model showed that private school children (PR = 1.25, P <0.001), who did not receive Bolsa Familia (PR = 1.13, P = 0.036) and had working mothers (PR = 1.38, P <0.001) had increased probability of unhealthy food consumption. Ultra-processed food intake was associated with greater purchasing power of families of prepubertal children.
