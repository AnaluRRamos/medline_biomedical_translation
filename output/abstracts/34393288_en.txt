To establish the diagnostic performance of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) in discriminating malignant from non-malignant thoracic lymph nodes. This was a meta-analysis involving systematic searches of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases up through April 2020. Studies reporting thoracic DWI and lymph node evaluation were included. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were calculated. We evaluated six studies, involving a collective total of 356 mediastinal lymph nodes in 214 patients. Thoracic DWI had a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 92% (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 71-98%) and 93% (95% CI: 79-98%), respectively. The positive and negative likelihood ratios were 13.2 (95% CI: 4.0-43.8) and 0.09 (95% CI: 0.02-0.36), respectively. The diagnostic odds ratio was 149 (95% CI: 18-1,243), and the AUC was 0.97 (95% CI: 0.95-0.98). DWI is a reproducible technique and has demonstrated high accuracy for differentiating between malignant and benign states in thoracic lymph nodes.
