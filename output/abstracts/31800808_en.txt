To verify the reliability and viability estimates of using the translated and adapted version of the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory-20 for use in Brazil in patients with chronic coronary artery disease. A methodological study. The instrument was answered by the participants without the help of the researchers. Filling time was recorded, and facilities and difficulties were documented. The viability of use was analyzed through acceptability, practicality, ceiling and floor effects. Reliability was estimated by internal consistency. The sample consisted of 201 participants. The mean fatigue score was 51.9 + 14.0. There was a small rate of unanswered items (0.65%), although 30.3% of participants requested some clarification after reading the instructions; 37.3% reported that they had doubts when answering the items, especially number 19. The response time was 4.8 + 1.9 minutes. There were no ceiling or floor effects. The reliability estimate was adequate. The instrument needs adjustments to the wording of the instructions and some items, although it has good acceptability and reliability estimates.
