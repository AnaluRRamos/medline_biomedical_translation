Since December 2019 we have observed the rapid advance of the severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The impact of the clinical course of a respiratory infection is little known in patients with hereditary arrhythmias, due to the low prevalence of these diseases. Patients who present with infectious conditions may exacerbate hidden or well-controlled primary arrhythmias, due to several factors, such as fever, electrolyte disturbances, drug interactions, adrenergic stress and, eventually, the septic patientâ€™s own myocardial damage. The aim of this review is to highlight the main challenges we may encounter during the Covid 19 pandemic, specifically in patients with hereditary arrhythmias, with emphasis on the congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS), Brugada syndrome (SBr), ventricular tachycardia polymorphic catecholaminergic (CPVT) and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy.
