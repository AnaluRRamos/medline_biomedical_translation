To determine the physical violence profile against lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transvestites and transsexuals (LGBTT). Descriptive study, with a quantitative approach, carried out with sexual minorities of the municipalities of Juazeiro do Norte and Crato, Cear√°, Brazil. A structured form was used to collect data. The study was previously approved by a Research Ethics Committee. 316 LGBTT members, mostly gays, single, mestizo and with a mean age of 24.3 years, took part in the study. Among the types of violence suffered throughout life, physical violence ranked second (31.3%); in this category, pushes (21.8%) and hits (17.4%) prevailed. The preferred place for attacks was the face (84.4%), and most of the aggressors are unknown persons (13.6%). LGBTT victimization is a serious violation of human rights, with negative repercussions on health. The results point to a picture of social homophobia, similar to that observed across the Brazilian territory through reports published by the Secretariat for Human Rights of the Presidency of the Republic. Sexual minorities are victims of routine attacks that result in temporary and/or permanent sequels, such as torsions and fractures. The threat of attack is constant, since the major attackers are unknown bystanders. The LGBTT community is victim of physical violence and its negative repercussions. The confrontation of this reality implies the elaboration of political and social strategies, from governmental and non-governmental sectors, in order to counteract and reduce this type of violence directed to this group.
