To describe the observed behavior of professionals in two neonatal and pediatric intensive care units regarding the use of central venous catheter insertion bundle, and the clinical and birth profile of neonates and children who received the devices. A quantitative descriptive exploratory study was conducted in two intensive care units of a public hospital in Belo Horizonte with neonates and children, between February and September 2016. The sample consisted of 59 observed implants of central venous catheter. Most patients were male preterm infants, of cesarean delivery and proper weight according to the gestational age. Among all procedures observed, only three followed all recommendations for the central venous catheter insertion bundle. Incorrect techniques were observed while performing surgical antisepsis and inadequate use of chlorhexidine, an antiseptic. The findings highlight the importance of more investment in continuous training of the team on the prevention of bloodstream infection caused by central venous catheter to reduce the number of adverse events related to intravenous therapy.
