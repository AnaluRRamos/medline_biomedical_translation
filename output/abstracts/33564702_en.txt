Abdominal pain related to pancreatic disease is often extremely disabling. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided celiac plexus block (CPB) is used to control pain associated with chronic pancreatitis. EUS-guided celiac plexus neurolysis (CPN) is typically used to reduce pain associated with pancreatic cancer and can be considered early at the time of diagnosis of inoperable disease. EUS-guided celiac plexus interventions have been shown to be significantly effective in pancreatic pain relief, which is achieved in approximately 70-80% of patients with pancreatic cancer and in 50-60% of those with chronic pancreatitis. Serious complications from CPB and CPN are rare. Most frequent adverse events are diarrhoea, orthostatic hypotension, and a transient increase in abdominal pain. In this article, the Portuguese Group for Ultrasound in Gastroenterology (GRUPUGE) presents an updated perspective of the potential role of EUS-guided celiac plexus interventions, addressing the selection criteria and technical issues of different techniques and analysing recent data on their safety and efficacy.
