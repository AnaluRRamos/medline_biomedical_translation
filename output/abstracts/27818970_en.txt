To analyze factors associated with mortality among elderly people hospitalized in a single-center regional hospital due to femoral fractures. This was a retrospective cohort study. Patients aged 60 years or over who were hospitalized with a diagnosis of femoral fracture (ICD S72) between 2008 and 2013 were selected through the electronic medical records. The study evaluated 195 individuals of mean age 78.5 ± 9.6 years; females predominated (68.2%). The main mechanism for falls was low-energy (87.2%). Surgery was performed on 93.3% of the patients; the mean length of hospital stay was 13.6 ± 7.5 days and the mean waiting time for the surgery was 7.7 ± 4.2 days. The prevalence of mortality was 14.4%, and this occurred mostly among older individuals (<i>p</i> = 0.029); patients with leukocytosis (<i>p</i> < 0.001); those who needed intensive care (<i>p</i> < 0.001); and those who did not undergo surgery (<i>p</i> < 0.001). The mean survival was significantly longer among patients who underwent surgery and shorter among those who needed intensive care. Women predominated among the hospitalizations, and the degree of leukocytosis associated with advanced age presented a relationship with mortality, independent of the type of lesion or surgical procedure. More studies still need to be conducted in order to assess other factors associated with mortality.
