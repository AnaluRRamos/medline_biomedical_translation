Infection after the internal fixation of fractures is a major complication. Early infection is particularly challenging, because it occurs when the fracture is not yet united. The objective of this study is to identify possible factors related to the development of early infection in patients treated with internal fixation for fractures. This retrospective observational study analyzed 24 patients with long bone fractures who underwent internal fixation and developed infections in the post-operatory period. The infections were classified as early (diagnosis in the first two weeks after surgery) or late (diagnosis after 2 weeks). Of the 24 patients studied, 11 (46%) developed early infections and 13 (54%) were diagnosed with late infections. The early infection group was significantly younger (37.8 versus 53.1 [p = 0.05]) and underwent more surgeries prior to internal fixation (1.2 versus 0.2 [p < 0.00]). Risk factors for the development of early infection in the postoperative period should be considered when treating patients with internal fracture fixation in order to diagnose this condition as early as possible. Level of Evidence IV; Case series.
