To define the list of priority congenital anomalies for improving their recording on the Brazilian Live Birth Information System (Sinasc). Based on the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), international protocols and meetings with specialists, the list of priority anomalies was built considering two main criteria: being diagnosable at birth and having intervention available at different levels. The list was submitted for consideration by the Brazilian Medical Genetics and Genomics Society. The list comprised eight groups of congenital anomalies distributed according to the type of related anomaly, as well as the affected part of the body and its corresponding code in ICD-10 Chapter XVII. The list of priority congenital anomalies for notification provides a basis for improving case recording on Sinasc.
