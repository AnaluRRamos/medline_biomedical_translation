The aim of this study was to evaluate the precision and accuracy of molds made with four commercial brands of alginate scanned at different times using digital model analysis. Eighty molds of a standard Typodont were made using 4 types of alginate (CCC: Cavex Color Change; IA: Identic Alginate; HY5: Hydrogum 5 and JP: Jeltrate Plus). The molds were scanned at four times: immediately (T1), 24h (T2), 72h (T3) and 120h (T4) after molding. Measurements were taken in three dimensions: anteroposterior, transverse and vertical. Significant differences in dimensional changes were noted between the materials over time (p <0.05). Anteroposterior dimensional variation was noted between times, especially for IA and JP. For transverse and vertical variables, a difference was found between the groups, especially at 24 h, 72 h and 120 h. CCC presented significant dimensional shrinkage only at T120 (transverse). IA and JP presented larger dimensional distortions in the vertical measurements. The molding materials used were not dimensionally stable when evaluated after 120 hours of molding. However, such evidence suggests that alginates with longer storage time, such as Cavex Color Change, are more accurate than conventional alginates.
