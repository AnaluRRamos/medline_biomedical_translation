The logopenic variant of Primary Progressive Aphasia, or logopenic aphasia, is a the most recently described variant of Primary Progressive Aphasia and also the least well defined. This variant can present clinical findings that are also common to Alzheimer's disease, given they both share the same cytopathologic findings. This article reports the clinical case of a patient for whom it proved difficult to define a clinical diagnosis, being split between the logopenic variant and Alzheimer's disease at different phases of the disease. Using this case as an example and drawing on the latest evidence from the literature on the logopenic variant, we postulate the hypothesis that this variant may present as an initial symptom of Alzheimer's disease in some atypical cases.
