To evaluate the degree of similarity between manual and semiautomatic segmentation of soft-tissue sarcomas on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This was a retrospective study of 15 MRI examinations of patients with histopathologically confirmed soft-tissue sarcomas acquired before therapeutic intervention. Manual and semiautomatic segmentations were performed by three radiologists, working independently, using the software 3D Slicer. The Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and the Hausdorff distance were calculated in order to evaluate the similarity between manual and semiautomatic segmentation. To compare the two modalities in terms of the tumor volumes obtained, we also calculated descriptive statistics and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). In the comparison between manual and semiautomatic segmentation, the DSC values ranged from 0.871 to 0.973. The comparison of the volumes segmented by the two modalities resulted in ICCs between 0.9927 and 0.9990. The DSC values ranged from 0.849 to 0.979 for intraobserver variability and from 0.741 to 0.972 for interobserver variability. There was no significant difference between the semiautomatic and manual modalities in terms of the segmentation times (<i>p</i> > 0.05). There appears to be a high degree of similarity between manual and semiautomatic segmentation, with no significant difference between the two modalities in terms of the time required for segmentation.
