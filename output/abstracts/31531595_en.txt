To identify aspects that hinder or facilitate the work of nurses in primary health care when disclosing difficult news. Qualitative, descriptive and exploratory study addressing 15 nurses from ten primary health care units located in the south of Brazil. Data were collected from February to April 2017, using a semi-structured interview. Interviews were audio-recorded and analyzed based on discourse analysis. The aspects that hinder communication include the demand for services; work organization; the characteristics of patients; and personal aspects. Facilitating aspects include privacy and being in the community. Also hindering or facilitating communication: the way the network functions and the staff; academic training; professional experience; personal aspects. This topic is seldom addressed during academic training and this lack of preparedness is one of the main barriers hindering the disclosure of difficult news. Hence, it is essential that teaching institutions establish a discussion regarding this topic.
