To qualitatively assess surgeries performed in patients with perilunate dislocations without associated fractures, who were operated using the closed reduction and percutaneous fixation method. The follow-up time ranged from one to seven years. 628 patient records with traumatic wrist injuries, operated by the same group of Hand Surgeons between 2008 and 2014 due to acute trauma were collected, with a mean follow-up of 3.2 years. Of these, 51 were cases of perilunate fracture-dislocations, and 38 were pure perilunate dislocations without associated fractures; of these, only 32 underwent percutaneous fixation without ligamentous repair, thus meeting the inclusion criteria. Of the nine patients with perilunate dislocations who were treated using the closed reduction and percutaneous fixation method, whose mean age was 38 years (range 26-49 years), the dominant side was the left in two-thirds of the cases, and the predominant trauma mechanism was direct trauma. This study is in agreement with the literature, showing that cases treated early present good results. 88% of patients who were treated by closed reduction and percutaneous fixation method maintained their daily activities and were assessed as excellent or good by the Clinical Scoring Chart.
