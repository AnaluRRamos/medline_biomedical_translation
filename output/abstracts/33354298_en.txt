Dementia causes disorders in multiple higher cortical functions. Visual impairment could further impact cognition in those with dementia. This study reports the results of a computerized attention training program in a patient with dementia and visual impairment. The case involves a 98-year-old woman with bilateral maculopathy and moderate dementia. The program consisted of pre- and post-assessments and training sessions. Assessments included the Cantonese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination, the digit span forward test, the Chinese version of the Verbal Learning Test (CVVLT), and the Test of Attentional Performance (TAP). Training sessions were conducted once to twice a week for a total of 8 45-minute sessions. The participant showed a decrease in the CVVLT score and improvements in TAP parameters. The results indicated that, in visually impaired older adults with dementia, attention and processing speed (measured by a sensitive test such as TAP) could potentially be improved with appropriate computerized training.
