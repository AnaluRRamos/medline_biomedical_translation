Prognathism is a common skeletal facial abnormality, associated with class III malocclusion, often with repercussions in quality of life. In addition to orthodontic treatment, sagittal split ramus osteotomy is the most common technique for its correction, and segment osteosynthesis is an important element of the post-surgical outcome. A search for relevant literature was conducted in the PubMed/MEDLINE database and in other relevant sources. The stability of different fixation methods, their repercussions on inferior alveolar nerve lesions, and the type of material are among the most researched subjects. Recent research about the type of osteosynthesis applied in the sagittal split ramus osteotomy for mandibular setback is discussed. Miniplates appear to be the better option for fixation of sagittal split osteotomy for mandibular setback. Bioabsorbable osteosynthesis may be an acceptable alternative to titanium.
