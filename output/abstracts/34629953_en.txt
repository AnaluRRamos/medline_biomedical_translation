Evaluate the experience of private and public health services with the WALANT procedure in the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a retrospective, multicenter longitudinal study gathering cases of hand surgery subjected to the WALANT technique in the Hospitals Dr. Radam√©s Nardini and IFOR during the COVID-19 pandemic (August 2020). As a parameter, the verbal numerical rating scale for twenty patients referring to the preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative periods was applied. The patients did not feel any pain during surgery, which showed the efficiency of the anesthetic technique in its purpose. The results indicate the WALANT technique as beneficial when facing the COVID-19 pandemic, as the main differential of the technique is that it is applied by a well-trained orthopedic hand surgeon. <b><i>Level of Evidence IV, Case Series.</i></b>
