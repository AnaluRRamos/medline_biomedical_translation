This article seeks to establish the coverage of neonatal hearing screening in Brazil between January 2008 and June 2015. It is an ecological study that uses the country, through the Urban Articulation Regions, as a base. To calculate the screening coverage percentage, the Live Births Information System, the Outpatient Information System and the Beneficiaries of the National Supplementary Health Agency Information System were used. An exploratory analysis of maps and spatial statistical analysis was conducted using TerraView 4.2.2 software. The coverage of neonatal hearing screening saw an increase of 9.3% to 37.2% during the study period. In 2008-2009 it was observed that the percentage of coverage ranged from 0% to 79.92%, but most areas received coverage from 0% to 20%, though in 2014-2015 coverage ranged from 0% to 171.77%, and there was a visible increase in the percentage of coverage in the country, mainly in the Southern Region. The screening coverage has increased over time, but is still low with an uneven distribution in the territory, which may be explained by local laws and policies and by the existence of different types of auditory health service in the country.
