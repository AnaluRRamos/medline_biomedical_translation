Brain-damaged patients can develop abnormal attitudes towards their deficits. Misoplegia is one such example, involving exaggerated aversion to an impaired limb, sometimes associated with hatred of paresis and verbal or physical abuse directed at the paretic limb. Few studies or reports on this disorder are available in the literature, prompting the present case report of a patient with misoplegia and vascular dementia.
