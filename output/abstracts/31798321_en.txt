To evaluate normative data of shoulder isokinetic strength in healthy professional judo athletes. Cross-sectional study with 20 professional male and female athletes (10 female), evaluated with an isokinetic dynamometer. The strength assessment was carried out in external and internal rotation, flexion, extension, adduction and abduction. All data collected on muscle torque were normalized with body mass index. Athletes demonstrated higher peak torque and joint work in shoulder adduction, abduction, flexion, and extension for the dominant limb compared to the non-dominant limb (p <0.05), with most of these deficits below 10%. Shoulder internal/external rotation ratios for male and female athletes had no significant differences between dominant and non-dominant sides, demonstrating values at 60°/s of 49.4 ± 7.2 on the dominant side of males and 49.1 ± 4.9 for females. The normative data are described to assist during treatment, return to sport and injury prevention. <b><i>Level of evidence IV, cross-sectional study.</i></b>
