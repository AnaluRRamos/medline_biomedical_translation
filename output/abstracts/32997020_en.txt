This study aimed to identify an association between the most frequent multimorbidities in Brazilian older adults and socioeconomic and lifestyle variables. National Health Survey's data were used. The Chi-square test and the Poisson multiple regression were used to analyze data. A total of 5,575 older adults with multimorbidity and mean age of 70.3 years participated in the study. Most of them are female (66.3%), white (56.1%), are sedentary (75.3%), with low schooling (40%), no health plan (65.3%), did not consume alcohol (78.7%) and did not smoke (90.1%). The most prevalent multimorbidities were hypertension and high cholesterol (31.3%), hypertension and stroke (30.9%) and hypertension and diabetes (23.3%). There was an association of the first condition with females, younger adults and no tobacco use. On the other hand, the second condition was associated with females and low level of schooling. The third group was associated with low schooling, sedentary lifestyle and no tobacco use. We can conclude that multimorbidity in Brazilian older adults is a frequent condition in women, younger seniors and those socioeconomically disadvantaged. Also, socioeconomic conditions and lifestyle influenced the prevalence of primary multimorbidities.
