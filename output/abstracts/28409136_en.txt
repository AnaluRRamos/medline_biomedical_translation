To evaluate the functional outcomes of patients submitted to arthroscopic repair of triple labral lesion. This was an analytical retrospective study of patients who underwent arthroscopic treatment of triple labral lesion from March 2005 to December 2014. Patients with at least one year of postoperative follow-up were included. A total of nine patients were evaluated. The mean age was 32.3 years and the dominant side was affected in five patients. Patients were functionally assessed regarding the range of motion (ROM) in elevation, external rotation with the arm close to the body the arm in abduction of 90°, and internal rotation, and by the Carter-Rowe score. The degree of satisfaction was assessed at the end of the follow-up period. Three patients had less than five episodes of instability, four patients had between five and ten episodes, and two patients had more than ten episodes. Seven patients had positive O'Brien test for SLAP lesions and positive apprehension test in abduction and external rotation, and only one patient had apprehension in adduction and internal rotation. Three patients persisted with positive O'Brien test and one with apprehension in abduction and external rotation at the end of follow-up. The range of motion was complete in all cases. The median Carter-Rowe score increased from 40 preoperatively to 90 (<i>p</i> = 0.008). The arthroscopic repair of triple labral lesions allows for the restoration of the stability of the glenohumeral joint, achieving excellent functional results.
