Occupational Surveys are methods of collecting data from the cross-sectional studies, which are indispensable for the elaboration of public policies oriented to workers' health. The objective of this study was to perform a systematic review on articles that featured results of Occupational Surveys conducted in Brazil from 2005 to 2015. Based on the Prisma recommendation, this review selected articles indexed in Medline, Lilacs and Scielo databases. Analysis of the data consisted of the description of the Occupational Surveys according to: large regions in which the research was carried out; techniques and instruments used; topics covered; sectors of the economy in which health-work relations were investigated; and methodological criteria. Differences in the distribution of Occupational Surveys were observed regionally and by sector. The structure of the investigations, for the most part, was concerned with identifying sickness in workers. A lack of consensus regarding the methods used was revealed, which consequently prejudiced the comparison of results and monitoring of health and working conditions. Efforts are needed to build consensus and foster research in sectors and regions that are as yet scantly explored.
