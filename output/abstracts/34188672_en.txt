Variations in the upper limb arterial pattern are commonplace and necessitate complete familiarity for successful surgical and interventional procedures. Variance in the vascular tree may involve any part of the axis artery of the upper limb, including the axillary artery and brachial artery or its branches, in the form of radial and ulnar arteries, which eventually supply the hand via anastomosing arches. To study the peculiarities of the arterial pattern of the upper limb and to correlate them with embryological development. The entire arterial branching of forty-two upper limbs of formalin fixed adult human cadavers was examined during routine dissection for educational purposes, conducted over a 3-year period in the Department of Anatomy, Lady Hardinge Medical College, New Delhi. The study found: 1) One case in which a common trunk arose from the third part of the axillary artery, which immediately splayed into four branches (2.4%); 2) High division of the brachial artery into ulnar and radial arteries, in 3 cases (7.1%); 3) Pentafurcation of the brachial artery into ulnar, interosseus, radial, and radial recurrent arteries and a muscular twig to the brachioradialis in 1/42 cases (2.4%); 4) Incomplete Superficial Palmar arch in 3/42 cases (7.1%); and 5) Presence of a median artery in 2/42 case(4.8%). This study observed and described the varied arterial patterns of the upper limb and identified the various anomalous patterns, supplementing the surgeon's armamentarium in various surgical procedures, thereby helping to prevent complications or failures of reconstructive surgeries, bypass angiography, and many similar procedures.
