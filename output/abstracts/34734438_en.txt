Fungal culture is widely used as a diagnostic tool for detecting dermatophytosis. However, the presence of fungal contaminants can influence the culture's performance and compromise the diagnosis. To verify whether the sample processing time can affect the performance of fungal culture for the diagnosis of Microsporum canis infection in cats. Forty Persian cats. Hair and scale samples were collected by combing the coat using a 5 × 5 cm sterile polyester carpet. The carpets were assigned randomly to four groups based on time point of processing samples after collection (i.e. used for culture on a selective agar medium for dermatophytes): Group 1: 8 h (n = 10); Group 2: 24 h (n = 10); Group 3: 48 h (n = 10); and Group 4: 72 h (n = 10). Cultures were compared regarding the degree of fungal invasion by either M. canis or nondermatophytic contaminant moulds (NDM). Processing samples after 24 h of storage resulted in increased isolation rates of NDM and decreased isolation rates of M. canis. Samples processed after 48 h and 72 h presented more than half of the plates with a high degree of fungal contamination (i.e. NDM occupying ≥50% of the total fungal mass). However, samples processed after 8 h and 24 h presented a lower degree (P < 0.05) of NDM plate invasion and higher recovery rates of M. canis when compared to samples processed after 48 h and 72 h. Delayed processing time is closely associated with the overgrowth of contaminants and with lower recovery rates of M. canis.
