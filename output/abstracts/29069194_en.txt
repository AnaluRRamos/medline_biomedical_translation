This study analyzed the Worker's Surveillance activities of Family Health teams, based on the perceptions of physicians and nurses in the city of Jo√£o Pessoa. We used a 30-question questionnaire split into four blocks: data on the professional, occupational healthcare practices focusing on the production and epidemiological profile, and matrix and institutional support to the teams. A total of 179 professionals participated, 82% of them were female, and 46% aged 50 or more; 60% had worked in the area for more than 10 years. Results show that Worker's Surveillance activities are not part of team day-to-day activities: 53% mapped productive activities and 30% related them to health hazards. Twenty-four percent mentioned activities to eliminate/mitigate exposure to risk and vulnerabilities. The support of Family Health teams by the Reference Center for Occupational Health was mentioned by 45% of the participants, less than the number reported for Worker's Surveillance. Involvement in occupational health training was mentioned by 24% of the professionals. Results suggest the need to expand and strengthen continued education and team support.
