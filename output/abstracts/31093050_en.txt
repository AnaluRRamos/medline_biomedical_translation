The demographic aging in Cuba has caused considerable changes in mortality and morbidity; its growing trend and high speed affect the attention of the elderly, posing a challenge to public health. This article focuses on years 1950-2015, and aims to present the situation of this population phenomenon from a positive view, according to three aspects: aging as an achievement, challenge and development opportunity; demographic and epidemiological transitions; and policies and strategies to address aging. The general fertility rate has decreased from 4.01 to 1.45, and the life expectancy at birth and the life expectancy at third age have increased from 59.40 to 78.45 years and from 16.04 to 22.58, respectively. The proportion of people aged 60 and over in Cuba amounts to 19.8%. Causes of morbidity and mortality have changed from infectious diseases to non-communicable diseases. In Cuba, aging is the result of a sustained reduction in fertility and mortality, and a negative migratory balance. The challenge of the dependency of the elderly person and the need for care is discussed. Although this demographic indicator represents an achievement and a development opportunity, population aging poses a challenge for development and public health, for which comprehensive and cross-sectional policies and strategies aimed at mitigating its negative effects have been established.
