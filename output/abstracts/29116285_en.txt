To investigate aspects of health care provided to the elderly, as a way to undertake health surveillance initiatives. Cross-sectional quantitative study with elderly people who participate in health promotion groups in health centers at Florian√≥polis, Santa Catarina, Brazil. Surveys were conducted on aspects relative to comprehensive health care provision, namely, records of the Family Health Strategy, diagnosis, awareness of initiatives to treat non-communicable diseases, as well as awareness of related risks and complications. A descriptive statistical analysis was performed of the profile and perception of elderly patients about comprehensive health care. Were interviewed 58 elderly patients; 94.83% of them reported having Arterial Hypertension (AH); 44.83%, Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and 39.66% reported having both comorbidities. Only a small part of the participants was aware of initiatives promoted by health centers for treatment of AH and DM; thus, there is little participation of the elderly in such initiatives. It was found that these patients still have limited awareness of the risks of not treating chronic Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs). The population's lack of awareness of primary health care initiatives and low adherence must be addressed by primary health care policies. Importantly, awareness-raising proposals that seek to integrate health promotion and disease prevention may bring comprehensive health care provision to the elderly, thus strengthening health surveillance initiatives.
