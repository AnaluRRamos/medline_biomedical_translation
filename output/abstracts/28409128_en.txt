Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) are multi-functional growth factors to promote bone healing with the proposal of less morbidity compared to the usual methods of bone graft harvest. Pseudoarthrosis occur when the fusion attempt fails, a solid fusion is not achieved, or there is motion across the segment leading to it, and it can be clinically symptomatic as pain, deformity, neurocompression, or hardware failure. BMPs are used at spinal fusion as a tool for the treatment of degenerative, traumatic, neoplastic and infectious conditions of the spine. This review shows that the use of BMPS is effective and secure when compared with iliac crest bone graft (ICGB); however, depending of the location of usage (cervical spine, lumbar spine or sacrum) and the medical status of the patient (presence of comorbidities, tobacco usage), it is more likely to exhibit complications. Therefore, the use of these proteins must be an informed decision of patient and physician preferences.
