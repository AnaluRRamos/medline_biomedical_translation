Osteosynthesis with intramedullary nailing is considered the method of choice to treat diaphyseal femur fractures in adults. The objective of this retrospective study was to evaluate the bone healing time and incidence of infection in patients with diaphyseal femur fractures treated surgically with retrograde and antegrade intramedullary nailing. The medical records of 123 patients from two university hospitals dated 2011-2013 were evaluated, with 126 diaphyseal femur fractures having been found. The most frequent treatment was antegrade intramedullary nailing (51%), of which 38% involved reaming (n=25). We found evidence of 92% healed fractures at 12 months postoperatively. Complications included chronic osteomyelitis in one patient and femoral neck fracture in another patient, both after reamed antegrade nailing. Pyoarthritis of the knee associated with osteomyelitis affected two patients after reamed retrograde nailing and one patient after unreamed retrograde nailing. We did not observe a significant difference in bone healing rates with the use of reamed or unreamed antegrade or retrograde nailing. Complications included the presence of infection with an incidence similar to that reported in the literature, and of particular significance, unrelated to the type of approach. <b><i>Level of evidence III, Retrospective comparative study.</i></b>
