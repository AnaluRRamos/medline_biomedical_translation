Brazil was the first country to commit to the United Nations' Decade of Action on Nutrition with ambitious goals related to controlling obesity and reducing the intake of sugar-sweetened beverages. In this study, we describe legislative efforts related to sugar-sweetened beverage taxation introduced in the Brazilian Legislature throughout the first four years of this decade as well as the status of the decision-making process. We searched databases within the Chamber of Deputies and the Federal Senate for legislative proposals introduced between 2016 and 2019 that addressed sugary drinks taxation. The results are presented narratively. The content of the bills and status of the legislative process are described. Ten bills were identified. Six of them are aimed at raising taxes and are currently under consideration in the Committees by the first legislative House. Four bills had been aimed at repealing an act which increased taxes on soft drink concentrates, but they have since been rejected and archived. There still seems to be a long road ahead before taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages are raised in Brazil. The lawmaking process in the Brazilian Legislature is complex and slow. This poses two risks: no law being passed; or enacted legislation not being capable to cause significant impact on public health by 2025.
