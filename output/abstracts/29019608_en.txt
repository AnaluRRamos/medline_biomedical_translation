This essay examines the historiography of international exhibitions, seen as geopolitical phenomena of modernity to which are associated the rise of middle classes, nationalist and colonialist movements, as well as an exhibitionary network connecting distinct spaces and times. Most of the recent studies analyses this repertoire and this pattern, and their relationship with political, economic, social and cultural issues. This study stresses, among ongoing approaches, the Latin American work - still barely visible or integrated into a field which is already consolidated -, and suggests how its visibility can be improved.
