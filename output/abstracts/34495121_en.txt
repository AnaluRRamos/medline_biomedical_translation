This article describes the Boletim da Clínica Psiquiátrica da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo, which was published from 1962 to 1971. This was the first scientific publication of the Psychiatric Clinic, and was replaced by the Revista de Psiquiatria Clínica, which still exists today. The Boletim is a valuable source for historical research, spanning a decade of Brazilian psychiatry, and contains a variety of content: medication trials, theoretical discussions, current events, and institutional issues related to the development of psychiatry and related areas such as psychology and psychoanalysis, as well as the arrival of medications and the search for standardized diagnoses.
