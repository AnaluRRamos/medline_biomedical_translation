The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is mostly responsible for providing knee stability. ACL injury has a marked effect on daily activities, causing pain, dysfunction, and elevated healthcare costs. ACL reconstruction (ACLR) is the standard treatment for this injury. However, despite good results, ACLR is associated with a significant rate of failure. In this context, the mechanical and biological causes must be considered. From a biological perspective, the ACLR depends on the osseointegration of the graft in the adjacent bone and the process of intra-articular ligamentization for good results. Here, we discuss the mechanisms underlying the normal graft healing process after ACLR and its biological modulation, thus, presenting novel strategies for biological enhancements of the ACL graft. <b><i>Level of evidence III, Systematic review of level III studies.</i></b>
