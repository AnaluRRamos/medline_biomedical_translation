This paper aims to analyze the mortality trend in the population aged 5-69 years residing in the Southeast and Federal Units (UF), using the 'Brazilian List of Preventable Deaths Causes'. An ecological study on time series of the standardized mortality rate from preventable and non-preventable causes, with adjustments for ill-defined causes and underreporting of notified deaths, from 2000 to 2013. A declining mortality rate from preventable (2.4% per year) and non-preventable causes (1.5% per year) was found in the population aged 5-69 years living in the Southeast in the period 2000-2013. A drop in all groups of preventable deaths causes and stability in the maternal death causes was observed. Deaths from noncommunicable diseases fell 2.7% annually and were higher in the age group of 60-69 years in 2013 (211.8/100,000 inhabitants for deaths from ischemic heart disease, 146.3/100,000 inhabitants for cerebrovascular diseases and 96.5/100,000 inhabitants for diabetes). The highest preventable death rates are from chronic noncommunicable diseases and external causes, both of which are sensitive to health promotion and intersectoral interventions, which reinforces the need for integrated health policies.
