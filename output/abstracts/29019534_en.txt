to evaluate the quality of life of patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopy for primary hyperhidrosis. we evaluated the patients who underwent thoracoscopic sympathectomy to treat primary hyperhidrosis by the team of thoracic surgery at the University Hospital Gaffr√©e and Guinle - UNIRIO between July 2004 and August 2013. It was applied a questionnaire about quality of life related to hyperhidrosis since preoperative period until one year after the surgery. one hundred twenty two patients answered the questionnaire, with a mean age of 25 years, 57% of whom were women. In relation to severity of primary hyperhidrosis, 83% of the patients reported as tolerable or somewhat tolerable associated with major limitation of quality of life, which it was poor or very poor in 82% of cases. Postoperative compensatory hyperhidrosis occurred in 78% of patients, but it was regarded as invisible or barely noticeable for 85% of these patients, classifying it as acceptable. In 15% of patients, the compensatory sweating was classified as disruptive. thoracoscopic sympathectomy improves the quality of life of patients with primary hyperhidrosis. The transitional compensatory hyperhidrosis occurred in most patients, but did not improve significantly the quality of life.
