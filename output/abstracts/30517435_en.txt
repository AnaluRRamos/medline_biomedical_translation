To identify the adverse reactions associated with the infusion of hematopoietic stem cells on day zero of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Integrative literature review, without temporal cut, with search in the following databases: PubMed, CINAHL, SCOPUS, BVS, SciELO, Web of Science and CAPES; the final sample consisted of 18 scientific articles, published between 1998 and 2017, based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Mild and moderate adverse reactions were the most frequent in studies that used the classification by severity, and nausea and emesis had the highest incidence; the most affected organ systems were the cardiovascular, respiratory and gastrointestinal. The main adverse reactions identified in the studies were nausea and emesis.
