The study aimed to analyze the magnitude and sociodemographic profile of leprosy cases linked to household contact networks with overlapping of the disease in two Brazilian municipalities (counties), one in the North and the other in the Northeast, from 2001 to 2014. This was a cross-sectional, descriptive, analytical study based on primary and secondary data from new leprosy cases in Picos, Piauí State, and Rolim de Moura, Rondônia State. 'Overlapping' was defined as new cases with the occurrence of at least one more leprosy case in the individual's household contact network. Each household contact network consisted of the index case (first reported case), co-prevalent cases (contacts that became new cases), and household contacts of the index case. A total of 437 new cases treated by the INTEGRAHANS North-Northeast and Piauí projects were assessed, of which 287 (65.7%) were in Picos and 150 (34.3%) in Rolim de Moura. Of all the cases assessed, 129 (44.9%) in Picos and 98 (65.3%) in Rolim de Moura reported overlapping. There were proportionally more females in Rolim de Moura (n = 95, 63.3%) and males in Picos (n = 147, 51.2%); in the 41-60-year age bracket (Rolim de Moura n = 70, 46.7%; Picos n = 115, 40.1%); with elementary schooling (Rolim de Moura n = 80, 54%; Picos n = 125, 44.5%); and individuals living in the same household with up to 3 persons in Rolim de Moura (n = 105, 70%) and with more than 4 persons in Picos (n = 287, 100%). Overlapping of leprosy cases in household contact networks was considerably high in the contexts analyzed here, displaying aspects of expanded vulnerability. This perspective should be considered and integrated into leprosy surveillance and control activities.
