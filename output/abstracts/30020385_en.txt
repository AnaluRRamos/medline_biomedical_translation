The present study attempts to systemize the experiences of those that have been treated in the primary health care system for alcohol and drug abuse with a view to obtaining reductions in the damages caused to Brazil and the world at large. A bibliographical study was conducted of publications in Portuguese and in English over the past ten years on the following databases SciELO, Lilacs, Medline and PsycINFO. After the selection of the corpus, meta-synthesis was carried out in order to integrate the material obtained. It was possible to identify and analyze advances and impasses in the implementation of harm reduction strategies, and to compare the different approaches identified in the services and care activities offered to users. We noticed that Harm Reduction has become consolidated as a prevention and health care strategy; therefore, it is essential that more academic and scientific research in this area is conducted.
