An estimated 61% of the 24.3 million people diagnosed with dementia worldwide live in underdeveloped countries, including Brazil, where a public healthcare system covers the majority of the population. This care is usually provided by General Practitioners (GP) and in Brazil many doctors recently graduated from medical school and residents of different medical specialties practice as GPs. The aim of this study was to describe the knowledge and attitudes about dementia in a sample of Brazilian medical residents from a university-hospital in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. A total of 152 Brazilian medical residents participated in the study. Participants answered a 'Knowledge Quiz' (KQ) and 'Attitude Quiz' (AQ) about dementia issues, transculturally adapted for use in Brazilian physicians. A descriptive analysis of the correct answers on knowledge and of the attitude aspects was performed. The medical residents showed poor knowledge (<50%) about dementia prevalence and incidence and a good knowledge on disease management and diagnosis. Participants tended to be optimistic about caring for demented patients. In this study, it is likely that the physicians' good knowledge about dementia issues is the reason for their optimism dealing with demented patients.
