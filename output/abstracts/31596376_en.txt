To analyze the prevalence of altered total cholesterol and fractions levels in the Brazilian population, according to biochemical data from the National Health Survey. A descriptive study, using data from the National Health Survey, collected between 2014 and 2015. Total cholesterol and fractions were analyzed and population prevalences of altered values according to socio-demographic variables were calculated. The cutoff points considered were: total cholesterol ≥ 200mg/dl; low-density lipoprotein LDL ≥ 130mg/dL and high-density lipoprotein HDL < 40mg/dL. The prevalence of total cholesterol ≥200mg/dL in the population was 32.7%, and higher in women (35.1%). The prevalence of altered HDL was 31.8%, 22.0% in females and 42.8% in males. LDL ≥ 130mg/dL was found in 18.6% and was higher in women (19.9%). The population aged 45 years old and older and those with low levels of education presented a higher prevalence of altered cholesterol. Altered values of total cholesterol and fractions were frequent in the Brazilian population, especially among women, the elderly and people with low levels of education. These results may guide control and preventative actions such as healthy eating, physical activity and treatment, all of which aim to prevent coronary diseases.
