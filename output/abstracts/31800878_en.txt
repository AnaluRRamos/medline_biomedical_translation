To investigate the immediate effect of phonation into silicone tube on self-assessment and vocal quality of gospel singers. The sample was composed of 40 gospel singers without vocal complaint, males and females, from 18 to 40 years. The singers performed semi-occluded vocal tract exercise in LaxVoxÂ® silicone tube. The end of the tube was submerged in water (2cm depth), for three minutes. Before and after exercise, voice recording was performed for perceptive-auditory evaluation, and only after exercise, the voice and comfort phonation self-assessments (CSA) were performed. The descriptive and inferential statistical analysis were performed. All participants reported improvement in voice. In addition, a significant higher proportion of them indicated phonation comfort improvement after exercise. According to the perceptive-auditory evaluation, there was no difference in the comparison of the proportions of pre- and post-exercise perceptive-auditory evaluation categories in gospel singers. The phonation exercise into a silicone tube caused an immediate positive effect on gospel singers' voice and comfort phonation self-assessments. There was no significant difference in the perceptive-auditory evaluation before and after phonation into silicone tube in gospel singers.
