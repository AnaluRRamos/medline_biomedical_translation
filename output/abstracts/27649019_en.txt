Foreign body aspiration is common in children and in the elderly, who may present with subtle symptoms. Clinical suspicion is crucial and bronchoscopy is the main diagnostic and therapeutic procedure available. This is the case of a man, 78 years old, with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, who presented with respiratory distress following oral intake of tablets. History taking and physical examination raised suspicion. The diagnosis was confirmed with flexible bronchoscopy and rigid bronchoscopy was carried out for treatment. The patient's condition is stable and he is under investigations for dysphagia.
