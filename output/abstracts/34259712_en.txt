The sharp growth in COVID-19 cases and deaths has created a heavy overburden on Brazil's health system, especially in the cities of Manaus (Amazonas State), Rio de Janeiro, and São Paulo. The description of the pandemic's impact has been based on absolute numbers and crude mortality rates, failing to consider the age distribution patterns in different regions of the country. This study aims to compare the crude mortality rates from COVID-19 with age-standardized rates in the state capitals and Federal District. Information on deaths was accessed in the Information System on Influenza Surveillance (SIVEP-Gripe), and the population denominators were based on the estimate provided by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. Calculation of the age-standardized rates used the estimated age structure of the Brazilian population in 2020. The results show that the highest crude rates were in Manaus (253.6/100,000) and Rio de Janeiro (253.2/100,000). Age standardization led to a major increase in the North of Brazil. The highest age-adjusted rate was in Manaus (412.5/100,000), where 33% of COVID-19 deaths occurred in individuals under 60 years of age. Mortality in Manaus over 70 years of age was double that of Rio de Janeiro and triple that of São Paulo. The use of age-adjusted mortality rates eliminates interpretative biases, clearly exposing the even greater weight of COVID-19 in the North of Brazil.
