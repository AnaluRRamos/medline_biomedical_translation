This article addresses the main interpretations employed to understand science communication as a discursive reformulation of scientific discourse and as a genre of discourse of its own. Both these interpretations are analyzed critically, since the characteristics of the discourse of science communication are not equivalent to translation parameters nor compatible with criteria to understanding them as a component of their own discursive genre. Finally, it is emphasized that science communication should be understood as praxis objectified through activities developed amidst diverse spheres of ideological creation.
