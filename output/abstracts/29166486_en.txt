Numerous studies have highlighted the tendency to chronicity of treatments centered on the use of medications. This study was conducted in a large Brazilian city with users of Centers for Psychosocial Care (CAPS), with the aim of evaluating the effects of experimenting with the personal Guide for Autonomous Management of Medication (GAM) and the users' relationship to their treatments and participation. The instrument, created in Canada and translated and adapted to Brazil, was tested in intervention groups with users of CAPS with severe mental disorders and a history of political participation in the field of health. Focus groups and in-depth interviews were performed. The transcriptions were transformed into narratives, and four analytical categories were defined: subjects with radical experiences of suffering; experiences with medication; users' rights; and participation and political activism. In testing GAM, users expressed a tension between reproduction of illness-centered identity and the legitimate uniqueness of their personal experiences. They showed greater knowledge of the medications they were taking, began to recognize their own expertise in their use of medications, and some sought adjustments to their treatment. They reported the need for support in claiming their rights and strengthening their participation as mental health activists. In conclusion, the Brazilian version of the GAM guide has the potential to contribute to users' empowerment, thus allowing dialogue between the results in mental health care in Brazil and the international scenario.
