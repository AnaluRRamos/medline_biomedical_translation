The aim of the current study was to compare the effect of two lithium disilicate ceramic processing techniques (pressing and CAD/CAM) on the degree of conversion of resin cement when it is photoactivated and the microshear bond strength of resin cement to ceramics. Two ceramic discs were manufactured: one by the Press technique and another by CAD/CAM technique. Five Variolink Veneer resin cement samples were photoactivated through each ceramic disc and subjected to attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to evaluate their degree of conversion. To evaluate microshear bond strength, 20 ceramic bars were prepared: 10 using the Press technique and 10 using the CAD/CAM technique. The bars were air abraded with 50-μm Al2O3 particles, treated with 10% hydrofluoric acid for 20 s and subjected to RelyX Ceramic Primer application. Adper Scotchbond Multi-Purpose Adhesive was applied to the bars and cured for 10 s. Two 1-mm-height plastic tubes were placed on each bar and filled with Variolink Veneer resin cement. Each cylinder was cured for 20 s. Then the plastic tubes were removed and the microshear bond strength of each cylinder was tested. Data for degree of conversion (%) and microshear bond strength (MPa) were subjected to Student's t-test (α = 0.05). Both degree of conversion of resin cement photoactivated through ceramic and microshear bond strength of resin cement to ceramic were statistically higher in the group in which ceramic was prepared by CAD/CAM technique (44.74% and 22.18 MPa) than in the group in which the ceramic was prepared by the Press technique (25.71% and 19.83 MPa). The lithium disilicate ceramic processing techniques affected the degree of conversion of resin cement when it is photoactivated through the ceramics and the microshear bond strength of resin cement to ceramics.
