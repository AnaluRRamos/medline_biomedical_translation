To identify and compare the structure and content of representations of domestic violence against women among students in the initial and final grades of a nursing undergraduate course. A qualitative study was carried out between August/November 2014, in Rio Grande/RS, with 132 nursing students, 71 of the initial grades and 61 of the final grades. The data has been collected through evocations and interviews; for the treatment, the EVOC software and content analysis have been used. Approval under Opinion 109/2014. In common in the central nucleus are the terms violence, cowardice, disrespect and pain. The first group evoked sadness and the second, physical violence. The representation has negative connotations, with discrete differentiation. The students of the final series are based on the reified knowledge and have the structured representation, with concept, image and attitude. It is hoped that the students will contribute to the prevention, identification and intervention of victims of violence.
