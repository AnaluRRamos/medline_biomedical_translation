Neglected tropical diseases constitute a heterogeneous group of diseases that have as a common characteristic to affect poor and unassisted populations with little vocalization capacity and political power. As a result, they receive little attention from the pharmaceutical industry and academia. The present study aimed to summarize the state of the art regarding vaccine development for three relevant neglected tropical diseases in Brazil: Chagas disease, schistosomiasis (Schistosoma mansoni), and leishmaniasis. To this end, we conducted a narrative review of the scientific literature, including publications that allowed us to outline a current overview on the vaccine development for the three diseases. Vaccines against the three diseases are in different stages of development. Vaccine development projects against American trypanosomiasis have yet to reach the clinical evaluation phase. For schistosomiasis, we have candidates for the vaccine in the advanced phase of clinical evaluation. For leishmaniasis, there are already licensed veterinary vaccines, and product candidates for human vaccine in the intermediate stage of clinical evaluation. The reduced funding for these projects has contributed to slow product development.
