To evaluate the prevalence of pain and radiographic degenerative arthritis in a group of severe obese patients (body mass index [BMI] > 35). 41 patients with an indication of bariatric surgery were studied. The group of severely obese patients was subdivided into two subgroups: those with BMI < 50 and those with BMI > 50 (<i>n</i> = 14). They were compared to control group (<i>n</i> = 39). The following parameters were analyzed and correlated: radiographic arthritis by Kellgren-Lawrence's classification, tibiofemoral axis, gender, age, and knee pain (visual analog scale [VAS]). The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) was used to evaluate in 21 severe obese patients and IN 19 controls. A higher incidence of knee pain was observed in the severely obese group when compared with the control group (<i>p</i> < 0.0001, odds ratio: 2.96). In the severely obese group, increasing levels of pain with aging were observed (<i>p</i> = 0.047). A positive correlation was observed between the incidence of radiographic arthritis and increasing age in the severely obese (<i>p</i> = 0.001) and control (<i>p</i> = 0.037) groups. The WOMAC index results were worse in the severely obese group when compared with the control group (<i>p</i> = 0.001, odds ratio: 18.2). A higher incidence of knee pain was observed in the severely obese group when compared with the control group. In the severely obese group, there increasing levels of pain with aging. A positive relation between the incidence of arthritis and increasing age was observed in the severely obese and control groups. The WOMAC index results were worse in the severely obese group.
