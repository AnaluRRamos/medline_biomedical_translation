This study aimed to identify the prevalence of multimorbidity in Brazilian older adults and factors associated with socioeconomic and lifestyle variables. This is a cross-sectional, population-based study carried out with data from the National Health Survey database. Seniors with multimorbidity where the ones with a diagnosis of two or more chronic diseases. The chi-square test was used in data analysis, and then prevalence ratios were estimated through Poisson multiple regression, both with 95% confidence level. In total, 11,697 older adults were evaluated and the multimorbidity prevalence was 53.1%. As a result of the multivariate analysis, female seniors (p < 0.001), the oldest elderly (p = 0.002), those who were not single, more strongly associated with widowers (p = 0.001) and those with a health plan at the interview (p < 0.001) were associated with multimorbidity. Also, in comparison with older adults with two chronic diseases, women are associated with three (p = 0.003) and four or more chronic diseases (p < 0.001). We can conclude that multimorbidity in Brazilian older adults is a widespread condition and that it has been influenced by socioeconomic factors and is poorly related to lifestyle.
