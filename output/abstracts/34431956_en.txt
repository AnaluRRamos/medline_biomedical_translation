To describe the adequacy of immunobiological agent conservation in vaccination rooms in the municipalities of the Western health macro-region of the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. This was a descriptive study, based on a validated scale, with a maximum score of 15 points. A descriptive analysis and an association test between the scores obtained by the municipalities and variables of the external context were performed. 275 out of a total of 295 existing vaccination rooms were evaluated. Immunobiological agent conservation in the West macro-region obtained an average score of 4 points (standard score, 0 to 15). There was a poor availability of immunization supplies aimed at immunobiological agent conservation, and work processes, that require improvement. Small municipalities presented better immunobiological agent conservation (p=0.011). Immunobiological agent conservation in vaccination rooms in the Western health macro-region of Minas Gerais State was considered inadequate.
