Biliary tract complications following liver transplant remain an important source of morbidity and mortality. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) has become a common therapeutic option before other invasive procedures. The aim of this study was to evaluate ERCP efficacy in managing this type of complications. Retrospective study of all patients who underwent therapeutic ERCP due to post-liver transplant biliary complications between September 2005 and September 2015, at a deceased donor liver transplantation centre. Therapeutic ERCP was performed in 120 patients (64% men; mean age 46 ± 14 years). Biliary complications were anastomotic strictures (AS) in 70%, non-anastomotic strictures (NAS) in 14%, bile leaks (BL) in 5.8%, and bile duct stones (BDS) in 32%. The mean time between liver transplant and first ERCP was: 19 ± 30 months in AS, 17 ± 30 months in NAS, 61 ± 28 months in BDS, and 0.7 ± 0.6 months in BL (<i>p</i> < 0.001). The number of ERCP performed per patient was: 3.8 ± 2.4 in AS, 3.8 ± 2.1 in NAS, 1.9 ± 1 in BDS, and 1.9 ± 0.5 in BL (<i>p</i> = 0.003). The duration of the treatment was: 18 ± 19 months in AS, 21 ± 17 months in NAS, 10 ± 10 months in BDS, and 4 ± 3 months in BL (<i>p</i> = 0.064). Overall, biliary complications were successfully managed by ERCP in 46% of cases, either as an isolated procedure (43%) or rendez-vous ERCP (3%). Per complication, ERCP was effective in 39% of AS, in 12% of NAS, in 91% of BDS, and in 86% of BL. Globally, the mean follow-up of the successful cases was 43 ± 31 months. Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography and/or surgery were performed in 48% of patients in whom ERCP was unsuccessful. The odds ratio for effective endoscopic treatment was 0.2 for NAS (0.057-0.815), 12.4 for BDS (1.535-100.9), and 6.9 for BL (0.798-58.95). No statistical significance was found for AS (<i>p</i> = 0.247). ERCP allowed the treatment of biliary complication in about half of patients, avoiding a more invasive procedure. Endoscopic treatment was more effective for BDS and BL.
