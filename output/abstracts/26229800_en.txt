Fixation of an osteochondral fracture after acute patellar dislocation is an infrequent form of treatment. Likewise, the location of this fragment in the lateral region of the lateral femoral condyle, functioning as a free body, is uncommon. The aim of this study was to present a case of osteochondral fracture of the patella at an unusual site, along with the therapy used and the clinical follow-up.
