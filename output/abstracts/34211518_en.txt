Endovascular aneurysm repair is currently the most frequently treatment modality for infrarenal aortic aneurysms. Endoleaks are the most common cause of reintervention after endovascular aneurysm repair. It is often unclear which type of endoleak is the correct diagnose, making the treatment decision difficult. We report the case of a 72-year-old man with an endoleak two years after endovascular aneurysm repair. Images suggested a type III endoleak, but this was not confirmed by contrast aortography. We proceeded with the investigation using aortography with carbon dioxide and observed a type IA endoleak. This was successfully treated by implantation of a proximal cuff. A review of the literature shows that the role of carbon dioxide in endoleak management is still unclear. We present a case in which carbon dioxide was essential to both diagnosis and therapeutic decision-making in a type IA endoleak.
