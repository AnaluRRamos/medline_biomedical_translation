The atypical form of Pantothenate Kinase-Associated Neurodegeneration (PKAN) tends to present at around the age of 14 years, has a heterogeneous presentation with extrapyramidal symptoms, and approximately one third of patients exhibit psychiatric problems. This paper reports the case of a patient with apparent typical symptoms of Tourette syndrome. However, the severity and poor response to treatment led to further investigation and the diagnosis of PKAN as a secondary cause of Tourettism was reached.
