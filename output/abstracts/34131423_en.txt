To describe the immunogenicity and safety of a tetravalent dengue vaccine (TAK-003) in healthy adolescents living in Mexico City, an area considered non-endemic for dengue (NCT03341637). Participants aged 12-17 years were randomized 3:1 to receive two doses (Month 0 and Month 3) of TAK-003 or placebo. Immunogenicity was assessed by microneutralization assay of dengue neutralizing antibodies at baseline, Months 4 and 9. Solicited and unsolicited adverse events (AEs) were recorded after each vaccination. Serious (SAEs) and medically-attended AEs (MAAEs) were recorded throughout the study. 400 adolescents were enrolled, 391 (97.8%) completed the study. Thirty-six (9%) were baseline seropositive to ≥1 serotypes (reciprocal titer ≥10). Geometric mean titers (GMTs) in baseline seronegative TAK-003 recipients were 328, 1743, 120, and 143 at Month 4, and 135, 741, 46, and 38 at Month 9 against DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4, respectively. Placebo GMTs remained <10. Tetravalent seropositivity rates in vaccine recipients were 99.6% and 85.8% at Months 4 and 9, respectively. One MAAE in each group was considered treatment-related (TAK-003: injection-site erythema, and placebo: pharyngitis). TAK-003 was immunogenic against all four serotypes and was well tolerated in dengue-naïve adolescents living in Mexico City.
