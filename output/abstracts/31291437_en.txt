to analyze the incompleteness of variables retrieved from the Live Birth Information System (SINASC) and the Mortality Information System (SIM), in the State of Rio de Janeiro, in the time series 1999 to 2014. this was a time series study of SINASC and SIM; the Romero & Cunha score was used to analyze incompleteness; Joinpoint regression was used to analyze temporal trend; in 2014, deaths were evaluated separately according to investigation. regarding SINASC variables, in 1999 marital status (37.40%), number of stillborn children (31.30%), and race/skin color (24.63%) had the highest incompleteness percentages; in 2014, no variable exceeded 5% incompleteness, except occupation; regarding SIM variables, in 1999 five variables exceeded 20%, and missing data for previous stillborn children was over 60%; in 2014, only one variable exceeded 20% incompleteness; investigated deaths had better completeness. both systems were found to have improved; the quality of SINASC completeness remained superior to that of SIM.
