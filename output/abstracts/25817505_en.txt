Paragangliomas are rare tumors, with a reported incidence of 2-8 per million. They are chromaffin cell tumors that develop from the neural crest cells and may be divided in tumors derived from the parasympathetic or sympathetic ganglia. We report a case a of a 32-year-old nulliparous woman, referred to our Infertility Clinic. Abdomino-pelvic ultrasound identified a large abdominopelvic tumor, without ovarian origin (both ovaries were identified and had normal morphology). Magnetic Resonance Imaging suggested a right adnexal multicystic, vascularized mass close to iliac vessels and questioning an ovarian origin. At exploratory laparotomy, a 10 cm encapsulated and vascularized mass was found beginning just below right renal artery and extending to the level of the broad ligament. This mass was totally excised and histopathology was consistent with Paraganglioma.
