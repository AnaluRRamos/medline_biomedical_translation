The study aimed to estimate the prevalence of sexually transmissible infections (STIs) and associated factors in women in quilombola (maroon) communities in Brazil. This was a population-based cross-sectional study of quilombola women from March 2017 to January 2019. A questionnaire was used with sociodemographic, behavioral, and clinical information. A gynecological examination was performed for the collection of uterine cervical cells for oncotic cytology and the detection of Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Trichomonas vaginalis, and human papillomavirus (HPV) via polymerase chain reaction. Rapid tests for HIV and syphilis were performed. The main outcome was defined as infection with one or more sexually transmissible pathogens. The analysis used chi-square test and hierarchical logistic regression. From a total of 380 women, 352 (92.6%) were included in the study. Prevalence of at least one STI was 18.5% (95%CI: 14.76-22.85). The highest prevalence was for HPV, with 11.1%, followed by 6.3% for T. vaginalis and 4.3% for C. trachomatis. There were no cases of N. gonorrhoeae. Prevalence was 0.3% for HIV and 4.3% for syphilis. Cervical-vaginal cytology was altered in 7.7% of the women. Detection of one or more STIs was significantly associated with age 25 to 44 years (OR = 2.33; 95%CI: 1.05-5.18), alcohol consumption (OR = 1.96; 95%CI: 1.06-3.64), altered cervical cytology (OR = 3.96; 95%CI: 1.65-9.48), and bacterial vaginosis (OR = 3.61; 95%CI: 2.01-6.47). Quilombola women showed high prevalence of one or more STIs, emphasizing the importance of organizing prevention strategies targeted to these women.
