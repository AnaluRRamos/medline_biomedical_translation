The article aimed to verify the association of adolescent social capital with living conditions factors and participation in collective activities. In the cross-sectional study, a validated questionnaire (SCQ-AS) was used to measure the social capital of seventh grade students from public and private schools in a Brazilian city. The parents answered a questionnaire on living conditions and children's participation in collective activities. After chi-square test, multiple logistic regression was performed with social capital' domains, dependent variables and independent variables (pâ‰¤0.20). There was higher frequency of social cohesion at school in adolescents from private schools (OR=4.08, 95% CI 1.39-11.96) and who have a family income of 1 to 3 minimum wages, a larger network of friends among those with parents living together OR = 2.21, 95% CI 1.28 - 3.78) and higher school/neighborhood confidence in private school students (OR=2.71, 95% CI 1.16 - 6.32). There was no association with neighborhood social cohesion. Studying in private school and having a family income of 1 to 3 minimum wages can boost social cohesion in school, as well as practice sports. Parents living together can favor larger network of friends.
