to analyze the factors associated with gait speed in elderly subjects undergoing physical and mental fitness tests to obtain a driver's license. a cross-sectional quantitative study conducted in transit agencies. The probabilistic sample included 421 elderly (â‰¥ 60 years old). The study was developed through application of questionnaires and tests that assess the frailty phenotype. For evaluating gait speed, the time spent by each participant to walk a 4.6 meter distance at normal pace on a flat surface was timed. Data were analyzed by using multiple linear regression and the stepwise method. The R statistical program version 3.4.0 was adopted. there was a significant association between gait speed and paid work (<0.0000), body mass index (<0.0000), Mini-Mental State Examination (=0.0366), physical frailty (pre-frail =0.0063 and non-frail <0.0000), age (<0.0000), sex (=0.0255), and manual grip strength (<0.0000). elderly drivers who do not work, women of advanced age, high body mass index, low score in the Mini-Mental State Examination, low hand grip strength, and frail tend to decrease gait speed and should be a priority of interventions.
