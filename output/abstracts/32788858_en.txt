To establish the association between initial and residual angulation of the distal interphalangeal joint (DIJ) in mallet finger treated conservatively. An observational, prospective, descriptive and analytical research developed with uncomplicated closed mallet finger patients between January and December 2017. A total of two measurements of the DIJ were done, at the initial trauma and 6 weeks after conservative treatment. All measurements were ranked according to the Crawford Classification and Relative Risk was measured. In total, 43 patients were studied, in which 53.48% of outcomes obtained were excellent. The sample was divided in two groups; one with less than 30ยบ of DIJ initial angulation, which had 28% of residual angulation. The second group with more than 30ยบ presented 72.22% of residual angulation. The Relative Risk to present a residual angulation in patients that had 30ยบ of DIJ initial angulation was 2.99 (CI 95%) with p = 0.0059. It is suggested that patients with an initial DIJ angulation more than 30ยบ are more likely to present residual angulation with conservative treatment. Level of Evidence IV, Case series.
