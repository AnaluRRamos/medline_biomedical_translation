Trichophyton benhamiae was diagnosed in a 9-year-old female dog by histopathological evaluation, fungal culture and confirmation by sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region of ribosomal DNA. Successful therapy was achieved with itraconazole, bathing with miconazole and chlorhexidine shampoo, and topical application of sodium hypochlorite as a rinse.
