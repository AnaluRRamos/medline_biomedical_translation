To determine the prevalence and factors associated with anemia in children younger than five years old enrolled in public daycare centers in a city in southwestern Bahia, in the northeast of Brazil. This was a cross-sectional study that included a sample of 677 children enrolled in public daycare centers in Vit√≥ria da Conquista, Bahia, Brazil. A portable hemoglobinometer was used to measure hemoglobin. The concentration of <11 g/dL was considered the cutoff point for a diagnosis of anemia. A questionnaire was applied to parents/guardians in order to collect socioeconomic data, maternal characteristics and information on the child's health and nutrition. Height and weight were measured to assess the child's nutritional status. Poisson regression with robust variance and hierarchical selection of variables was used to identify factors associated with anemia. The prevalence of anemia was 10.2% and was more frequent in children whose homes had no sanitary facilities (PR 3.36; 95%CI 1.40-8.03); in those who did not exclusively breastfeed (PR 1.80; 95%CI 1.12-2.91); in children aged less than 36 months (PR 1.85; 95%CI 1.19-2.89) and those who had low height for age (PR 2.06; 95%CI 1.10-3.85). The prevalence of anemia is considered to be a mild public health problem in the children, who are enrolled in daycare centers. Children with inadequate sanitary conditions, and that were not exclusively breastfed, as well as younger children and children with a nutritional deficit, were more likely to present the condition.
