To demonstrate the clinical and functional results from treatment of humeral diaphysis fractures using Ender nails. Eighteen patients who underwent osteosynthesis of humeral diaphysis fractures using Ender nails were evaluated. In addition to the clinical and radiographic evaluations, patients with a minimum of one year of follow-up were assessed by means of the Constant, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES), Mayo Clinic and Simple Shoulder Value (SSV) functional scores, and in relation to the degree of satisfaction with the final result. The fixation technique used was by means of an anterograde percutaneous route. All the patients achieved fracture consolidation, after a mean of 2.9 months (ranging from 2 to 4 months). The mean Constant score was 85.7 (ranging from 54 to 100) and the mean ASES score was 95.9 (ranging from 76 to 100). All the patients achieved the maximum score on the Mayo Clinic scale. Fixation of humeral diaphysis fractures using Ender nails by means of a percutaneous technique was shown to be a method with promising preliminary results.
