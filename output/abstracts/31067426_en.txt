The incidence of tuberculosis has been increasing worldwide. Contrarily, a recent decrease in Portugal has been reported. Cutaneous tuberculosis comprises a low percentage of all cases. We report a 70-year-old female with a 2-month-history of painful, nodular, suppurative lesions in the groin area, bilaterally. Previous history was remarkable for Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection and stage-IIIB cervical cancer. A skin biopsy, stained with periodic acid-Schiff and Fite's stain, polymerase chain reaction on purulent discharge and mycobacterial culture of the skin were performed, leading to the diagnosis of scrofuloderma. Tuberculostatic therapy was initiated and complete response was observed. This case depicts an uncommon variant of tuberculosis, highlighting the need for awareness of the cutaneous variants of tuberculosis that, although rare, can still present in the clinic today.
