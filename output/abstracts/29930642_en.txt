Variations of the testicular veins are relevant in clinical cases of varicocele and in other therapeutic and diagnostic procedures. We report herein on a unique variation of the left testicular vein observed in an adult male cadaver. The left testicular vein bifurcated to give rise to left and right branches which terminated by joining the left renal vein. There was also an oblique communication between the two branches of the left testicular vein. A slender communicating vein arose from the left branch of the left testicular vein and ascended upwards in front of the left renal vein and terminated into the left suprarenal vein. The right branch of the testicular vein received an unnamed adipose tributary from the side of the abdominal aorta. Awareness of these venous anomalies can help surgeons accurately ligate abnormal venous communications and avoid iatrogenic injuries and it is important for proper surgical management.
