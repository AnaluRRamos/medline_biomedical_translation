Brain calcifications may be present in a wide range of neuropsychiatric, infectious traumatic, neoplastic and endocrine conditions, associated with motor and cognitive symptoms. They are often considered 'physiologic' or pathologic. To determine the prevalence of brain calcifications in a Brazilian cohort. 1898 consecutive patients underwent skull CTs, comprising 836 men and 1062 women. Among all 1898 patients, 333 (197 women and 136 men) presented with brain calcifications, representing an overall prevalence of 17.54%. The prevalence in the female group was 18.54% versus 16.26% in the male group. A growth in incidental findings on CT scans are likely as these exams become more widely available. However, a current debate between radiologists and regulators is set to redefine the CT usage, especially in the United States and the United Kingdom, considering new norms for use and radiation dosage per exam.
