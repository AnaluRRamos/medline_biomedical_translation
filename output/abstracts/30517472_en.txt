To determine the population prevalence of arterial hypertension in adults according to different diagnostic criteria. This is a cross-sectional study, analyzing information from the Brazilian National Health Survey in 2013, consisted of interviews, physical and laboratory measurements (n = 60,202). The prevalence of hypertension was defined according to three diagnostic criteria: self-reported; measured by instrument (blood pressure â‰¥ 140/90 mmHg); measured and/or using medication. Prevalence and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were estimated by the three diagnostic criteria of hypertension. The high blood pressure measurements were: 21.4% (95%CI 20.8 - 22.0) using the criterion self-reported; 22.8% (95%CI 22.1 - 23.4) by measured hypertension; and 32.3% (95%CI 31.7 - 33.0) by measured hypertension and/or reported use of medication. Women presented higher prevalence for the self-reported criterion (24.2%; 95%CI 23.4 - 24.9) and men, for the measured criterion (25.8%; 95%CI 24.8 - 26.8). Hypertension increases with age and is more frequent in urban areas. Using these three criteria, the hypertension was higher in the Southeast and South regions, in relation to the average of the country and the other regions. Using these three criteria, hypertension increased with age, was more frequent in urban areas and in the Southeast and South regions, in relation to the average of the country and the other regions. These findings are important to support policies that aim to achieve the World Health Organization's goal of reducing hypertension by 25% over the next decade.
