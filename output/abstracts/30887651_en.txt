Topical therapy alone can be effective in the treatment of canine pyoderma. Topical products are commercially available as shampoos, sprays, wipes and mousses. To date, no studies have evaluated the efficacy of commercially available mousse products in the treatment of canine pyoderma. To determine the residual antibacterial activity of canine hairs treated with mousse products containing different active ingredients. Fifteen client-owned dogs with no history of dermatological disease. Dogs were treated once with five mousse products [(i) 2% chlorhexidine and 1% ketoconazole, (ii) 2% chlorhexidine and 2% miconazole, (iii) 3% chlorhexidine and 0.5% climbazole, (iv) 2% salicylic acid 10% ethyl lactate and (v) phytosphingosine HCl 0.05%; control]. Hair samples were collected from each treatment area before application, one hour after application and on days 2, 4, 7, 10 and 14 post-treatment. Collected hairs were weighed and plated on Mueller-Hinton agar plates streaked with a Staphylococcus pseudintermedius isolate showing no antimicrobial resistance. Plates were incubated for 24 h and bacterial growth inhibition zones around the hairs were measured. Mousses 1, 2 and 3 created significant inhibition zones up to Day 10 when compared to pre-treatment samples. On Day 14, only mousse 3 produced a significant zone of inhibition when compared to the pre-treatment sample. Mousses 4 and 5 showed no statistical difference between any of the samples. These results suggest that three of the mousse products had residual activity in inhibiting S. pseudintermedius growth in vitro for at least 10 days.
