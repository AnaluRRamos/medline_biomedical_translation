The factors associated with health problems were ambulatory care sensitive conditions (p-value<0.001); education development index (p-value<0.001); temperature (p-value=0.019) and degree of urbanization (p-value=0.004). Diseases were associated with population density (p-value<0.001); temperature (p-value<0.001), humidity (p-value<0.001) and altitude (p-value=0.005). Health problems were positively associated with ambulatory care sensitive conditions, the education development index and temperature; but negatively associated with degree of urbanization.
