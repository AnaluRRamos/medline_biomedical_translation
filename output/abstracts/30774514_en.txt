To compare the accuracy of insertion of pedicle screws into the thoracic spine using fluoroscopic guidance or computer-assisted navigation techniques. Eight cadaveric thoracic spines were divided into two groups: the fluoroscopy group, in which pedicle screws were inserted with the guidance of a C-arm device, and the navigation group, in which insertion of the screws was monitored using computer-assisted navigation equipment. All procedures were performed by the same spinal surgeon. The rate of pedicle breach was compared between the two groups. There was one intra-canal perforation in each group. Both perforations were medial in direction, and the breaches were 2 to 4 mm deep. There were no statistically significant differences in breach rate between the two groups. The accuracy of insertion of pedicle screws in the thoracic spine using computer-assisted navigation is equivalent to that achieved using fluoroscopic guidance. Computer-assisted navigation improves the safety of the surgical team during the procedure due to the absence of exposure to radiation. Therefore, there is a need for future randomized controlled trials to be conducted in the clinical setting to evaluate other outcomes, including duration of surgery and blood loss during the procedure. <b><i>Level of evidence IV.</i></b>
