During adolescence, body image is linked to subjective well-being. This study aimed to identify variables related to overall well-being (life satisfaction, health perception, happiness, and optimism) that discriminate between teenagers who are satisfied with body image and those who are dissatisfied. A cross-sectional, school- based study was conducted involving a sample of 1,460 ninth-grade students attending state schools in Canoas in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The following instruments were used: a sociodemographic questionnaire; the Economic Classification Criteria Brazil; the Body Shape Questionnaire; the Brief Multidimensional Students' Life Satisfaction Scale; the Happiness Measures; and health perception and perceived optimism. The data was analyzed using univariate analysis and multiple discriminant analysis. A total of 1,091 participants (74.7%) were satisfied with their body image. The variables that contributed most to the discrimination between groups were sex (0.680), self satisfaction (0.644), health perception (0.630), and level of happiness with health (0.601). Adopting an approach where having a positive body image is seen as a key element of mental and physical health can help make health care services more accessible to adolescents and promote more effective and less regulatory care.
