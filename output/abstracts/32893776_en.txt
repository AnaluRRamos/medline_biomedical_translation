Small bowel intussusception is a rare complication after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, with few cases reported, and none in the immediate post-operative period of an abdominoplasty. We report the case of a 42-year-old woman, with an history of a laparoscopic Rouxen-Y gastric bypass, who developed small bowel occlusion secondary to a retrograde jejunojejunal intussusception in the second post-operative day of an abdominoplasty. This is the first report of a small bowel intussusception after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in the post-operative period of an abdominoplasty. Doubts remain about the possible causal effect abdominoplasty might have in small bowel intussusception after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.
