The aim of this study was to characterize the environments of Curitiba's state schools in relation to commercialization of alcoholic beverages and investigate the association with local socio-economic indicators. A cross-sectional study in commercial establishments was carried out around 30 state-owned schools. We applied a survey to characterize the locations in relation to the availability of alcoholic beverages. Differentiation between school environments regarding income was estimated by multilevel mixed-effects model. We evaluated 200 commercial establishments, 66.0% commercialized alcohol. Of them, 52 (39.4%) were off-premise alcohol outlets and 80 (60.6%) on-premise. In on-premise category, neighborhood markets (16.5%) and gas stations (10.1%) had higher presence and half of schools had this type of this establishment in their environment. These establishment had more variety of alcoholic beverages and lower prices. In school's environments located in lower income's neighborhoods, the number of neighborhood market and bars were higher. It was observed the presence of establishments that commercialized alcoholic beverages and with attendance to the public during the classes period, near the evaluated schools.
