To characterize cancellations of elective surgeries according to clinical and non-clinical reasons, as well as to verify seasonal influence and determine the estimated reduction of the index. Quantitative, descriptive and retrospective study with secondary data extracted from the Public Hospital of the State of SÃ£o Paulo database. Out of the 8,443 (100%) elective surgeries scheduled, 7,870 (93.21%) were performed and 573 (6.79%) were canceled. Out of these 573 (100%) people, 48.33% were canceled for clinical reasons and 46.40% were for non-clinical reasons. Among the non-clinical reasons for surgery cancellations, those related to medical reasons stood out: at the request of the surgeon/change of approach (17.93%), followed by non-hospitalized patient (8.96%). There was no indication of seasonality regarding the reasons for cancellation in the assessed period. Although the rate of elective surgeries cancellations is lower than that of other hospitals with similar characteristics, it is still possible to reduce it from 6.79% to 1.36%, considering that 80% of the reasons for cancellation are avoidable.
