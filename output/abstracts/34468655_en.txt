The objective of this study was to compare quality of life indicators and clinical parameters among individuals participating in a cardiovascular health promotion program in the supplementary health sector. We conducted a cross-sectional study with 251 program participants living in the regions covered by the Vale do Taquari and Vale do Rio Pardo regional development councils in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Quality of life was assessed using the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire. Participants were predominantly women and elderly and had high cardiovascular risk (37.8%) and good self-reported quality of life. The clinical parameter means were body mass index obesity class I, normal blood pressure and lipid profile and adequate fasting blood sugar level. The results of the reassessment after one year showed a significant reduction in mean triglycerides (p = 0.031), diastolic blood pressure (p = 0.000) and systolic blood pressure (p = 0.013), and a significant increase in the mean score for the general domain of the WHOQOL-BREF (p = 0.004). It is necessary to consider and address social determinants of health and promote integrated actions across various sectors, including both the public and private spheres.
