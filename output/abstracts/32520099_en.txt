To identify the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) self-reported in Brazil and characterize the factors associated with it. This study was a cross-sectional health survey with a household-based, the National Health Survey, performed in 2013. The outcome in the present study was the prevalence of CKD. The groups of explanatory variables were socio-demographic characteristics, lifestyles, chronic self-reported diseases, anthropometry, and health evaluation. The prevalence of CKD, e their 95% respective confidence interval were estimated, univariate analysis and the multiple logistic regression model were calculated, and remained the variables statistically significant (p < 0.05). It noticed that 1.42% (95%CI 1.33 - 1.52) of the 60,202 interviewees self-reported CKD. The OR increased progressively with age, being 2.68 among the elderly with 65 years or more (95%CI 1.75 - 4.09). Having health plans with OR = 1.51 (95%CI 1.28 - 1.78), as well as smoking, hypertension and high cholesterol and poor self-reported health with OR = 1.75 (95%CI 1.45 - 2.12), OR = 1.20 (95%CI 1.02 - 1.42), OR = 1.83 (95%CI 1.56 - 2.15), OR = 4.70 (95%CI 3.75 - 5.88), respectively, showed a higher chance of CKD. The associated variables were increasing age, health plan coverage, smoking, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and regular or poor health status. The knowledge of CKD prevalence in Brazil and risk and protection factors are essential for disease prevention and the establishment of supporting public health policies.
