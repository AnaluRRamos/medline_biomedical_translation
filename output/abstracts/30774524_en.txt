The aim of this study was to compare the differences in knee sensorimotor control between healthy men and women by measuring the joint position sense (JPS), sensation of muscle tension (steadiness), and onset of muscle activation (OMA). Twenty-four healthy women and 27 healthy men were tested. Knee sensorimotor control was assessed using the JPS test with electrogoniometers in 3 different ranges of motion, sensation of muscle tension using the isometric steadiness technique, and OMA against a mechanical perturbation. Each assessment was compared by sex, physical activity level, and right or left lower limb. The men obtained better values in the JPS test between 90º and 60º and between 30º and 0º than the women. The subjects with higher levels of physical activity also showed better values, between 90º and 60º and between 30º and 0º. The best results for steadiness were found in the women and the subjects with higher levels of physical activity. In the OMA test, no significant differences were found in the studied variables. The results suggest that higher levels of physical activity may determine better sensorimotor control. Men have better articular sensation, and women have better muscle strength control. <i><b>Level of evidence III, Cross sectional study.</b></i>
