The diagnosis and treatment of depression in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) is inadequate, often contributing to a reduced quality of life, rapid disease progression, higher cognitive impairment, and an increased burden of care for family members of patients with PD. To determine the factors associated with depression in PD and to examine the frequency of depressive symptoms among patients with PD. This study was an observational, analytical, multicenter study of a cross-sectional cohort, conducted between July 2016 and May 2017. PD patients were recruited from neurology clinics in Lima, Peru. All statistical analyses were performed using descriptive statistics. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were calculated using STATA. Out of 124 patients (average age: 68.7 years; 58% males) included in the study 60.5% (75/124) presented with symptoms of depression; only 20% (25/124) received antidepressants. Factors associated with depression in PD included: unemployment, falls, freezing of gait, involuntary movements micrographia, stooped posture, hyposmia, movement disorders in sleep, rapid disease progression, and the use of MAOIs. Furthermore, statistically significant differences were found in disease duration, UPDRS and MMSE scores, Hoehn and Yahr (HY) stage, and length of time taking L-dopa between PD patients with and without depressive symptoms. Factors associated with depressive symptoms in patients with PD were hyposmia, rapid progression of the disease, the use of L-dopa, and use of MAOIs. The frequency of depressive symptoms in patients with PD is high; early diagnosis and prompt treatment are needed to improve their quality of life and the family environment.
