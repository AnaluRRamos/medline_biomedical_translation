This paper aimed to identify food consumption differences as per healthy and unhealthy diet markers among adults living in Brazilian urban and rural areas. A cross-sectional study was performed with data from the National Health Survey (2013). Diet was assessed by using healthy and unhealthy diet markers. Prevalence (%) was estimated, and sequential logistic regression models were adjusted to estimate odds ratios (OR) and confidence intervals (95%CI). Urban areas evidenced a higher consumption of fruits and vegetables, fish, soft drinks, and meal replacement by snacks, while rural areas showed higher consumption of meat with excess fat and beans. Adjusted analyses showed higher regular consumption of beans and meat with excess fat; and lower consumption of soft drinks, fruits and vegetables and meal replacement by snacks in rural areas compared to urban areas. Similar trends were observed in the macro-regions of the country. Food consumption differences among Brazilians living in rural and urban areas denote the importance of fostering food policies that respect and value food traditions and culture.
