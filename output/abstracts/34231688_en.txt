Adverse effects on the physical and mental health of adolescents associated with excessive smartphone use have been reported. This paper aims to assess adolescent smartphone addiction and related factors in a region in Northeastern Brazil. This cross-sectional study was carried out in six State-run Professional Education Schools in Fortaleza, Cear√°, Brazil, from September to October 2019 with 286 adolescents aged 15-19 years who completed five data collection instruments. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess factors related to the outcome using SPSS version 23.0. Smartphone addiction prevalence rate was 70,3% and was associated with being underage (OR=0,583; p=0,001), fewer sleep hours (OR=0,715; p=0,020), longer use on weekends (OR=1,115; p=0,015), cervical pain (OR=2,206; p=0,020), and suspected common mental disorder (OR=1,272; p=0,000). A high smartphone addiction level was observed among adolescents in the sample and was related to multiple factors. Attention should be drawn to the importance of educational campaigns to guide adolescents, parents, educators, and health professionals about the risks of excessive smartphone use to the health of adolescents.
