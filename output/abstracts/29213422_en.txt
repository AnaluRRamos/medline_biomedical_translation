Alien hand syndrome consists of an autonomous motor activity perceived as an involuntary yet purposeful movement, with a feeling of foreignness of the involved limb, commonly associated with a failure to recognize ownership of the limb in the absence of visual cues. A 41 year old left-handed woman, HIV positive, evolved with loss of control in the left hand. Her left hand presented extravolitional movements, as if having a will of its own, not responding to commands such as opening a door or holding an umbrella, but instead groping unneeded objects. She had talked to her hand and even fought it. In addition, other clinical presentations including recent memory loss, hemineglect and dysphoria were observed. Computed tomography revealed a hypodensity area in the right frontal-parietal region, with midline deviation. Considering clinical and epidemiological data, the diagnosis of Central Nervous System (CNS) toxoplasmosis was reached. No previous reports showing association among AIDS, toxoplasmosis and alien hand syndrome were found.
