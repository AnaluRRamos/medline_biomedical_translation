To systematically review the efficacy of interventions on upper limb function in children 0 to 19Â years of age with bilateral cerebral palsy on the basis of outcome measures of upper limb function and measures of activities and/or participation according to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health. Cochrane, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and Web of Science were searched from inception to September 2017. Methodological quality and strength of evidence were analysed by two independent raters using Sackett's level of evidence and the American Academy for Cerebral Palsy and Developmental Medicine (AACPDM) guidelines. Fifteen studies with a large variety of interventions and heterogeneity in outcome measures met the inclusion criteria. Twelve studies provided level IV evidence according to AACPDM guidelines. For three small randomized controlled trials the level of evidence was II. Only one of these trials showed strong methodological quality: a study on hand-arm bimanual intensive therapy including lower extremities. We identified a large variety of interventions, heterogeneity in outcome measures, and generally weak to moderate methodological quality for most studies. We recommend further research specifically aimed at bimanual-intensive, goal-directed, and task-specific training programmes for the upper limb in children with bilateral cerebral palsy, using either high-quality (multicentre) trials or well-designed single-case trials. There is a large variety of interventions on upper limb function in children with bilateral cerebral palsy. Heterogeneity of outcome measures and interventions impeded firm conclusions about intervention efficacy. Most studies had low-level evidence and weak to moderate methodological quality. The strongest evidence from a small randomized controlled trial was for hand-arm bimanual intensive therapy including lower extremities.
