The scope of the study was to evaluate the temporal trend and spatial distribution of congenital syphilis (CS) in the state of Rio Grande do Sul. All cases reported by the SINASC/DATASUS between 2001 and 2012 were included. The number of live births was obtained from DATASUS. Incidence rates of CS were grouped according to micro-regions of IBGE and analyzed for the entire period and for triennia. The spatial correlation was analyzed by the global Moran index (I) and the local index. 3,613 cases were reported. Between 2007 and 2012 89 neonates (3.6%) died. Rates varied from to 1.03 in 2001 to 5.1 cases per 1000 live births in 2012, with an annual increase of 0.84 cases per 1000 live births (p < 0.01) and 93.88% of explained variance. The micro-regions were spatially independent (I = 0.06; p = 0.25), with Porto Alegre having the highest incidence (4.19 cases / 1000 live births) and JaguarÃ£o the lowest (0.23 cases / 1000 live births). Micro-regions with significant local spatial dependence were observed. The increase in cases of CS highlights poor prenatal quality care. Identification of the micro-regions with the highest incidence is essential to focus public policy on this health problem.
