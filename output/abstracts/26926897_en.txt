The proximal humeral fractures are becoming more frequent, with a greater tendency for its surgical treatment by osteosynthesis with plate and locked screws. The mechanical and biological failure in these fractures and devices, despite the evolution of this type of implants, highlighted the synthetic bone grafts became an option. Over a period of 96 months, patients considered were those with proximal humeral fractures treated surgically with a plate and locked screws, and in which β-tricalcium phosphate bone graft had been used. Functional results were evaluated by the shoulder range of motion as the radiological results. In 19 patients, with a medial follow up of 53 months, we obtained an average shoulder range of motion of 140º in abduction, 142º in forward flexion, 37º in external rotation and L3 hand position in internal rotation for a cefalo-diaphyseal angle of 136º. The β-tricalcium phosphate synthetic bone graft allows the maintenance of reduction after fixation of proximal humeral fractures stabilized with plate and locked screws. This reduction which means the maintenance of cefalo-diaphyseal angle is in close relationship with functional results as shown by shoulder range of motion in all planes. The β-tricalcium phosphate synthetic bone graft should be seen as an adjuvant therapy in extramedullary fixation of proximal humeral fractures, especially those with greater comminution of the medial calcar.
