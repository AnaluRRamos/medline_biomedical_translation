To understand the care by men in situations of chronic illness of one or more of his children, based on the dimensions of care. It was based on a comprehensive approach and on the (re)view of the database of the matrix research to which the study is linked, with emphasis on three experiences of illness, in which the men effectively participated in the family care: two children with sickle cell anemia; son with adrenoleukodystrophy and son with concomitant diseases (cancer and kidney disease). The analysis diagram of each family demonstrated different ways of caring, explaining the relationship between the dimensions of care by men: social; affective/relational and physical/circulation, as well as the reverberations between these dimensions in the care. This understanding is important for health professionals to consider and respect the personalities, dignity and particularities of each family. It also gave visibility to care that has been significantly provided by man, thus supporting him in this process.
