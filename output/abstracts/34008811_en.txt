Walking training (WT) improves walking capacity and reduces clinic blood pressure (BP) in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD), but its effects on ambulatory BP remains unknown. To investigate the effect of 12 weeks of WT on ambulatory BP and its variability in patients with PAD. Thirty-five male patients with PAD and claudication symptoms were randomly allocated into two groups: control (n = 16, 30 min of stretching) and WT (n = 19, 15 bouts of 2 min of walking at the heart rate of leg pain threshold interspersed by 2 min of upright rest). Before and after 12 weeks, 24-hour ambulatory BP was assessed. Ambulatory BP variability indices assessed at both time points included the 24-hour standard deviation (SD<sub>24</sub>), the awake and asleep weighted standard deviation (SD<sub>dn</sub>), and the 24-hour average real variability (ARV<sub>24</sub>). Data were analyzed by mixed two-way ANOVAs, considering P<0.05 as significant. After 12 weeks, neither group had significant changes in 24-hour, awake and sleep BPs. The WT decreased systolic and mean BP variabilities (Systolic BP – 13.3±2.8 vs 11.8±2.3, 12.1±2.84 vs 10.7±2.5 and 9.4±2.3 vs 8.8±2.2 mmHg); Mean BP – 11.0±1.7 vs 10.4±1.9, 10.1±1.6 vs 9.1±1.7 and 8.0.±1.7 vs 7.2±1.5 mmHg) for SD<sub>24,</sub> SD<sub>dn</sub> and ARV<sub>24</sub>, respectively). Neither group had significant changes in diastolic BP variabilities after 12 weeks. The WT does not change ambulatory BP levels but decreases ambulatory BP variability in patients with PAD. This improvement may have a favorable impact on the cardiovascular risk of patients with symptomatic PAD. (Arq Bras Cardiol. 2021; 116(5):898-905)
