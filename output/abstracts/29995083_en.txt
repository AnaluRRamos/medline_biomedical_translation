To evaluate the calibration and discrimination of APACHE IV in the postoperative period after kidney transplantation. This clinical cohort study included 986 hospitalized adult patients in the immediate postoperative period after kidney transplantation, in a single center in southern Brazil. Kidney transplant patients who died in hospital had significantly higher APACHE IV values and higher predicted mortality. The APACHE IV score showed adequate calibration (H-L 11.24 p = 0.188) and a good discrimination ROC curve of 0.738 (95%CI 0.643 - 0.833, p < 0.001), although SMR overestimated mortality (SMR = 0.73; 95%CI: 0.24 - 1.42, p = 0.664). The APACHE IV score showed adequate performance for predicting hospital outcomes in the postoperative period for kidney transplant recipients.
