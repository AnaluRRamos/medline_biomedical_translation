Describe the distribution of the nursing workforce in countries of the Region of the Americas and the relation between the number of human resources in nursing and maternal mortality ratios. Descriptive and exploratory analysis of 27 countries of the Region. The variables in the study were the proportion of health professionals per country and subregion; professional category; and nurse-to-physician ratio. The maternal mortality ratio was used as an overall indicator of the health of the population to analyze its relationship to the number of nurses. Frequency distribution and density of human resources in nursing were analyzed per country and subregion. The distribution of nursing personnel was heterogeneous. Some countries had more than 80 nurses per 10 000 population and others had fewer than five professionals per 10 000 population. In 34.1% of the countries, the nurse-to-physician ratio was less than 1. Differences in the distribution of nursing personnel were observed between regions and subregions, and within countries. In several countries, the number of nurses per capita was less than expected. The majority of the countries showed a significantly lower proportion of licensed nurses with respect to technical and auxiliary personnel. It is necessary to implement initiatives to increase the number of licensed nurses throughout the Region.
