Alzheimer's disease (AD) and epilepsy are common disorders in the elderly. Evidence demonstrates that patients with AD have an increased risk of developing epilepsy and seizures. To review epidemiological, clinical and treatment aspects of epilepsy and AD. We reviewed databases (PubMED, LiLACS, Scielo) conducting a search for manuscripts using the terms Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy. Manuscripts related to the areas of interest were reviewed. Studies revealed that epilepsy is more frequent among AD patients. The combined presence of the two disorders may be related to mechanisms of neuronal hyperexcitability as a consequence of amyloid-beta protein (AÎ²) or phosphorylated tau accumulation, as well as to structural changes in cortical and hippocampal regions. Available data suggest that the new generation of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are better tolerated in the elderly population, and may also be the best option in patients with AD and epilepsy. Further prospective studies involving evaluation of concomitant dementia and epilepsy, neurophysiological findings and biomarkers need to be performed.
