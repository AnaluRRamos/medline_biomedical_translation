To analyze and to compare fluency parameters in spontaneous speech and reading and reading comprehension of school-age children who stutter and who do not stutter. Cross-sectional and prospective study approved by the Research Ethics Committee. Sample consisted of 30 scholars aged 8 and 11 years and 11 months divided into two groups: Study Group with 15 school-age children who stutter, Control Group with 15 school-age children who do not stutter. Participants underwent fluency evaluation of spontaneous speech, reading of expository and narrative texts, and reading comprehension evaluation. Inferential statistical analysis was conducted using the Mann-Whitney tests and correlation analysis was conducted using the Spearman's Coefficient test. The comparison between the fluency parameters indicated that school-age children who stutter showed a greater amount of stuttering-like disfluencies, while school-age children who do not stutter showed longer flows of syllables and words per minute, in spontaneous speech and reading. Regarding reading comprehension, school-age children who stutter had lower performance than school-age children who do not stutter in both texts. There was no association between the frequency of disfluencies and reading comprehension in school-age children who stutter and who do not stutter. School-age children who stutter showed impairments in reading comprehension when compared to fluent, since there was no association between the frequencies of disfluencies with reading comprehension for both groups. It is suggested that reading comprehension be evaluated and, if necessary, improved in order to reduce the consequences of stuttering and provide learning of this school-age children.
