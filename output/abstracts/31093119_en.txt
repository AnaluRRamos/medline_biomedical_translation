Health policymakers in the Caribbean face challenges with research use in decision-making. Although copious approaches to strengthen evidence-informed policy can be found in the literature, these strategies should be applied and evaluated in specific settings. We developed a theory of change for strengthening research uptake in health policy, and the interventions were implemented as the Evidence Informed Decision Making Network of the Caribbean (EvIDeNCe). We assessed the model's logic and evaluated whether the expected outcome was achieved. The model was mapped in three stages: problem identification; goal determination; and backward linking of interventions. Beneficiaries were surveyed to assess the design logic and to evaluate the main outcome. A total of 137 respondents completed evaluation questionnaires. The inclusion of evidence briefs, stakeholder dialogues, a research database, and training programs for policymakers in the model was validated. Respondents also reported their intention to act on research evidence to which they were exposed. After respondents had participated in stakeholder dialogues, the mean intention-to-use score was 6.4 on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree), and 6.3 on the same scale, after exposure to training. This work provides initial validation of EvIDeNCe as a consolidated strategy to strengthen the application of research in policy in the Caribbean. To our knowledge, it is the first study to develop and apply a comprehensive model of this type to the Caribbean. The findings support results from similar initiatives in other countries, but additional work is needed to evaluate the overall impact of the initiative.
