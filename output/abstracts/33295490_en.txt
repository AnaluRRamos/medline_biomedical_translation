This paper analyzes Journal Ciência & Saúde Coletiva's approach to the narrative field. The concept of 'narrative field' is built on the relationships of three dimensions, namely, the cognitive (epistemic), the socio-political-pedagogical, and the applied. This is an analytical, quantitative, and qualitative research of authors, themes, theoretical and methodological approaches, concepts, and disciplines. The search on the SciELO database was developed in two stages: 1. Context - Restricted to the health publications, research on 29/01/2019, with the Portuguese descriptor 'narrativa' + 'saúde' (without filter); 2. Bibliometric research - data collected in December 2019 using descriptor 'narrative' + 'ciência e saúde coletiva', period 2002-2019. No reference was found in the searched journal before 2002. In the analysis of the 43 texts, the keywords were grouped into narrative analyses, narrative reviews, narrative texts, biography, and translation. We conclude by affirming the relevance of the theme, despite the small number of works, and suggest scholars emphasize in future works the theoretical approaches of narrative work and demarcate their perspectives, as an approach or an object, or both.
