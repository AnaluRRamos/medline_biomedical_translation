In 1958, Eiseman and contributors published the first scientific paper reporting the use of fecal microbiota transplant for treating pseudomembranous colitis. The relevance of this innovative paper was only acknowledged in 1990. The academic literature on the theme is characterized by a narrative that has undergone successive revisions. We suggest that such revisions were based on claims of priority of scientific discoveries, as described by Merton. The revival of fecal microbiota transplants is interpreted as a process of genesis of a scientific fact, as defined by Fleck: there is a switch from a thought style based on the use of antibiotics to treat infectious diseases to another that accepts the ecological relations between hosts, vectors and parasites.
