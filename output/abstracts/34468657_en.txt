The scope of this study was to analyze the relationship of an instrument of family vulnerability with sociodemographic, dental, and spatial distribution in a given territory. The dependent variable was the classification of family vulnerability, proposed by Coelho and Savassi. The independent variables were selected on the basis of the theoretical model proposed by Andersen. Hierarchical multiple logistic regression models were estimated. Kernel density estimation was used for spatial analysis. Subjects who lived with more than 4 people (OR = 3.46; 95% CI), who were dissatisfied with their oral health (OR = 2.38; 95% CI), who were ashamed to smile and talk (OR = 3.03, 95% CI) were more likely to be 'at risk' in the family. Spatial analysis enabled the visualization of an area of ​​higher concentration of families 'at risk'. The relationship of the instrument of vulnerability analyzed with sociodemographic and dental factors, as well as the assistance in the visualization and identification of more vulnerable areas, are useful in the knowledge of the territory for the planning of actions in oral health, and the conclusion drawn is that the tool can be adopted for more equitable access by the oral health teams.
