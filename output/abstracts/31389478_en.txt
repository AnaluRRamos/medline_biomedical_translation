To evaluate the quality of Primary Health Care according to the level of satisfaction of elderly users. An exploratory-descriptive study, with a quantitative approach, performed with 381 elderly users of Primary Health Care. For data collection, the Service Quality scale (SERVQUAL) was adapted to the context of the Primary Health Units (UBS) of Family Health Strategy (ESF) and a questionnaire with 44 questions was elaborated. Data was treated using SSPSÂ® and analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistical techniques. the SERVQUAL subscales 'expectations' and 'perceptions' exhibited excellent reliability and internal consistency, with Cronbach's Alpha 0.948 and 0.932, respectively. The evaluated dimensions presented negative Gaps results: tangible aspects -0.65, reliability -1.19, responsiveness -0.56, guarantee -0.91, and empathy -0.52. negative Gaps in all dimensions show gaps in the quality of services and demonstrates the low satisfaction of the elderly users of UBS/ESF/APS.
