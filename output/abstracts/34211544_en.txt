Primary or secondary bone tumors can manifest in different ways, from simple bone pain to possible pathological fractures. Hypervascularized tumors are of greatest concern, with increased incidence of complications. Preoperative embolization of the bone tumor is an effective measure for reducing blood loss during open surgery to excise the tumor. With appropriate experience, the risks of the procedure are minimal and final outcomes are highly satisfactory. The purpose of this paper is to describe the case of a 43-year-old male patient with a metastatic renal cell tumor in the left proximal femur (seen on lower limb computed tomography) who underwent selective preoperative embolization. The procedure resulted in a remarkable absence of bleeding and successful response to subsequent onco-orthopedic surgery.
