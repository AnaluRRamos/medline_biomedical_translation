To investigate the temporal trend of practicing physical exercise and sports during leisure time in adults in São Paulo between 2006 to 2016. Time series analysis study using the VIGITEL System. Adding up the number of people who participated each year, a total 21,357 people were studied. Analyzes of the physical exercises and sports practiced during leisure time (yes or no) stratified by sex, age and education were performed. The prevalences and the differences for all of the years were calculated using the Prains-Winster regression. Practice of physical exercises or sports increased by 7.9 percentage points in the period (p = 0.003) (from 39.9% 95%CI 37.4 - 42.4 to 47.8% 95%CI 45.2 - 50.4). There was a significant increase for women (p = 0.011), for people between 18-24 years old (p = 0.001), 25-34 years old (p = 0.003), 45-54 years old (p = 0.003), and for people with up to eight years of schooling (p = 0.010). There was a decrease in walking and playing soccer and there was an increase in doing gymnastics. There was an increase in the practice of physical exercise and sports during leisure time in adults from São Paulo. These increases were observed mainly in women, in people between 18 and 34 years old, between 45 and 54 years old, and in people with up to eight years of schooling. These results are important, as they have shown an increase in general and in more vulnerable groups, and may be related to environmental changes and interventions that have occurred in the city in the last 15 years.
