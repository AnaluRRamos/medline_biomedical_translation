This study aims to identify information systems having fatal work-related (ATF) data in Brazil, describing their characteristics, flows and barriers to information quality. Using a documental research approach, we found: the Mortality Information System (SIM), the Hospital Admission Register from the Unified Health System (SIH-SUS), the Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN) and the Violence and Injuries Surveillance Program (VIVA) from the Health Ministry; the Work-related Injuries Reporting System (SISCAT) of the Ministry of Social Insurance; and the Annual Report of Social Information (RAIS), Ministry of Labour and Employment. A lack of key common variables limits the construction of a single database composed by all ATF recorded cases. From several barriers identified, the most relevant for data quality was the lack of work-relatedness recognition and recording, a task performed by the health team.
