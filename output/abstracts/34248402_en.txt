The aim of this study is to assess the economic impact of the new coronavirus (COVID-19) on Brazilian Orthopaedic Surgeons. The questionnaire was applied to orthopedists and it questions how long they have worked in this area; their monthly financial impact during the pandemic; what sector was impacted the most; if they had or didn't have any financial reserves and how long they would last; if they had any other source of fixed income; and how much time off they had taken from work. It was entirely anonymous and it could only be answered once. About 98% (955 out of 975) of the analyzed orthopedists suffered some monetary impact, 80% had a financial reserves, from which 45% could last for 3 months. There was a direct relationship between the professional experience in this subspecialty and a higher percentage of fixed income, as well as a greater impact on the reduction percentage in the monthly budget and a longer time off the job. <b><i>Level of Evidence IV, Analyses with no sensitivity analyses.</i></b>
