Identify the beliefs related to adherence to diet of patients treated with oral anticoagulant. Descriptive study, guided by the Theory of Reasoned Action, conducted with 57 patients in continuous use of oral anticoagulants, attended at a general cardiology outpatient clinic in Jo√£o Pessoa and specialized in anticoagulation in Recife. Data were collected from February to May 2017, with an application form with open questions, through an interview, and submitted to a descriptive analysis. The most mentioned positive behavioral beliefs were to improve health/treatment in the general outpatient clinic and to control coagulation, in the specialized service. Children, spouses, doctors, and parents stood out proportionally in both scenarios as positive normative beliefs. In the outpatient clinic specializing in oral anticoagulation, patients add more specific beliefs about the interference of vitamin K-rich diet on coagulation, when compared to those in the general cardiology outpatient clinic.
