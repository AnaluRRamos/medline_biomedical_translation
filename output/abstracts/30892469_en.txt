The lack of availability of the Therasuit Method by the Unified Health System associated with its high cost has led to the prosecution of this treatment. The study aimed to outline the profile of this judicialization, as well as to estimate the direct costs resulting from compliance with the deferred judicial decisions. Weanalyzed the cases submitted to the Court of Justice of Rio de Janeiro between January 2013 and January 2017, in which the Therasuit Method was applied. Demographic, clinical, advocacy and legal data were extracted, as was the timing of the court's decision and the required technology budgets. Atotal of 11 processes was analyzed. The authors had a mean age of 6.8 years and a median of 6, the majority being male, and resident in thestate capital. Quadriparesis was the most reported condition. The gratuity of justice was requested by all, and the Public Defender's Officewas used by 9 of the 11 processes. The judicial decisions at first instance were considered. In all of processes there was application of the legal tool called guardianship. The time of the judicial decision was on average of 266.5 days with a median of 35.5. The deferral index was 90%, totaling an annual direct cost of R$501,894.09. The judicialization of this treatment can cause an unforeseen displacement of public funds, transgressing the principles of equity and the integrality of Unified Health System. It was observed a high rate of deferred processes, resulting in a high cost spent by the Public Power to attend a small portion of patients.
