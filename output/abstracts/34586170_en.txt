This study aimed to examine the association between frailty syndrome and the perception of problems in indicators of attributes in primary healthcare (PHC) among elderly Brazilians. This was a cross-sectional study with 5,432 participants 60 years or older in the first wave of the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brasil), conducted in 2015 and 2016. Frailty, the independent variable, was defined according to the theoretical framework of the frailty phenotype, and the indicators of problems in PHC attributes, the dependent variables, were obtained from questions related to health services use. Access, longitudinal care, coordination, comprehensiveness, family orientation, and cultural adequacy were the target attributes. For the data analysis, logistic regression models were used, adjusted for predisposing, enabling, and need factors for use of health services. Among the participants, 55.1% were females, 57.9% were 60 to 69 years of age, and 51.8% reported multimorbidity. Frail and pre-frail elders accounted for 13.4% and 54.5% of the sample, respectively. Multivariate analyses showed that frail elders (compared to robust elders) showed higher odds of reporting problems with access (OR = 1.45; 95%CI: 1.08-1.93), longitudinal care (OR = 1.54; 95%CI: 1.19-2.00), and comprehensive care (OR = 1.45; 95%CI: 1.14-1.85), in addition to more problems with attributes of PHC (OR = 1.38; 95%CI: 1.05-1.82, for 5 or more). The study suggests the occurrence of inequities in the care provided by Brazilian PHC for frail elders, particularly in the attributes of access, longitudinal care, and comprehensiveness.
