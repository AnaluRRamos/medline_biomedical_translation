This is a qualitative study based on the theoretical-methodological assumptions of the Conversation Analysis (CA) that describes and analyzes face-to-face interactions between three nurses and seven users of primary health care services during the cytopathological test collection visits. The descriptions and analyses were based on excerpts from the audio-recorded interactions during the nursing visits and transcribed based on the CA conventions. Data microanalysis from an emic perspective allowed identifying interactional situations of (mis)alignment, (dis)affiliation, repairs, and sensitive issues, and lack of listening to specific topics by nurses while conducting visits. Thus, signs of suffering, malaise, or violence were not explored, and care was not enhanced. The study shows that the cytopathological test collection visit can be a space to listen to issues related to sexuality and investigate the presence of violence against women. The dissemination of these findings and this methodology among public health and nursing professionals may stimulate a reflection on their communicative abilities, contributing to improved quality of care in health services.
