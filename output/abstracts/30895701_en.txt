Sarcoptic mange in free-ranging raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) caused by Sarcoptes scabiei is a widespread zoonotic disease that causes severe skin lesions with significant morbidity and mortality. Fluralaner is a member of the isoxazoline chemical class and is an acaricide and insecticide widely used in flea, tick and mite infections of dogs (Canis lupus familiaris). To evaluate the clinical efficacy of orally administered fluralaner in free-ranging raccoon dogs naturally infected with sarcoptic mange. Six raccoon dogs rescued at the Seoul Wildlife Center between November 2017 and April 2018. Raccoon dogs were treated with a single dose of a chewable fluralaner tablet. Clinical lesion scoring and superficial skin scraping were performed weekly for three weeks to assess treatment efficacy; the general health was assessed daily to monitor response and observe any adverse drug reactions. Within seven days of treatment, a marked reduction in skin lesions was observed and mites were no longer present in skin scrapings. There was no evidence of re-infestation and no additional drug administration was required. Although this was a nonrandomized, uncontrolled study of a small number of animals, it demonstrated that fluralaner may be suitable for treating sarcoptic mange in raccoon dogs.
