The study investigated the prevalence of functional capacity decline and its associated factors in the older people enrolled in the Family Health Strategy (ESF) in a city in the south of Minas Gerais. This is an observational, cross-sectional, population-based study with 406 elderly (70.49 years Â± 6.77). The functional capacity was evaluated by the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), and its associated factors were evaluated by a structured questionnaire including sociodemographic, economic, clinical and physical aspects. The analysis of plasma levels of inflammatory mediators was performed by the ELISA method. Multiple linear regression was used for the analyses (p < 0.05). The prevalence of functional decline in the sample was 57.6% and factors associated with functional capacity were advanced age, female gender, number of medications, depressive symptoms, high plasma concentrations of the soluble receptor of tumor necrosis factor alpha 1 (sTNFR1) and low handgrip strength. The results demonstrated that functional capacity was associated with a network of multidimensional factors. This study contributes to the practice of ESF professionals by indicating the main factors that can guide actions to promote and prevent the decline of functional capacity in the elderly population.
