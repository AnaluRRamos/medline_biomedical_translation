This study presents an overview of public sector interventions and progress made on the women's and child health front in Brazil between 1990 and 2015. We analyzed indicators of antenatal and labor and delivery care and maternal and infant health status using data from the Live Birth Information System and Mortality Information System, national surveys, published articles, and other sources. We also outline the main women's and child health policies and intersectoral poverty reduction programs. There was a sharp fall in fertility rates; the country achieved universal access to antenatal and labor and delivery care services; access to contraception and breastfeeding improved significantly; there was a reduction in hospital admissions due to abortion and in malnutrition. The rates of congenital syphilis, caesarean sections and preterm births remain excessive. Under-five mortality decreased by more than two-thirds, but less pronounced for the neonatal component. The maternal mortality ratio decreased from 143.2 to 59.7 per 100 000 live births. Despite worsening scores or levelling off across certain health indicators, the large majority improved markedly.
