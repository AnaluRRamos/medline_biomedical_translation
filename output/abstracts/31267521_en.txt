To develop an assessment tool that measures a wide range of visual perceptual deficits common in cerebral visual impairment (CVI) and to provide normative data from typically developing children between 3 and 6 years of age. Test development reflected cross-talk between vision research and clinical relevance for CVI. The Children's Visual Impairment Test for 3- to 6-year-olds (CVIT 3-6) includes 14 subtests covering four domains of visual perception: Object Recognition, Degraded Object Recognition, Motion Perception, and Global-Local Processing. Normative data were collected from 301 typically developing children (mean age 4y 8mo [SD 9.7mo]; 148 females, 153 males). A questionnaire was administered to parents about pregnancy duration, birth, and developmental problems. Average total CVIT 3-6 performance was 60.1 (SD 5.5) out of 70. The cut-off score for normal visual perception (53) was set at the 10th centile of scores in typically developing children. Multiple regression indicated CVIT 3-6 visual perception scores increase with age for children born at 36 weeks' gestational age or later (β=-18.03, 95% confidence interval -31.31 to -4.75). CVIT 3-6 is a tool to assess a wide range of visual perceptual deficits common in CVI. Age-dependent normative data are available because we found performance increased with age. A test for visual perceptual deficits common in cerebral visual impairment. Visual perceptual functions improve with age in full-term typically developing children.
