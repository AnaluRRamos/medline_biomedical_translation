Cannabidiol (CBD) in hemp oil has become a widely used product in veterinary medicine. To date, there have been no reports of cutaneous adverse events associated with CBD-containing oil in the veterinary literature. A 4-year-old castrated male Labrador retriever presented with pad sloughing and rapidly progressive cutaneous and mucosal ulceration within five days of administering an oral CBD oil product. Histopathological findings in combination with cutaneous signs were consistent with Stevens-Johnson syndrome. All lesions completely resolved after discontinuation of the hemp oil in addition to a 12 day course of cephalexin and prednisone. Given the lack of alternative causes including other medications, an adverse drug event was deemed probable according to the Naranjo algorithm. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of suspected cutaneous adverse drug reaction to a CBD-containing hemp oil product.
