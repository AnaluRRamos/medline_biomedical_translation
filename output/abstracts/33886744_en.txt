To present the Trans Ambulatory Vocal Protocol (AVP-trans) and the Vocal Redesignation Program (VRP-trans). The protocol consists of the following steps: 1) user routing; 2) speech therapy evaluation, application of self-perception protocols, referral for otorhinolaryngological evaluation and definition of conduct: individualized therapy (sound source) or VRP-trans for vocal filter; 3) VRP-trans, containing 12 vocal parameters to be worked monthly individually and in a group with the users; 4) After the end of the VRP-trans, the user is referred for vocal re-evaluation and otorhinolaryngological re-evaluation, in which it will be observed if the objective of the vocal redesignation was reached. VRP-trans is a program that aims at developing a vocal filter work for the transgender population, flexible and that contemplates the complaints of this population, in which it presents difficulties to access the health service. AVP-trans and VRP-trans are tools that can subsidize the speech therapy for transgender people in Brazil, outlining mechanisms that allow greater confidence for transgenders in search of social passiveness through voice, minimizing transphobia, establishing comfort and social acceptance.
