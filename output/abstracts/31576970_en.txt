Map specific skills of the Wound Navigator. A scoping review of complete and free articles in the databases CINAHL®, Nursing & Allied Health Collection, Cochrane Plus Collection, MedicLatina, MEDLINE® and 12 specialist associations in tissue viability, references in Portuguese, English, Spanish and French, with no time limit. Realized by two researchers in August 2017, of the 746 articles found, 19 met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Four competency domains were identified: care (prevention/treatment of wounds and advanced therapies, decision-making; empowerment and clinical supervision), quality (specialized training; peer qualification; research and audit), and leadership (change agent; teamwork and consultant) and management (material selection/cost control). With four areas of competences, the Wound Navigator in partnership focuses on redefining people's life plans in the presence of wounds.
