Nerve transfers are an alternative in the reconstruction of traumatic brachial plexus injuries. In this study, we report the results of branchial plexus reconstruction using accessory to suprascapular nerve transfer. Thirty-three patients with traumatic brachial plexus injuries underwent surgical reconstruction with accessory to suprascapular nerve transfers. The patients were divided into groups in which surgery was performed either within 6 months after the injury or more than 6 months after the injury. Results were assessed using the Constant score. There was no significant difference between the groups with respect to the Constant score. Accessory to suprascapular nerve transfer was not an efficient method for recovering active ROM or strength in the shoulder. However, it effectively improved pain control and shoulder stability. <b>Level of evidence II, Retrospective Study.</b>
