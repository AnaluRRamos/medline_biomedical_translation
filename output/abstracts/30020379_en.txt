Under the Troika Memorandum (2011-2015), health policies in Portugal know a political agenda, business and organizational schedule guided by the principles of privatisation, deregulation and underfinancing of public services by the State. In this article, the authors provide a review of the literature on health systems in the countries of the Southern European countries, highlighting the Portuguese situation regarding reform processes and major health inequalities before and during the economic crisis. Complementarily, the testimonies of different professionals of the health sector (doctor, nurse, therapeutics technician, unions and heads of care units) are summoned. Based on an exploratory study, it is our purpose to discuss political-organisational transformations and their consequences in the deregulation and precariousness of labour relations in the health sector. Wage reductions, career freeze, contractual instability, professional demotivation, intensification of the work pace and disqualification of services are some of the most visible signs of a management agenda that conflicts with the missions of a universal National Health System (NHS) at the service of Portuguese society.
