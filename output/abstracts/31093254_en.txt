To describe partnerships that Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) Collaborating Centers in Nursing and Midwifery have in Haiti, and their contribution to promoting universal health coverage in that country. In 2017, semistructured interviews were conducted by telephone or email to update the status of activities and collaborations that were mentioned in a 2016 report (which covered efforts prior to early 2016) by the office of the Regional Advisor on Nursing and Allied Health Personnel at PAHO/WHO. Using that information, two of the authors categorized the Collaborating Center activities into focal areas. Six of the nine Collaborating Centers mentioned in the 2016 PAHO/WHO report participated in the 2017 semistructured interviews. The five focal areas identified were: 1) direct care/primary health care, 2) research, 3) workforce development, 4) curriculum development, and 5) shared educational activities. Current PAHO/WHO Nursing and Midwifery Collaborating Center partnerships in Haiti support universal health access and coverage through direct provision of care with ongoing Haiti-based clinics; research in topics relevant to Haitian partners; assistance with continuing education for nurses; and shared educational activities. These efforts are enhanced through partnerships with Haitian organizations and the Ministry of Public Health and Population. Coordination among PAHO/WHO Collaborating Centers could augment individual schools' efforts to assist health providers and institutions in Haiti to improve health outcomes and support universal health coverage.
