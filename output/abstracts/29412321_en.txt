The study aimed to analyze the costs of medical care for mental disorders in the Mexican health system. This was a retrospective cross-sectional evaluation study. As markers for the problem, the study selected two of the principal psychological processes in mental disorders in recent years: depression and schizophrenia. Annual accumulated incidence was identified based on epidemiological reporting by type of institution in 2005-2013. The mean annual case management cost was determined with the instrumentation and consensus technique, identifying the production functions, types of inputs, costs, and amounts of inputs ordered, concentrated in the mean case matrix. Finally, an econometric adjustment factor was applied to control the inflationary effect for each year in the study period. Mean annual case management cost was USD 2,216.00 for schizophrenia and USD 2,456.00 for depression. All the institutions in the Mexican health system showed upward and constant epidemiological and economic trends. The total cost for the two disorders in the last year of the period (2013) was USD 39,081,234.00 (USD 18,119,877.00 for schizophrenia and USD 20,961,357.00 for depression). The largest impact for the two disorders combined was in institutions serving the population without health insurance (USD 24,852,321.00) versus the population with private insurance (USD 12,891,977.00). The cost of meeting the demand for services for the two disorders differs considerably between institutions that treat the population with private health service versus the population without, and is higher in the latter. The study's epidemiological and economic indicators provide evidence for decision-making in the use and allocation of healthcare resources for these two disorders in the coming years.
