To analyze the trend of notifications of gestational and congenital syphilis in Minas Gerais, Brazil, from 2009 to 2019. This was an ecological time series study which took the state of Minas Gerais as its unit of analysis, based on data reported on the Notifiable Health Conditions Information System (SINAN). The Prais-Winsten autoregressive model was used to verify trends. 20,348 cases of gestational syphilis and 11,173 cases of congenital syphilis were reported. Average percentage annual increase was 36.7% (95%CI 32.5;41.0), for gestational syphilis incidence rates, and 32.8% (95%CI 28.0;37.8) for congenital syphilis incidence rates (p<0.001). The temporal trend analysis showed that gestational and congenital syphilis incidence rates had significant increasing trends, which may be related to inadequate treatment or failure to treat syphilis during pregnancy.
