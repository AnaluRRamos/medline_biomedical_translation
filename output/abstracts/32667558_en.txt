This study aimed to examine the factors associated with body dissatisfaction in adolescents. This is a cross-sectional study with students from two public and four private schools in the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro. Body dissatisfaction was evaluated using the Body Silhouette Scale, by the difference between the image they perceive as their current image and the one they would like to have. The association was assessed by hierarchical logistic regression multinomial model, by estimating odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Among the 1,019 adolescents evaluated (13-19 years), 75% showed body dissatisfaction, 41.4% wishing for a smaller silhouette and 33.7% wishing for larger silhouettes. The wish for a smaller silhouette was more significant in girls, overweight adolescents, those with an unsatisfactory meal pattern, and with higher waist circumference. Adolescents that had been exposed to teasing due to their body shape increased the probability of wishing for both smaller and larger silhouettes. Strategies are required for a more positive perception of body image, especially for girls and for overweight adolescents, which provide guidance on adequate meal consumption and prevent exposure to peer teasing, valuing coexistence and well-being in the face of existing bodily differences.
