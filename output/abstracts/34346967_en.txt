The aim of this study is to analyze and critically reflect on childhood cancer survival, including conceptual aspects, repercussions, survival care, and challenges. This is a theoretical and reflective study, based on the scientific literature on the subject and on the researchers' experience. Childhood cancer survival is conceptualized as the process of living beyond the oncological diagnosis. A person is considered a cancer survivor from the diagnosis until the end of life and is at high risk of experiencing physical, psychosocial, and economic effects. Therefore, survival care shall minimize, as far as possible, these impacts throughout life. Such care includes an action plan to track and treat the persistent effects of therapy, preventing diseases and promoting healthy behaviors, not being restricted to monitoring oncological recurrence. In the national setting, challenges persist, such as the scarcity of policies to guide comprehensive, good quality, and coordinated survival care. Despite these challenges, the nurse occupies a privileged position and is competent to implement survival care and manage the effects related to cancer treatment.
