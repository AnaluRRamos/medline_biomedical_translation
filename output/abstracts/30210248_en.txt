The objective of this paper was to study the anatomical variations of the flexor carpi radialis muscle (FCR) and determine in cadaver limbs whether the FCR nervous branch can be connected to the posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) without tension and how close to the target muscles the transfer can be performed. Thirty cadaveric upper limbs were dissected. The FCR received exclusive innervation of the median nerve, distally to the intercondylar line of the humerus. In 5 limbs, an isolated branch was found and in 25, a common trunk with other nervous branches occurred. We investigated whether the branch for the FCR was long enough to be transferred to the PIN. The diameter of the nerve branch for the FCR corresponded on average to 50% of the PIN. In 12 limbs, the branch destined to the FCR could be connected to the PIN, distally to the nerve branches to the supinator muscle even during the movements of the forearm and the elbow. In 18 specimens, it was necessary to mobilize the PIN for this innervation. <b><i>Level of Evidence IV, Case Series.</i></b>
