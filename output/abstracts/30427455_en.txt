The addition of fluoride to the public water supply is a method used for reducing tooth decay. In this sense, the control of fluoridation is important for maintaining its efficiency and, at the same time, for avoiding the risk of fluorosis as a result of the consumption of water with excess of fluoride. The objective of this study was to evaluate the adequacy of fluoride levels in the water distributed to populations of the state of Goiás, Brazil. Towards this aim, 5,039 water samples collected between 2011 and 2013 in 225 municipalities of the state of Goiás were analyzed for fluoride level. The results were assessed with regard to season, type of water source and geographic location. Fluoride levels were found to vary between complete absence and 2.5 mg F/L, with 28.2% of the samples being between 0.6 and 0.8 mg F/L, and 39.1% between 0.55 and 0.84 mg F/L. The rainy season produced a greater number of atypical results and higher values than the dry period. The systems supplied by groundwater sources were shown to have a limited control of fluoride concentration compared to systems supplied by surface water sources. Lower concentrations of fluoride were found in samples collected in the North and East Mesoregions of Goiás, with less than 7.5% being between 0.6 and 0.8 mg F/L, which systems are mainly supplied by groundwater sources with fluoride addition .
