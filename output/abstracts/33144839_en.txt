To understand the perception of quality of life, functionality, and psychological aspects of adults with lower limb sarcoma who underwent conservative surgery or amputation. Sociodemographic data were collected, and the following questionnaires were used: EORTC QLQ - C30 for quality of life, the Functional Assessment System (MSTS) for functionality and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) for depression symptoms. The sample consisted of 45 young adults with sarcoma, divided into two groups: amputation (29) and conservative surgery (16). Most were male, single and students. Average family income before and after the disease did not differ, but those that were employed had a better perception of general quality of life, as well as those with higher family income after the disease. Regarding the type of surgery, there was a predominance of amputation; osteosarcoma was the most common histological type and the most affected region was the femur. All participants participated in social, cultural, sporting or religious activities. MSTS and Beck scale values did not differ between procedures. Given the scarcity of studies on the subject at the national level, further investigations are suggested to explore aspects related to quality of life for patients with sarcomas. <b><i>Level of Evidence III, Retrospective comparative study.</i></b>
