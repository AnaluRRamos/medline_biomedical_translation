Sleep is a fundamental aspect for maintaining physical and emotional health, as well as one's well-being. Few studies have assessed the effect of socioeconomic conditions on sleep in the COVID-19 pandemic. Our objective was to analyze the increase or incidence of sleep disorders according to demographic and economic conditions, prior to the pandemic, and according to changes in financial, occupational, and household conditions during the pandemic. This study was conducted via web access, using data from April 24 to May 24, with 45,160 Brazilians (aged 18 or older), with a sample weighted by Brazilian National Household Sample Survey (PNAD) data. Change in sleep quality (outcome), monthly income, effect on family income, occupation/work, gender, age group, marital status, and change in domestic work (exposures) were reported. The percentages of onset or increase of sleep disorders and adjusted odds ratio were estimated. The chance of exacerbation of sleep disorders was 34%, 71%, and twice as high in people with income less than one minimum wage before the pandemic, in those who lost their job and in those who had a great decrease in their income/were without income, respectively. The chance of worsening sleep disorders was 82% higher in women; three times higher (OR = 3.14) in the population aged from 18 to 29, compared to the older adults; and higher with the increase in the amount of housework (OR = 2.21). Financial and occupational factors were determinants in the worsening of self-reported sleep quality, requiring rapid actions on these conditions in order to minimize this effect. Gender, age group, and household routines also deserve attention regarding sleep quality.
