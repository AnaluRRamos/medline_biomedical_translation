Syphilis is nowadays a rare cause of aortic aneurysms in developed countries. Commonly saccular, syphilitic aneurysms are frequently single, involving the ascending aorta and arch and are frequently asymptomatic unless large enough to cause symptoms due to compression of surrounding structures or death from rupture. In this paper, the authors present the case of a 32-years old patient presenting with progressive weakness, anorexia, weight loss and hoarseness, who was diagnosed with a multiple saccular aortic aneurysms, which were syphilitic in nature. The patient underwent surgery for a hemiarch replacement after receiving a cycle of antibiotics and had an uneventful recovery. This case illustrates that, although rare, syphilis must be recognized as a potential source of aneurismal disease as it warrants antibiotic therapy and screening of involvement of other organs.
