The study aimed to verify the adequacy of funds for food purchases from family farming in the scope of the National School Food Program (PNAE) in Brazil's state capitals and the Federal District. This was a descriptive study based on secondary data obtained from the webpage of the National Fund for the Development of Education (FNDE) in the link dedicated to information on family farming. We analyzed the amounts transferred to the FNDE and the percentage used in purchasing foods from family farmers for school meals in the state capitals and Federal District from 2011 to 2017. Data were collected in May 2019. One-third of the 27 cities (33.3%) reported purchases above the minimum recommended level (30%). The North of Brazil complied with the recommended level (39.4%), while the Southeast reported the lowest level (6.4%). There was an increase from 2011 to 2017 in the total amounts invested and in the number of cities that purchased foods from family farming. Boa Vista (Roraima) was the capital that spent the largest share of its school meal funds on foods produced by family farmers (56.6%). In 2017, the local governments in Boa Vista and Aracaju (Sergipe) offered matching funds for the funds transferred from the FNDE for these food purchases. In conclusion, from 2011 to 2017, only one-third of the capital cities adequately used the percentage of funds for purchasing foods from family farming, although there was a gradual increase in the purchase of these foods, especially in the state capitals from North and Northeast Brazil.
