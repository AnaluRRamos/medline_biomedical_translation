To analyze the safety culture related to the communication dimensions and event notification from the perception of the health team. Survey carried out in a teaching hospital of Paraná through the application of the Survey on Patient Safety Culture questionnaire to 158 professionals working in surgical units from May to September 2017.The analysis of the data was done by descriptive and analytical statistics; dimensions with positive responses ≥75% represent strong areas for patient safety. No dimension or item/question were considered strong to surgical patient safety. There was a difference, with a less negative perception from nursing in relation to medicine, in the dimensions 'Return of the information and communication about the error' and 'Frequency of events reports' (p<0.001). The health team perceives that there is fragility in the patient safety in relation to the communication dimension, demanding actions that promote the patient safety.
