Deaths from malformations of the circulatory system (MCS) have a major impact on mortality reduction. given that most cases are avoidable with correct diagnosis and treatment. To describe the distribution of mortality from MCS by sex. age. and macroregion in Brazil. in individuals under the age of 20. between 2000 and 2015. A descriptive study of mortality rates and proportional mortality (PM) from MCS. other congenital malformations (OCM). circulatory system disease (CSD). ill-defined causes (IDC). and external causes (EC) in Brazil. There were 1.367.355 deaths from all causes in individuals younger than 20. 55.0% under 1 year of age. A total of 144.057 deaths were caused by congenital malformations. 39% of them by MCS. In both sexes. the annual mortality from MCS was 5.3/100.000. PM from MCS was 4.2%. CSD 2.2%. IDC 6.2% and EC 24.9%. Unspecified MCS showed the highest PM rates in both sexes and age groups. especially in the north and northeast regions (60%). Deaths from malformations occurred 5.7 times more frequently during the first year of life than in other ages (MCS: 5.0; OCM: 6.4). MCS was the leading cause of death among all malformations. being twice as important as CSD. mainly under 1 year of age. The frequency of misdiagnosis of MCS as cause of death was high in all ages and both sexes. especially in the north and northeast regions. These findings highlight the need for the development of public health strategies focused on correct diagnosis and early treatment of congenital cardiopathies. leading to a reduction in mortality.
