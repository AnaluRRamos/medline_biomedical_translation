Systemic arterial hypertension manifests as constant elevation of blood pressure and is considered to be an important cardiovascular risk factor. Systemic evaluation of cardiovascular diseases in patients with systemic arterial hypertension is imperative for prevention. The objective of the present study was to investigate and inter-relate sex and age with systemic arterial hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. Medical records of patients with systemic arterial hypertension and cardiovascular disease were evaluated. Data from the medical records were recorded in a prescribed protocol and the data were analyzed and correlated to the patients' age and sex. A total of 170 medical records for patients who visited the cardiology department were reviewed. Of these, 50 patients had systemic arterial hypertension and 19 of this subset had cardiovascular diseases. When we correlated systemic arterial hypertension with age, we observed that patients in the 51-60 years age group were more prone to systemic arterial hypertension (36%). Most of the patients with both systemic arterial hypertension and cardiovascular disease were female and in the 61-70 years age group, while among males the highest rate of occurrence was seen in the 51-60 years age group. The correlation coefficient (r) was 0.62, indicating a moderate, positive, linear relationship between systemic arterial hypertension and cardiovascular disease. A majority of patients with systemic arterial hypertension may develop cardiovascular disease and, as age increases, the tendency to develop hypertension also increases.
