The paper examines the evaluation of scientific productivity. It analyzes the metrification of the evaluation of scientific production, as well as the historical construction, and current uses of scientific evaluation. It argues that this process contains a paradox: the more that metrics become impersonal, the less they are recognized by scientists. The study is divided into five sections: contextualization of the problematics of scientific evaluation; a description of the main stages in the institutionalization of metrification; an overview of the development of the main evaluation indexes; some examples of the application of these indexes; and analytical consequences and recommendations for the formulation of a new evaluation agenda.
