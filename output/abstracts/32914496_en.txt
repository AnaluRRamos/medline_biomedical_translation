Canine perianal fistula (CPF) is a severe, painful, debilitating skin condition affecting the perianal skin. It often interferes with the quality of life of both dog and owner. Conventional medical treatment involves the use of immunosuppressive therapy; however, the successful resolution of lesions can be limited by poor owner compliance, adverse drug effects and dependence on costly therapies. The present study aimed to assess the potential benefits of fluorescent light energy (FLE) on cases of CPF. Four dogs with active perianal fistulas METHODS AND MATERIALS: FLE was applied as sole management therapy once a week with two consecutive applications in the same session for each dog until clinical signs had significantly improved, with weekly assessments for a six week period. Dogs were assessed by measuring the size of lesions at the start of the study and then weekly for six weeks, using planimetry software. Owners recorded vocalization and straining frequency scores during their pet's defaecation, and perianal licking frequency on a 0-5 point scale to assess the response to therapy. All dogs improved with FLE, achieving a significant reduction in vocalization, straining and licking after two weeks (P = 0.002). After five weeks of FLE therapy, lesional areas had significantly decreased (P = 0.04). Only one dog required more than seven applications. No adverse events were reported. FLE may be a promising alternative therapy for CPF.
