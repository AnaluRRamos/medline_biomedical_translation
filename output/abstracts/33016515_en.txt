The efficacy of afoxolaner was evaluated in two captive Burmese python snakes, which were naturally infested with Ophionyssus natricis mites. The administration of a single oral dose of afoxolaner eliminated live O.Â natricis mites from both snakes by Day 3. Environmental samples collected from the snakes' terrariums were negative for dead mites by Day 30.
