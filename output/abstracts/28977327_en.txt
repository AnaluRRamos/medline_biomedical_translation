EEC is an acronym for an autosomal dominant syndrome clinically characterized by ectrodactyly (E), ectodermal dysplasia (E) and cleft lip/palate (C). Our aim was to describe a rare case of siblings affected by ectrodactyly, ectodermal dysplasia and cleft lip/palate (EEC) syndrome presenting normal parents. The patient was the third son of young and healthy parents. The parents did not present any minor or major anomaly of hands, feet or skin, hair and teeth. The couple had a previous history of two children with hands and feet malformations similar to the present patient. The first was a stillborn, and the second one a preterm infant that died in the first days after birth due to the consequences of prematurity. After birth, the patient presented respiratory distress with need of endotracheal intubation and mechanic ventilation. At physical examination, there were cleft lip/palate, hands and feet ectrodactyly, with absence of the second and third fingers in both hands, and reduction defects affecting mainly the second toes. The child presented pneumothorax and cardiorespiratory arrest and died at 1 month and 26 days. Herein we described a case of siblings with EEC syndrome, indicative of a germline mosaicism. In the literature review, there was the description of only three similar reports. The present case strengthens the possibility that germline mosaicism may be a more common inheritance mechanism than previously thought in cases of EEC syndrome.
