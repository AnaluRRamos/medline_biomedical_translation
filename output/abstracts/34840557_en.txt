To determine the prevalence of maternal death, stillbirth and low birthweight in women with (pre-)eclampsia and complicated pregnancies or deliveries in Centre de Références des Urgences Obstétricales, an obstetric emergency hospital in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and to identify the main risk factors for these adverse pregnancy outcomes. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of pregnant women admitted to Centre de Référence des Urgences Obstétricales between 2013 and 2018 using hospital records. Risk factors investigated were age group, type of pregnancy (singleton, multiple), type of delivery and use of antenatal care services. A total of 31 509 women and 24 983 deliveries were included in the analysis. Among these, 204 (0.6%) maternal deaths (648 per 100 000 women giving birth), 1962 (7.9%) stillbirths and 11 008 (44.1%) low birthweight neonates were identified. Of all admissions, 10 991 (34.9%) were women with (pre-)eclampsia. Caesarean section significantly increased the risk of maternal death in the women with a complicated pregnancy and women with (pre-)eclampsia, but reduced the risk of stillbirth in such women. Not attending antenatal care was associated with a significantly higher risk of stillbirth (odds ratio (OR) 4.82; 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.55-6.55) and low birthweight (OR 1.40; 95% CI 1.05-1.86) for women with complicated pregnancies. To prevent and treat pregnancy complications as early as possible, antenatal care attendance is crucial. Improving the quality of and access to antenatal care services and providing it free to all pregnant women in Haiti is recommended.
