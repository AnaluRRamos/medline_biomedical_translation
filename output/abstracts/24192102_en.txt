Secondary immunodeficiences are associated with an increased incidence of infection and malignancy, as well with development of autoimmune disease. Immune system function is altered by many conditions, such as aging, malnutrition and mycobacterial infections. However, the treatment of the primary condition often results in the improvement of the immune compromise. The authors present a case of cytomegalovirus encephalitis and hepatitis, due to viral reactivation associated with development of secondary immunodeficience in an HIV-negative patient.
