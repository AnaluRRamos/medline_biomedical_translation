The simultaneous occurrence of specific diseases in older adults is explored little in the literature. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of concomitant hypertension and diabetes in Brazilian older adults and determine associated contextual and individual factors. A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted with 10,991 older adults (â‰¥ 60 years of age) interviewed during the 2012 Vigitel Survey. Statistical analysis involved multi-level Poisson regression. Mean age was 69.4. The prevalence of the concomitant occurrence of hypertension and diabetes was 16.2%, with differences found among the capital cities. Higher prevalence rates were found in cities located in the southern, southeastern and central-western regions of the country as well as among black and brown older adults, those with up to eight years of schooling, non-smokers, ex-smokers and those with excess weight. The effect of geographic region was demonstrated by the 23.5% increase in the prevalence of the concomitant diseases after adjusting for individual variables. The present findings enabled gauging the effect of context (region of residence) on the prevalence of the main diseases related to an increased mortality rate in the older population.
