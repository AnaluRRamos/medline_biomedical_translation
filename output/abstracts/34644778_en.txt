To evaluate the completeness and concordance of infant deaths from congenital syphilis in the Metropolitan Region of Sao Paulo, Brazil, between 2010 and 2017. This was a descriptive study based on linkage between the Mortality Information System (SIM) and the Live Birth Information System (SINASC). Deaths with mention of congenital syphilis in multiple causes of death were analyzed. The completeness of 11 SIM variables was analyzed and SINASC was adopted as the reference. The Kappa statistic was used to analyze concordance. There were 134 recorded congenital syphilis deaths, 132 of which were linked. 67 had congenital syphilis as the underlying cause, while 65 involved multiple causes of death, indicating underestimated congenital syphilis mortality. After linkage, the number of variables with excellent completeness increased from two to ten. Linking SIM with SINASC data improved completeness. The magnitude of congenital syphilis mortality was found to be underestimated, and the use of multiple causes improved its measurement.
