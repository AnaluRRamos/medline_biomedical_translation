In paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), pulmonary vein isolation using cryoballoon (CB-PVI) has similar efficacy as radiofrequency ablation (RF-PVI) has. In redo ablation procedures following RF-PVI, PV reconnection is high, whereas in patients with redo following CB-PVI, information is scarce. To determine the sites of PV reconnection in patients who underwent redo ablation after initial CB-PVI. Patients who underwent an AF redo procedure, following an initial CB-PVI for PAF were included. LA electroanatomic mapping was used. A reconnection site was defined as the presence of a voltage of 0.3mV or greater in the PV and unidirectional or bidirectional conduction in the PV during sinus rhythm. Reconnections sites were identified using a clock-face view description and were ablated with radiofrequency afterwards. Out of the 165 patients who underwent initial PVI, 27 required redo ablations, of which 18 (66.6%) were males, with a mean age of 55+12.3 years. The time of recurrence was 8.9+6.4 months. PV reconnection was found in 21 (77.8%) patients. There was a total of 132 conduction gaps, six per patient, 3.6 per PV. A significant number of gaps were in the anterosuperior region of the left superior PV (LSPV), and in the septal and inferior regions of the right superior PV (RSPV). The upper PVs had the most reconnection sites, mostly at the anterior region of the LSPV and the septal region of the RSPV. The reason behind this may be due to greater atrial wall thickness, and difficulty in achieving adequate cryoballoon contact.
