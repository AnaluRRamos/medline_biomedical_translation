Brugada Syndrome is an inherited arrhythmogenic disorder characterized by the presence of specific electrocardiographic features with or without clinical symptoms. The patients present increased risk of sudden death due to ventricular fibrillation. The prevalence of this electrocardiographic pattern differs according to the studied region. However, epidemiological information including the Brazilian population is scarce. To assess the prevalence of the electrocardiographic pattern of Brugada syndrome and the epidemiological profile associated with it. Cross-sectional study that included 846,533 ECG records of 716,973 patients from the electrocardiogram (ECG) database from the Santa Catarina Telemedicine Network over a 4-year period. All tests were 12-lead conventional ECG (without V1 and V2 in high positions). The tests revealing “Brugada Syndrome” diagnosis (Types 1 and 2) were reviewed by a cardiac electrophysiologist. The level of significance was set at p<0.05. In total, 83 patients had a pattern potentially consistent with Brugada-type pattern ECG. Of these, 33 were confirmed having Brugada-type 1, and 22 with type 2 ECG after reevaluation. The prevalence of Brugada-type 1 ECG was 4.6 per 100,000 patients. Brugada-type 1 ECG was associated with the male gender (81.8% vs. 41.5%, p<0.001) and a lower prevalence of obesity diagnosis (9.1% vs. 26.4%, p=0.028). This study showed low prevalence of Brugada-type ECG in Southern Brazil. The presence of Brugada-type 1 ECG was associated with the male gender and lower prevalence of obesity diagnosis comparing to the general population.
