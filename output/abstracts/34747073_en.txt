Horner's syndrome (HS) occurs when the sympathetic nerve pathway is disrupted. This case report describes a cat with acromelanism that developed unilateral facial hypopigmentation concurrently with HS after an oesophagostomy tube was placed. Both the hypopigmentation and HS resolved completely following removal of the oesophagostomy tube.
