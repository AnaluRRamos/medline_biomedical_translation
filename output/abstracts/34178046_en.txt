We report a case of inferior vena cava filter perforation immediately after filter implantation, recognized intraoperatively in a patient undergoing laparotomy for resection of locally advanced ovarian cancer. We describe an alternative approach with strut resection, less invasive than filter removal, enabling the device to be maintained and bleeding to be controlled.
