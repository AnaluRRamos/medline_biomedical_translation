In this article we present a rare variant in which the large intestine was vascularized by the inferior mesenteric artery. It was encountered during macro and microscopic dissection of the cadaver of a 63-year-old woman at a university department of human anatomy. In this case, the ascending, transverse, descending, and sigmoid colon and rectum were vascularized by the inferior mesenteric artery, whereas the small intestine, cecum and appendix were supplied by the superior mesenteric artery.
