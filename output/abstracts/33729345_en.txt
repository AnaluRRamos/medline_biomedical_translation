There are no nationwide studies characterizing accessibility for people with disabilities during delivery. This study aimed to describe the physical structure of hospital units regarding accessibility for pregnant and puerperae with motor (MD), visual (VD), or hearing (HD) disabilities in Brazil. This is an ecological, descriptive study conducted in all 606 health facilities linked to the 'Rede Cegonha' where deliveries occurred, according to 2015 databases. We performed the descriptive and geospatial analysis and considered the presence of motor accessibility when the establishment had a handrail or elevator ramp, wheelchair-sized doors, and accessible bathroom with bars. We assumed visual accessibility when there was tactile signage on the floor (Braille system or embossed figures) and hearing accessibility when there was signage by texts, pictures, signs, posters, or symbols in the environments. In Brazil, only 26 (4.3%) of the facilities had accessibility for people with MD, 20 (3.3%) for people with VD, and none for HD. Motor accessibility was worse in the North and Northeast of Brazil, and hearing accessibility in the North region. Despite advances in the implementation of the 'Rede Cegonha' in Brazil, the facilities' structure is not adapted for women with MD, VD, or HD.
