This study aimed to analyze mortality during heat waves in the city of Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 2005-2015. We used a time series design with generalized additive models, linking mortality to days of heat waves throughout the period, and to days of the heat wave in 2013, the longest wave since 1906, controlling for time variables, mean temperature, and humidity. Risk of death from natural causes increased by 14% (RR = 1.140; 95%CI: 1.108-1.173) during heat waves when compared to the other days in the hot season. The increase occurred in both sexes and in all age groups, and individuals under 15 years of age were more affected (RR = 1.167; 95%CI: 1.019-1.335) as were those over 84 years (RR = 1.201; 95%CI: 1.098-1.313). The heat wave in December 2013 showed an increase of 43% (RR = 1.428; 95%CI: 1.399-1.457) in total daily deaths, increasing to 51% in individuals over 84 years (RR = 1.515; 95%CI: 1.372-1.674) and 65% (RR = 1.647; 95%CI: 1.367-1.986) for renal causes. We conclude that heat waves pose a significant risk of death, differing according to sex and age in the population of Buenos Aires.
