The article analyzes the application of four criteria for the (re)distribution of basic health teamwork at the local level. This was a descriptive, cross-sectional, case study conducted in Nueva Esparta, Venezuela, in 2016. An instrument was designed to consolidate in a single database the local data on basic health teamwork in 170 popular clinics serving 447 communities. The target criteria were: (1) basic health teamwork/population ratio, calculating the number of complete and incomplete basic health teamwork and the density of health professionals per 10,000 inhabitants; (2) distance between the popular clinics and the population; (3) characteristics of the health professionals comprising the basic health teamwork, by sex, age, and health profession; (4) analysis of the metrics for inequality as an innovative criterion, calculating two summary measures of gap and one health inequality gradient to assess the proposals for (re)distribution of the basic health teamwork. There were differences within states at the municipal and local community levels in the distribution of health professionals and a shortage of nurses and health promoters. Of the 317 required basic health teamwork, there were 52 complete basic health teamwork. The measures of inequality reflect an eco-social equidistribution of human resources, favoring the poorer populations. Combined application of the criteria allowed identifying geographic areas and populations with the greatest need and shortage of basic health teamwork and optimizing their equitable (re)distribution at the local level. The limitation of lack of disaggregated information was overcome by using a single data repository with consensual information among the state and local health teamwork. In conclusion, investments should be made in efficient information systems.
