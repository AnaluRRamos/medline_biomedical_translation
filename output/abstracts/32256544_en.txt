To determine the associations between sociodemographic characteristics and the current prevalence of tobacco use in Costa Rica, based on the results of the Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS). Cross-sectional observational epidemiological study, country-wide (n = 8607), that used the sociodemographic variables included in GATS 2015. A logistic regression model was designed to predict the impact of those variables on current tobacco use. The dependent variable is current tobacco use, considering the social determinants available in the survey: sex, educational level, area of residence, age, and household composition. The logistic regression model shows that being female (OR = 0.29; <i>P</i> < 0.01), being 65 years old and over (OR = 0.61; <i>P</i> = 0.02), living in a rural area (OR = 0.63; <i>P</i> < 0.01), and living with other people (OR = 0.68; <i>P</i> < 0.01), in particular with children 15 years old or under (OR = 0.55; <i>P</i> < 0.01), are protective factors against tobacco use. Tobacco use declines significantly with increased wealth, as measured by household items, in women but not in men. Completing secondary education is a protective factor in people 15-34 years old (OR = 0.47; <i>P</i> < 0.01) but not in people 35 and over . There is an association between the sociodemographic variables found in the GATS Costa Rica survey carried out in 2015 and current tobacco use. Interventions at the family and community levels could help consumers give up smoking.
