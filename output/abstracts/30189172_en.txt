Parona Space infection is a rare forearm condition. We present a case of a 55-year-old male with pain and loss of function in the distal forearm for one week, with no previous history of trauma. Additionally, he presented a history of odontogenic infection, synchronous with the onset of the symptoms in the forearm, with spontaneous resolution. The wrist ultrasound found an abscess in the Parona space that was surgically drained. The bacterial culture test was positive for Streptococcus constellatus. Oral evaluation revealed symptomatic exacerbation in the upper left second molar of chronic periodontitis. Oral septic foci were eliminated and the patient had full recovery. Dental history, the bacteria isolated and the absence of trauma confirm the dental origin of the abscess. As far as the authors are aware, this is the first published case of an odontogenic forearm abscess. This case highlights the importance of systematic elimination of oral septic foci in the population.
