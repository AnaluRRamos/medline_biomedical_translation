Chondrosarcoma is a malignant cartilage-forming neoplasm. It is difficult to treat because of resistance to both chemotherapy and radiation, making wide local excision the only treatment. This report presents an active, 43 year-old man who was diagnosed with recurrent clear cell chondrosarcoma of the proximal left femur, previously reconstructed with a total hip prosthesis, extending to the weight-bearing dome of the acetabulum. Cancer staging study revealed no signs of tumor dissemination at distance. Given the excellent functional status of the patient, the authors performed a Enneking-Dunham type periacetabular pelvic resection and resected en bloc, with the total hip prosthesis including 22Â cm of the femur and a portion of the hip abductor apparatus. Acetabular reconstruction was performed with a non-cemented pedestal cup prosthesis fixed at the iliac, and in-femur reconstruction utilized a cemented silver-coated proximal femur modular prosthesis. Today, after a 10-year follow-up, the patient is walking without crutches, he practices recreational cycling without assistance, and he is asymptomatic and free of tumoral disease. At present, no signs of relevant loosening, instability, infection, heterotopic ossification, or any other complications have been observed. Pelvic reconstructions are challenging and risky surgeries; however, the appearance of more functional implants, like the pedestal cup prosthesis, and its correct application and indication, may allow promising clinical and functional results with low complications rate.
