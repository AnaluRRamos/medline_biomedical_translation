Canine granulomatous mural folliculitis is a very rare cause of scarring alopecia with unknown pathogenesis. To report a case of granulomatous mural folliculitis in a dog treated with ciclosporin (Cs) and methotrexate (MTX). A 13-year-old spayed female Pyrenean shepherd dog with a one month history of scarring alopecia. Histopathological examination revealed a granulomatous and lymphocytic mural and necrotizing folliculitis and furunculosis. Immunochemistry, using antibodies for CD3, CD204, CD206, IBA-1 and CD208, revealed that CD3<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes were infiltrating the outer root sheath along with IBA-1<sup>+</sup> or CD204<sup>+</sup> cells. Ciclosporin (5 mg/kg once daily) and MTX (0.25 mg/kg once weekly then 0.5 mg/kg once weekly) were initiated simultaneously, and Cs was stopped after stabilization of the lesions. The dog's skin disease was stable for six months. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of the long-term management of a granulomatous mural folliculitis in a dog. Ciclosporin and MTX appeared to be an effective treatment option. Additional treated cases are needed to assess the effectiveness of MTX in canine immune-mediated diseases.
