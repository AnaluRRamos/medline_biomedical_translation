The European poultry red mite (PRM) Dermanyssus gallinae, a common ectoparasite of laying chickens and pigeons; it also can feed on other birds, humans and domestic animals, causing clinical signs ranging from mild discomfort to severe dermatitis. Little is known about possible hypersensitivity to PRM or cross-sensitization with house dust or storage mites. Knowledge on possible PRM immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergy and possible cross-sensitization with house dust and storage mites may facilitate the clinical approach. The aim herein was to clarify possible evidence of type I hypersensitivity to PRM in dogs and possible occurrence of cross-sensitization with house dust and storage mites. Sixteen dogs with chronic contact with PRM-infested chickens from traditional bird houses and 10 control dogs with no contact with birds. Dogs were subjected to intradermal testing (IDT) and serum specific IgE (sIgE) determination for house dust and storage mites and D. gallinae. The highest wheal score was obtained with 0.1 mg/mL D. gallinae extract. Positive IDT reactions to PRM were found in four of 10 control dogs and in 10 of 16 from the chicken-exposed group. SIgE to PRM was detected in one control and in seven dogs exposed to chickens. No significant correlation was found between IDT or sIgE scores to PRM and house dust and storage mites. Contact with PRM-infested chickens may lead to sensitization without allergy, independently from sensitization to house dust and storage mites.
