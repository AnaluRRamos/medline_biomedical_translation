This study evaluated the prevalence and factors associated with lack of enrollment for kidney transplant among patients in chronic dialysis in Greater Metropolitan Fortaleza, Cear√°, Brazil. The sample excluded patients with insufficient clinical status and those already in pre-kidney transplant evaluation. A semi-structured questionnaire was applied, including options for the question, 'What is the main reason why you are not enrolled for kidney transplant?' Prevalence of patients considered fit but not enrolled or in pre- kidney transplant evaluation was 50.7%. The main reasons were fear of failure/loss of grafting (32.5%), difficulty with transportation or access to tests (20.9%), and temporary personal or family problems (13.7%). In the multivariate analysis, the variables associated with fear of failure or loss of graft were female sex (OR = 1.763; 95%CI: 1.224-2.540) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) due to hypertension (OR = 1.732; 95%CI: 1.178-2.547), while monthly income (number of minimum wages) showed a protective association (OR = 0.882; 95%CI: 0.785-0.991). Time on dialysis (months) was a risk factor for difficulty with transportation and access to tests (OR = 1.004; 95%CI: 1.001-1.007), and female sex showed a protective association (OR = 0.576; 95%CI: 0.368-0.901). These results show high prevalence of patients in dialysis not enrolled on the kidney transplant waitlist. The main causes were lack of information and lack of access. Female sex, low income, and ESRD due to hypertension were risk factors for lack of enrollment on the kidney transplant waitlist due to fear of loss of graft, resulting from lack of information on this treatment modality. Male sex and longer time on dialysis were risk factors for difficulty in access to kidney transplant.
