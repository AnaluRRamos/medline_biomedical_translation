This article presents an integral approach to work in community projects, based on Guattari's three ecologies and its dialogue with psychosocial theorists, since it involves the need to combine technological interventions with social approaches. These contributions are explored to point out the need for dialogue in the implementation of sanitation actions, mainly in the rural area and in traditional communities, involving the individual, the groups served and their territorial culture. The approach presented was implemented in a joint action with the Cai√ßara Community of Praia do Sono and the Forum of Traditional Communities of Angra dos Reis, Paraty and Ubatuba (FCT), based on the Observatory of Sustainable and Healthy Territories of Bocaina (OTSS / Fiocruz). It could be verified that the inclusion of the actors in the social mobilization for the sanitation can entail an effective social participation that generates both a subjective change in the conscience of the diverse local actors and structural gains that promote health and quality of life. The panorama covered shows the importance of a global understanding of the problem, but also, of a simultaneous local, territorialized action, adapted to each reality through genuine dialogue and horizontal participation.
