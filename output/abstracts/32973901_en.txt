Measure social inequalities in antimicrobial resistance in <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i> in Colombia. Ecological study using a multi-panel of data, disaggregated at the subnational level, and using isolations of <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i> as a proxy for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) between 2009 and 2018. A sociodemographic characterization, an analysis of the antimicrobial sensitivity of isolations of <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i>, and a measurement of inequalities in AMR in <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i> were conducted using the slope index of inequality, the relative inequality index, and the concentration index. The findings indicate antimicrobial resistance to penicillin (50.7%) and tetracycline (67.3%) in isolations of <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i>, and the existence of absolute and relative inequalities during the study period. Access barriers to health services, not having received information on the prevention of sexually transmitted infections, basic unmet needs, and illiteracy explained the inequalities in AMR in <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i>. Six recommendations emerged with a view to largely containing AMR in <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i>: i) increase awareness of safe sexual and reproductive health; ii) rethink how to deliver key messages with an equity approach; iii) improve information, prescription, and drug chain systems; iv) form coalitions to improve response and share objectives with the private sector; v) improve the availability and disaggregation of data; and vi) support research on inequalities in AMR.
