There is a global shortage of individuals for jobs that require special skills and techniques, such as butchers. As a result, the available workers are overloaded, which might impair their quality of life. To assess the quality of life of butchers working for a network of butcher shops in Sao Paulo. Cross-sectional observational study with a selected group of butchers and a control group, with age ranging from 18 to 45 years old and from both genders. A quality of life questionnaire (World Health Organization Quality of Life, bref - WHOQOL-bref) was applied to a sample of 50 butchers and 50 controls. The scores for butchers were statistically significantly lower in all quality of life variables, except for self-assessment compared to the controls (p<0.05) even after adjustment for characteristics differing between the groups. The present study provides data poorly investigated in other studies, and suggests that assessment of the perception of the quality of life of butchers should continue.
