The aim of this study was to disentangle mechanisms of epileptogenesis in monogenic epilepsies in children. We reviewed paediatric monogenic epilepsies excluding brain malformation or an inborn error of metabolism, but including the gene function whether there is loss-of-function or gain-of-function, age at gene expression when available, and associated epilepsy syndrome. Genes for which at least five patients with similar epilepsy phenotype had been reported were selected. Three mechanisms are shared by most monogenic epilepsies: (1) excess of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) transmission activation (NMDA-pathies); (2)Â abnormal gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transmission with reduced inhibition (phasic GABA-pathies); and (3) tonic activation of extrasynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors by extracellular GABA (tonic GABA-pathies). NMDA-pathies comprise early epileptic encephalopathy with suppression-burst, neonatal/infantile benign seizures, West and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes, and encephalopathy with continuous spike waves in slow sleep, thus brief seizures with major interictal spiking. Phasic GABA-pathies comprise mostly generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus and Dravet syndrome, thus long-lasting seizures with mild interictal spiking. Tonic GABA-pathies cause epilepsy with myoclonic-atonic seizures and Angelman syndrome, thus major high-amplitude slow-wave activity. This pathophysiological approach to monogenic epilepsies provides diagnostic clues and helps to guide treatment strategy. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: In paediatric monogenic epilepsies, electroclinical patterns point to three main mechanisms: NMDA-pathies, and phasic and tonic GABA-pathies. Antiepileptic treatment choice could be guided by each of these mechanisms.
