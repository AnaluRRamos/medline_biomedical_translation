To verify the prevalence of poor sleep quality and its association with personal characteristics and symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress in amateur adolescent athletes. 309 adolescent athletes aged between 10 and 19 years were enrolled. Data collection included: a structured questionnaire, with personal information; the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI); and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Results are described in mean and standard deviation (numeric variables) and absolute and relative frequencies (categorical variables). For the inferential analysis, Student's t-test and chi-square test were performed, in addition to Poisson regression. Prevalence ratios (PR) were calculated in a 95% confidence interval (95%CI). The mean age of participants was 14.1±2.1, being 13.8±2.0 and 15.0±2.1, respectively, for those with good and poor sleep quality. Poor sleep quality was recorded in 28.2% (n=87), depression in 26.9% (n=83) and anxiety/stress in 40.1% (n=124). Poor sleep quality was associated with ages between 15 and 19 years (PR 1.24; 95%CI 1.14-1.37), overweight (PR 1.12; 95%CI 1.01-1.24) and psychological symptoms of depression (PR 1.23; 95%CI 1.08-1.40) and anxiety/stress (PR 1.16; 95%CI 1.04-1.28). The presence of overweight and psychological symptoms and the age over 15 years were risk factors for increasing the likelihood of poor sleep quality in adolescent athletes.
