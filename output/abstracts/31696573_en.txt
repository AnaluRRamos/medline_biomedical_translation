Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a cytokine involved primarily in angiogenesis. In human atopic dermatitis (AD), VEGF has been detected in the stratum corneum and blood. To evaluate VEGF-A expression in the serum and stratum corneum of healthy and atopic dogs, and its possible correlation with disease severity in atopic dogs. Fifteen atopic and 15 healthy, privately owned dogs. The severity of clinical signs associated with AD was evaluated with the Canine Atopic Dermatitis Extent and Severity Index (CADESI-04). For all dogs, a single blood sample was performed and serum collected. Tape stripping (15 times) was performed on the left periocular area (lesional skin). A commercially available canine-specific VEGF-A enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed with all samples. Vascular endothelial growth factor-A was undetectable in the serum. In the stratum corneum, there was no significant difference in VEGF-A concentrations between healthy (mean 89.4 ± 59.5 pg/ml) and atopic dogs (mean 100.3 ± 77.1pg/ml) (P = 0.71). There was no correlation between stratum corneum VEGF-A concentrations and CADESI-04 scores. The role of VEGF in canine AD is unclear. Because of many variants, VEGF-C and VEGF-D or VEGF-A isotopes should be explored in the skin to better evaluate the role of VEGF in canine atopy. Full-thickness skin biopsy, molecular biology and histopathological investigation may be necessary to further assess cutaneous VEGF expression.
