Investigate vocal fatigue and its relationship with the sensation of phonatory effort and discomfort in the vocal tract of teachers after a week of activity. Cross-sectional, quantitative study, involving 40 teachers with complaints of vocal fatigue. Procedures performed at the beginning and end of the week, before the classes start were Vocal Fatigue Index, Borg Scale, Vocal Tract Discomfort Scale, and voice recording for perceptual analysis. There were no changes in phonatory effort and in frequency and intensity of discomfort in vocal tract. In relation to the VFI, in the domains of fatigue and vocal limitation and physical discomfort associated with the voice, teachers started and ended the week with values compatible with dysphonia. In the vocal restriction domain, they started the week with values compatible with vocal healthy individuals and at the end of the week they had scores compatible with dysphonia. In recovery with vocal rest, the pre and post values were below the cut-off score, meaning less vocal recovery. The greater the sensation of vocal fatigue, the greater the perception of phonatory effort; more frequent is the sensation of tightness, dryness, sore, sensitive and irritated throat and more intense the sensations of discomfort in the vocal tract: tightness, dryness, itching, sensitive and irritated throat. Teachers perceive an increase in vocal fatigue, without changes in phonatory effort and vocal tract discomfort after one week of class. The greater the perception of vocal fatigue, the greater the sensation of effort and phonatory discomfort.
