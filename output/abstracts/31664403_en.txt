This study aimed to determine the preferences of community-dwelling older people about information disclosure regarding poor prognosis, the likely symptoms and problems, and the care options available in a situation of serious illness with less than a year to live; and to identify factors associated with a preference for information disclosure regarding poor prognosis. The Brazilian version of the Preferences and Priorities for End of Life Care (PRISMA) questionnaire was administered face-to-face to 400 older people, living in the city of Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil. The main results indicated that 74.0% preferred to be informed that they had limited time left, 89.3% wished to be informed about symptoms and problems, and 96.3% about available care options. The factors associated with preferences for information about poor prognosis were: gender (women: OR = 0.446, 95% CI: 0.269-0.738) and choosing the least preferred place to die (home of a relative or friend: OR = 2.423, 95% CI: 1.130-5.198. These results show that most older people want to be informed in an advanced illness situation with less than a year to live. Health care professionals need to be prepared to anticipate news about poor prognosis and the disease.
