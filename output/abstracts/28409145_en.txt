Knee ligament reconstructions are commonly performed orthopedic procedures. Graft fixation is generally performed with metallic or absorbable interference screws. In a recent study, only ten reports of screw migration were retrieved; of these, only one was not related to the anterior cruciate ligament, and the majority was related to the use of poly-l-lactic acid (PLLA) screws. Only one case retrieved in the literature reported screw migration in reconstructions of the posterolateral corner, and that was to the intra-articular region. In the present article, the authors report a case of extra-articular and transcutaneous migration of a poly-l/d-lactide (PDLLA) interference screw following popliteal tendon reconstruction. Besides being the first case of popliteal tendon migration with extra-articular screw migration, no reports of PDLLA screw migration were retrieved in the literature.
