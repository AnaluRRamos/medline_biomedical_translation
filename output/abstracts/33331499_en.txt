To evaluate the effects of felted foam in the treatment of diabetic foot plantar ulcer. Systematic review with meta-analysis. Research was conducted in Cochrane Library, PubMed, CINAHL, Science Direct, Web of Science, SCOPUS, IBECS and LILACS. Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool was employed to evaluate risk of bias. The meta-analyses were calculated in the program Review Manager, while Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation was used for evaluating evidence quality. Four clinical essays and two cohorts were included. Mean plantar pressure of individuals exposed to felt was reduced by 10.77 kilopascals (CI 95% -14.92, -6.62; p<0.001). Higher reduction of plantar pressure was observed to be associated with the use of felt. Development of new models of relief orthosis with felted foam for plantar pressure is recommended, along with more clinical research elucidating related outcomes.
