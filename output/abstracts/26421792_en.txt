Genitourinary tuberculosis is the third most common form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, comprising 4 - 17% of extrapulmonary forms. The authors describe the case of a patient with recurrent urinary tract infections, without isolation of an infectious agent and without symptomatic resolution, despite antibiotic treatment. Imaging exams showed left ureteral stenosis with moderate hydronephrosis. The attempt of retrograde catheterization was impossible so we opted for percutaneous nephrostomy to renal relief. Microbiological urine analysis colleted by that way was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. The patient started therapy with classical quadruple therapy and underwent nephrostomy for catheter placement. Despite therapeutic measures the patient required nephrectomy due to nonfunctioning kidney. Genitourinary tuberculosis is a diagnosis that should be considered in the presence of a persistent sterile pyuria.
