Type 2 diabetes is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the world. In Mexico it is the first cause of mortality, disability, and potential years of life lost due to premature death. The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) implemented the PREVENIMSS strategy. The aim of the current study was to estimate the program's effect on the mortality trend from type 2 diabetes, based on an interrupted time series analysis. At the beginning of the target period, the diabetes mortality rate was higher in IMSS beneficiaries than in the control population. After the program's implementation, there was a slight reduction in the mortality trend, while the control group showed an upward trend. Differences in the trends between the two groups suggest that they are not the exclusive result of institutional interventions. Living and work conditions could explain these differences.
