The study estimated the prevalence of serum lipid alterations among adolescents and investigated its association with excess weight and abdominal obesity. It involved a cross-sectional study with 525 adolescents from Piracicaba (SÃ£o Paulo state). Anthropometric (body mass index, waist circumference and waist-height ratio) and biochemical information were obtained (total cholesterol and fractions, triglycerides). The relationship between the anthropometric indicators and alterations in lipid profile was tested by logistic regression. The prevalence of dyslipidemia was in the order of 81%. An association was verified between high WHeR and serum lipid alterations in total cholesterol (OR = 2.00; CI 95% = 1.09-3.64) and triglycerides (OR = 4.48; CI 95% = 2.03-9.89) after adjustment for age and sex. No significant associations of alterations in lipid profile were found with excess weight and CC. The high prevalence of dyslipidemia and its association with abdominal obesity indicates that preventive measures should begin in childhood in order to reduce the occurrence of cardiovascular diseases.
