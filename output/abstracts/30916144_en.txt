Use of anxiolytic drugs is an option for treating psychological symptoms. However, even if their use is controlled, there are risks of dependence, intoxication and cognitive alterations. Uncontrolled use among workers worsens these problems. Identify the prevalence of anxiolytic use and to know the factors associated with consumption in military firefighters. Cross-sectional survey of 711 firefighters from Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil, was conducted through self-reporting. Multinomial logistic regression was used to investigate associations between sociodemographic characteristics, living, working and health conditions and anxiolytic consumption in a controlled or uncontrolled manner. Prevalence of anxiolytic use was 9.9%. For 7.5% of firefighters the consumption occurred without indication and/or specialized therapeutic control. Controlled use was only associated with symptoms compatible with Common Mental Disorder (OR = 23.6; 95%CI 6.54 - 85.11). Uncontrolled use was associated with length of service (OR = 2.57; 95%CI 1.03 - 6.40), smoking (OR = 3.22; 95%CI 1.50 - 6.91) and symptomatology compatible with Common Mental Disorder (OR = 4.02; 95%CI 2.17 - 7.45). The high prevalence of consumption indicates alert to occupational health programs.
