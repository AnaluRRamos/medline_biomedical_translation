In a context of disaster recurrence, naturalization or demotion of the concept to tragedy does not include all the dynamics and processes involved in affecting the communities and population groups most vulnerable to death and illness, such as the older adults. This paper aims to describe and analyze the socioeconomic, environmental, and health context of impact on older adults in four municipalities in the states of Santa Catarina and Rio de Janeiro. We carried out documentary research and open data survey of sociodemographic, environmental, economic, and health aspects of these locations and population groups. Also, descriptive, interrupted time series and documentary analyses were integrated. Among the results, collected documents and data point to the lack of preventive or mitigating actions for priority groups. Significant changes in hospital admissions for older adults were observed for some groups of causes. We conclude that institutional learning based on collective construction is required to corroborate the disruption of the disaster repetitive cycle.
