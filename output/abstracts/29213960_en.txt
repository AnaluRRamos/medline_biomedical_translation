Alois Alzheimer is best known for his description of a novel disease, subsequently named after him. However, his wide range of interests also included vascular brain diseases. He described Senile dementia, a highly heterogeneous condition, and was able not only to distinguish it from syphilitic brain disease, but also to discriminate two clinicopathological subtypes, that may be labeled a 'arteriosclerotic subtype', comparable to the present clinicopathological continuum of 'Vascular cognitive impairment', and another as a 'neurodegenerative subtype', characterized by primary [cortical] ganglion cell [nerve cells] degeneration, possibly foreshadowing a peculiar presenile disease that he was to describe some years later and would carry his name. He also considered the possibility of a senile presentation of this disease subtype, which was described by Oskar Fischer a short time later. Considering the clinicopathological overlapping features of the 'arteriosclerotic subtype' of Senile dementia with Arteriosclerotic atrophy of the brain, it might be possible to consider that both represent a single condition.
