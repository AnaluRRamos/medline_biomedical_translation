To perform a retrospective epidemiological study of radiographs in order to evaluate the relationship between the anatomy of the scapula and the development of rotator cuff injuries (RCIs). This study retrospectively evaluated the relation of the critical shoulder angle (CSA) and RCIs from January 2011 to November 2013; patients were examined in the Orthopedics and Traumatology Department of a university hospital. The CSA was measured by radiographic standardization of two groups: a control group of 34 asymptomatic shoulders and a study group of 44 shoulders with complete RCIs. The mean age in the control group was 59.97 years (45-84) and the mean age in the group with RCIs was 59.75 years (45-84). Regarding the CSA, the control group had a mean angle of 33.59° (±3.37) and the group with RCIs had a mean angle of 39.75° (±5.35; <i>p</i> < 0.007). There is an association between CSA and RCIs.
