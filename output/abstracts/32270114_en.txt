The temperature of climate controlled areas in the food industry varies from -35°C to 12°C to ensure the quality of food. However, this temperature range might be harmful to the health of workers. To analyze parameters related to occupational exposure to cold risks to calculate clothing insulation indices and establish the efficacy of personal protective equipment (PPE). In stage 1 we analyzed environmental variables (air temperature and velocity and relative humidity) and the metabolic rate; in stage 2 we calculated the resultant clothing insulation index; in stage 3 we calculated the basic clothing insulation required to maintain the thermal balance and investigated the efficacy of PPE. While the air temperature was lower for activities developed in the freezing tunnel (secondary packaging department), required basic clothing insulation was higher for activities involving operating forklifts. Protection was efficacious for 83.3% of the analyzed activities, however, occurrence of thermal discomfort cannot be ruled out as a function of excessive clothing. Although protection was insufficient for 16.7% of the analyzed activities, breaks for thermal recovery neutralized the risk of hypothermia.
