A retrospective review aims to investigate the operative methods and therapeutic effects of the modified Stoppa approach for treating pelvic and acetabular fractures. 18 patients with acetabular fracture of the anterior column and pelvic anterior ring fracture underwent surgical treatment using the modified Stoppa approach. Some of the treatment was combined with the iliac fossa approach or rear K-L approach. Fracture reduction and postoperative function were evaluated using the Matta scoring standard and the Majeed scoring system. The Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine system was used to grade the literature review and create graded B recommendations. Incision length was 6-12 cm (mean, 10 cm), operative duration was 50-150 minutes (mean, 85 minutes), and intraoperative blood loss volume was 400-1,000 ml (mean, 500 ml). 18 patients were followed up for 12-36 months post-operation. In the results of X-ray films, 12 cases were anatomical reductions and the remaining cases were satisfactory reductions. According to Majeed standard, 13 patients were excellent and five patients were good. Treatment using the modified Stoppa approach was suitable for anterior approaches, in which pelvic and acetabular fractures were sufficiently exposed, the fracture was conveniently reduced, less complications occurred, and curative effect was satisfactory. <i>Level of evidence III, Retrospective comparative study.</i>
