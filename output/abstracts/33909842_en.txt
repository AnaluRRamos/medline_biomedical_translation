To verify the immediate effect of the Excitomotor Electrical Current, called Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES), on vocal quality, Maximum Phonation Time (MPT) and possible discomfort, in women without vocal alteration, with application at Maximum Supported Intensity (MSI) and associated with phonation. Experimental study with 20 normophonic adult women. They emitted the sustained vowel / a / and then it was applied to FES during emission of the same vowel. There were five series with three minutes of emission each, interspersed with passive rest. The electrical stimulus was at the MSI by the participant, adjusted by series. Before and after the emissions the voices were recorded and the MPT and the intensity of the stimuli were collected. The vocal quality was rated by judges. Statistical analysis made it possible to compare pre and post emission / electrostimulation data in each phase. Qualitative analysis was performed based on self-reported symptoms. There was no difference in vocal quality and MPT between pre and post moments in both phases. The difference between MSI and stimulus perception intensity was greater in series 1 than in series 2. There was an increase in MSI in series 5 compared to series 1. No significant negative symptoms or within 48h after procedures were reported. The FES at MSI, associated with phonation, did not generate an immediate change in vocal quality, in the MPT or self-reported discomforts by women without vocal alteration, even with a gradual increase in the stimulus, series by series.
