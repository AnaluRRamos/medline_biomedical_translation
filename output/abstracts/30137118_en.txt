The scope off this article is to assess the prevalence and identify associated factors with severe low back pain (LBP) during pregnancy among mothers living in Rio Grande, in the south of Brazil, in 2013. A standardized questionnaire was applied by trained interviewers within 48 hours after delivery. Multivariate analysis was carried out using Poisson regression. The prevalence ratio was the effect measure used. Among the 2,685 pregnant women enrolled in the study, 51.2% reported LBP and 27.3% reported severe LBP, which was more likely to occur among adolescents, with overweight/obese individuals, former smokers and those who practiced physical activity during pregnancy. Among those with severe LBP, 29.2%, 37.3% and 33.3% reported limitations for daily activities at home, had to seek medical care and had to miss work due to this problem, respectively. The prevalence of severe LBP during pregnancy is high and its impact for daily life and health services is concerning. The management of LBP should be part of routine pre-natal consultation.
