Patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome require ventilation strategies that have been shown to be important for reducing short-term mortality, such as protective ventilation and prone position ventilation. However, patients who survive have a prolonged stay in both the intensive care unit and the hospital, and they experience a reduction in overall satisfaction with life (independence, acceptance and positive outlook) as well as decreased mental health (including anxiety, depression and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms), physical health (impaired physical state and activities of daily living; fatigue and muscle weakness), social health and the ability to participate in social activities (including relationships with friends and family, hobbies and social gatherings).
