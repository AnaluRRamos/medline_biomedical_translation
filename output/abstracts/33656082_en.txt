Doxorubicin is associated with cardiotoxicity and late cardiac morbidity. Heme is related to cellular oxidative stress. However, its specific regulation in cardiomyocytes under doxorubicin effects has not yet been documented. This study seeks to evaluate the changing profiles of rate-limiting enzymes in the heme metabolism pathway under the effect of doxorubicin. H9c2 cardiomyocytes were incubated with doxorubicin at different concentrations (1,2,5,10μM respectively). The real-time PCR and Western Blot were used to determine the mRNA and protein expression for four pivotal enzymes (ALAS1, ALAS2, HOX-1, and HOX-2) regulating cellular heme metabolism, as well as the levels of heme were detected by ELISA. p<0.01 was considered significant. This study observed a dose-dependent changing pattern in heme levels in H9c2 cells with the highest level at the 5μM concentration for doxorubicin, which occurred synchronously with the highest upregulation level of ALAS1, as well as the degradative enzymes, HOX-1, and HOX-2 in mRNA and protein expression. By contrast, ALAS2, contrary to the increasing concentrations of doxorubicin, was found to be progressively down-regulated. The increase in ALAS1 expression may play a potential role in the heme level elevation when H9c2 cardiomyocyte was exposed to doxorubicin and may be a potential therapeutic target for doxorubicin-induced myocardial toxicity.
