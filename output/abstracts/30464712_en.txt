To introduce the intralesional calcitonin and methylprednisolone percutaneous injection method, which results in the promotion of primary aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC) healing. A retrospective cohort study involving 76 patients diagnosed with ABC was performed between 2005 and 2014. Patients treated with calcitonin and methylprednisolone injection and who underwent more than 2 years of follow-up were considered eligible for the study (n=47). The Enneking staging and Capanna classification systems were used during the initial evaluation. Treatment response was assessed by Rastogi radiographic grading based on the degree of healing. X<sup>2</sup> and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and odds ratio calculations were used in the statistical analysis with a 5% significance level. The proximal tibia extremity was the most commonly affected site (17.0%). Thirty-three (70.3%) ABC cases were staged as B3 and 28 (59.7%) were classified as type II. The average number of injections performed was 2.8 per patient, with an average reduction of the initial lytic area of 83.7% (p-value=0.00001). Satisfactory results for 91.4% (n=43; p-value=0.00001) were obtained and 5 recurrences occurred. No side effects were observed. Intralesional calcitonin and methylprednisolone percutaneous injection is a minimally invasive, effective, and safe method for promoting primary ABC healing. <b><i>Level of evidence IV, Type of study: case series.</i></b>
