In the cross-cultural adaptation of instruments, the qualitative component of adaptation is generally poorly reported, sometimes being superficially addressed. In this study we aimed to describe the qualitative component of the cross-cultural adaptation process and to demonstrate validity evidence based on test content of the Recovery Self-Assessment-RSA-R Family/Brazil. We conducted a qualitative study that included the steps of preparation, translation, back-translation, expert's assessment, workshop with a researcher from Yale University, and two pilot studies involving family members of patients attended at mental health services. Among the results, we found considerable validity evidence based on test content with a percentage of agreement above 80%. Pilot studies contributed to accentuating this evidence, assisting in the cultural adequacy of the statements and in the operational equivalence of the instrument. The adaptation process of the RSA-R Family/Brazil proved to be complex. From this experience, we concluded that presenting validity evidence based on test content is important to ensure the applicability tools to the target culture. The instrument will still be evaluated as for psychometric characteristics through statistical techniques.
