Stuttering has negative impacts on an individual's quality of life and is associated with higher risk of development of social and psychological problems. From this perspective, despite the diversity of etiological hypotheses for and treatments of stuttering, the interface between psychology and speech therapy in the approach to the biopsychic aspects involved in this clinical scenario stands out. Recent research indicates that the presence, specifically of dogs, can assist patients in symbolic elaboration of psychic content. From this perspective, the aim of this study is evaluate the effects of a dog's presence on the expression of the psychic content of a stuttering person, with the hypothesis that framing may reduce symptoms. The subject is M., female, 45 years old, married, without children, hairdressing assistant, with elementary school completed. She underwent the process of speech therapy in presence of a dog. A semidirected interview was conducted after this process. A co-therapist dog of Golden Retriever breed participated in all sessions. The relevant subjective content observed in the setting during the speech therapy process, which seems to have been mobilized by the framework established by the interaction among the therapist, the patient, and the dog, seems to demonstrate an association with the manifestation of disfluencies. The dog made physical contact with, supported, motivated and welcomed the subject in situations in which psychic conflicts were demonstrated. This clinical case study indicates that the dog's presence and interaction framework favored the reduction of stuttering symptoms, promoting welcoming environment that enabled the subject's psyche-soma integration.
