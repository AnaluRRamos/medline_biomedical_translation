To evaluate the National Immunization Program Immunization Surveillance System, based on its Vaccination Record module, for Brazil in 2017. This was a descriptive study using the Guidelines for Evaluating Public Health Surveillance Systems, published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC/Atlanta/GA/United States) to evaluate the attributes of simplicity, flexibility, data quality, sensitivity, timeliness and usefulness of the system for six vaccines on the child immunization schedule. The Immunization Surveillance System was considered complex in its description; flexible to changes in the immunization schedule; of poor data quality for the DTP and rotavirus vaccines; regular acceptability; high sensitivity for the BCG vaccine; untimely for the hepatitis B vaccine and useful for the purposes of the National Immunization Program. The data quality, acceptability and timeliness results were not satisfactory, so that actions are needed to enhance the information system.
