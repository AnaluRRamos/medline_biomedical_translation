The aim of this study was to analyze the relationship between Caregiver Distress and Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms in Dementias (BPSD) in mild Alzheimer's disease. Fifty patients and caregivers were interviewed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). 96.0% of the patients had at least one BPSD. The mean NPI total score was 19.6 (SD=18.05; range=0-78) whereas the mean Caregiver Distress Index (CDI) total score was 11.5 (SD=10.41; range=0-40). For the individual symptoms, the weighted mean CDI was 2.8 (SD=1.58). All symptom CDI means were higher than 2.0 except for euphoria/elation (m=1.8; SD=1.49). There were correlations between CDI and derived measures (Frequency, Severity, FxS, and Amplitude) for all symptoms, except Disinhibition and Night-time behavior. Correlations ranged between 0.443 and 0.894, with significance at p<0.05. All the derived measures, including amplitude, were useful in at least some cases. The data suggests that CDI cannot be inferred from symptom presence or profile. Symptoms should be systematically investigated.
