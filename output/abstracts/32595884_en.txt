Subjective Well-Being (SWB) is determined by the degree of satisfaction with one's own life and the intensity/frequency with which we experience negative and positive emotions. Current studies indicate that SWB is beneficial for health. The aim of this systematic review was to analyze the methodological quality of published articles on SWB in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The keywords 'Well-Being' and 'Alzheimer' were used. Inclusion criteria were a) articles with a sample of the elderly population; b) empirical articles; c) articles published between 2014 and 2019. Analysis of the selected articles was performed using the Downs and Black Checklist. 13 articles were selected for further analysis. The results showed that only one of the articles reached a high methodological quality level. The other articles had an average level, ranging from 46% to 67%, of total protocol compliance. The studies analyzed had a medium level of methodological quality. It is important to improve the methodological quality of studies on SWB in people with AD.
