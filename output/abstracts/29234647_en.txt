To evaluate the correlation between radiographic parameters of the proximal femur with femoral neck fractures or transtrochanteric fractures. Cervicodiaphyseal angle (CDA), femoral neck width (FNW), hip axis length (HAL), and acetabular tear drop distance (ATD) were analyzed in 30 pelvis anteroposterior view X-rays of patients with femoral neck fractures (<i>n</i> = 15) and transtrochanteric fractures (<i>n</i> = 15). The analysis was performed by comparing the results of the X-rays with femoral neck fractures and with transtrochanteric fractures. No statistically significant differences between samples were observed. There was no correlation between radiographic parameters evaluated and specific occurrence of femoral neck fractures or transtrochanteric fractures.
