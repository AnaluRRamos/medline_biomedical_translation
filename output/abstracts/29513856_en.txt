This study aims to describe methodological approaches to measure and monitor health inequalities and to illustrate their applicability. The measures most frequently used in the literature were reviewed. Data on coverage and quality of pre-natal care in Brazil, from the Demographic and Maternal and Child Health Survey (PNDS-2006) and the National Health Survey (PNS-2013) were used to illustrate their applicability. Absolute and relative measures of inequalities were presented, highlighting their complementary character. Despite the progress achieved in the national indicators of pre-natal care, important inequalities were still identified between population subgroups, with no change in the magnitude of the differences throughout the studied period. Brazil has important social inequalities, whose consequences still lead to health inequalities. Their description and monitoring are highly relevant to support polices focused on those vulnerable population groups who have been left behind.
