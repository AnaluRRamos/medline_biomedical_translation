The experience with an intervention program conducted in an educational institution and targeted to families of children with congenital Zika syndrome, which includes multiple disabilities, revealed the challenges and strides with the entry of these families in the school system. This article aimed to explore the findings from a study conducted after the conclusion of an intervention program, using semi-open interviews with professional staff at the institution and the possible contributions towards establishing inter-sector relations aimed at school inclusion of children with disabilities. A change was seen, as a result of the program, in the relationship between the families and the professionals at the educational institution, whereby the families had room to voice their fears and discuss the school's role in the lives of their children with disabilities. The professionals thus came to see the families taking a more active stance. This experience can favor other services and municipalities that seek school inclusion for children and adolescents with disabilities, as well as their social inclusion and that of their families.
