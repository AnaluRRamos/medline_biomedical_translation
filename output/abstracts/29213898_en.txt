In the present paper we present an observational study of the implementation of a Neuropsychological Stimulation Program at an Elderly Day Care Center in low-educated participants with very similar backgrounds concerning social economic status. The implemented program tackled several dimensions, including daily orientation sessions, cognitive stimulation sessions twice a week, followed by movement sessions, and structured sessions conducted every two weeks. Cognitive Evaluation was performed before and after implementation of the program. Results are discussed taking into consideration cognitive outputs as well as non-cognitive outputs and the specificities of community-based intervention. It was concluded that community-based intervention is set to become vital in promoting dementia prevention.
