Cognitive aging is dynamic and heterogeneous in elderly, thus adequate tools such as paper-based tests are relevant to describe the cognitive profile of this population. To describe different paper-based cognitive assessments tests in elderly people stratified by age and education. A cross-sectional study of 667 elderly (≥60 years) living in the community was conducted. Sociodemographic information was collected. Global cognition was assessed by the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised (ACE-R), Mini Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (M-ACE) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, the t-test and Pearson's Correlation Coefficient. The findings showed a predominance of women (53.8%), mean age of 71.3 (±7.7) years and 3.6 (±3.5) years of education. The best global cognitive performance and cognitive domain assessment scores were found in the group with higher formal educational level. Each year of education was associated with an increase of up to 10% in scores on the M-ACE and MMSE and up to 11% in ACE-R scores. The mean values of the scores varied according to age, where the 60-69 years group had better scores than other age groups. The correlation matrix between the cognitive tests showed that near perfect correlations (r=1) were frequent in the subgroup with higher education. Younger elderly and those with higher educational level had greater global and domain scores. This study describes the scores of elderly for different strata of education and age. In practice, it is important to choose the most suitable screening instrument, considering the characteristics of the elderly.
