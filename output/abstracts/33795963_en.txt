To report the incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in ipsilateral femur and tibial fractures (floating knee). This is a retrospective, analytical, observational study conducted with the medical records of thirty patients admitted to a trauma hospital between October 2016 and July 2017 with floating knee. Patients aged between 21-30 years were the most affected by the condition (36%). Seventeen patients affected the dominant limb (57%); 19 (63%) patients were classified as Fraser type I, 18 (60%) had open (compound) fractures, 16 (53%) tibial fractures, and 8 (26%) femoral fractures. External fixation of the femur and tibia (25 patients = 83%) was the most common emergency treatment. In total, 17% of patients presented deep venous thrombosis (p = 0.409). Despite antithrombotic prophylaxis, the incidence of DVT in the affected limb of patients with floating knee was high. We found patients with Fraser I fractures, male, and with fractures in the non-dominant limb to present a higher chance of developing DVT. <i>Level of Evidence III, Comparative retrospective study .</i>
