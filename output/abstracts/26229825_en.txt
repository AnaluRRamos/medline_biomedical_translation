to review the medical files of 19 patients with a diagnosis of amyoplasia, who underwent percutaneous extensor osteotomy of the distal femur to correct deformities in whom the knees were fixed in flexion. we analyzed 37 osteotomy procedures on 35 knees that presented an initial deformity in which the knees were fixed in flexion at 33.8°. All of these knees underwent percutaneous extensor osteotomy of the distal femur and were followed up for a mean period of 73.7 months. we observed recurrence of the deformity in 29 osteotomy cases, i.e. in 78.4% of them. The mean recurrence velocity of the deformity was 0.69°/month. percutaneous extensor osteotomy of the distal femur provided sufficient correction of deformities in which the knee was fixed in flexion in these amyoplasia cases, but there was a significant degree of recurrence among the patients analyzed.
