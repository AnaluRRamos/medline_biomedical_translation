The public health network of the Federal District, as in the rest of the Brazilian Unified Health System, suffers from inefficiencies related to the difficulty in hiring and managing professionals, as well as the implementation of supply and maintenance contracts. In Brasilia, a new management model was implemented in 2018 in its largest hospital. With the creation of the autonomous social service 'Instituto Hospital de Base', a health unit in operation since 1960, the possibility of providing agility to these contracts was opened, in addition to establishing a management based on goals and outcome indicators, with expressive efficiency gains. This article reports the steps for the implementation of this decentralized model of hospital management, the alternatives considered, the difficulties faced and some of the first results of this new model. One can already verify and affirm the success of the legal-administrative model of 'Instituto Hospital de Base', which can serve as a paradigm for other health units in the Federal District and in Brazil.
