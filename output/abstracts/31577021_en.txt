This paper aimed to evaluate food consumption of bank employees and its association with socioeconomic, behavioral and labor factors. This is a cross-sectional study with 515 bank employees. To evaluate food consumption, a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire was used. The analysis of main components with Varimax rotation was used to determine the dietary patterns. Three dietary patterns were identified: 'vegetables, fruits, cereals and tubers', 'sweets and snacks' and 'traditional and protein'. We found that individuals who did not consume sweeteners were more likely to adhere to the 'vegetables, fruits, cereals and tubers' pattern and were less likely to adhere to the 'sweets and snacks' and 'traditional and protein' patterns. Bank employees who rarely ate in restaurants were three times more likely to adhere to the 'sweets and snacks' pattern. However, those who used to consume industrialized seasoning and those who reported receiving low social support were, respectively, 2.3 and 1.5 times more likely to adhere to the 'traditional and protein' pattern. We can conclude that food consumption of bank employees is not related to the sociodemographic conditions of these individuals, and behavior and perception of social support received is associated with these dietary patterns.
