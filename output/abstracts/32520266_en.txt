Populational ageing is a current phenomenon and calls for the reconfiguration of health services and expansion of access for the elderly. This is a cross-sectional study with 6,624 elderly Brazilians over 60 that set out to evaluate access to healthcare by measuring lack of access and by describing the trajectory until recourse to hospitalization, emergency care and medical visits. The variables were analyzed according to the nature of funding to access the service (SUS, private insurance and cash-payment). The prevalence of lack of access was 2.5% (CI95% 1.6;4.0) for hospitalizations, 2.1% (CI95% 1.4; 3.1) for emergency rooms, and 0.6% (CI95% 0.3;0.9) for medical visits. SUS accounted for most of the care provided. Positive aspects of SUS were the higher number of medical visits in the city of residence and less money spent on transport. The private system stands out for the low frequency of long waiting times and higher frequency of referrals to return visits after hospitalization. The findings highlight the importance of SUS in Brazil in promoting equality and universality despite the existing deficiencies. In both public and private systems, greater articulation among the healthcare levels is required for integral healthcare to elderly individuals.
