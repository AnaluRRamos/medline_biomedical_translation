To describe quality of life and related factors in a sample of Colombian caregivers of people with cancer in palliative care. A correlational, descriptive and cross-sectional study conducted with 208 family caregivers of people with cancer in outpatient palliative care in Medell√≠n, Colombia. The Quality of Life in Life-Threatening Illness - Family Caregiver Version (QOLLTI-F) instrument was used. Quality of life obtained scores between 116.36 and 122.35 (95%CI). The dimensions with the lowest scores were Patient condition (2.4-3.2, 95%CI), Caregiver's own state (36.2-39.9, 95% CI) and Environment (14.4-15.7, 95%CI). The patient's and caregiver's ages and the Karnofsky index presented a positive correlation, from weak to moderate and significant with the caregiver's quality of life. The daily hours devoted to care presented a weak correlation, negative and significant, with the overall quality of life and with the Caregiver's own state dimension. It is necessary to develop interventions to improve quality of life in caregivers of people with advanced cancer in the palliative phase, considering the importance of relief actions and the management of the patient's functional dependence.
