To identify studies on the competence of <i>Culex</i> mosquitoes as vectors for the transmission of Zika virus (ZIKV) around the globe. We performed an integrative review to identify relevant articles on specific experiments to determine whether <i>Culex</i> mosquitoes are vectors for ZIKV. The sources we used for our research were the Brazilian Peri√≥dicos CAPES electronic portal (MEDLINE/PubMed, ScienceDirect Journals, Nature Publishing Group, SciELO, Springer Link, and 250 other databases) and gray literature. We identified 344 studies, of which 36 were considered for this review. In 8 studies, infection in salivary glands of <i>Culex quinquefasciatus</i>, <i>Culex restuans, Culex tarsalis</i>, and <i>Culex coronator</i> was detected. <i>Cx. quinquefasciatus</i> was the most studied among those confirmed as potential ZIKV vectors, and only strains of Asian lineages (THA/2014/SV0127-14; SZ01 (2016)) and American lineages (BRPE243 (2015); PRVABC59 (2015)) can infect the salivary glands of <i>Culex</i> mosquitoes. The tested African strains (MR766 and DAK AR 41525) were unable to infect salivary glands. There is still a lack of compelling evidence that indicates <i>Culex</i> spp. are a competent ZIKV vector, but they should remain a target for further monitoring studies, especially regarding ZIKV transmission to other species. Furthermore, studies should not be limited to studying whether their salivary glands are infected.
