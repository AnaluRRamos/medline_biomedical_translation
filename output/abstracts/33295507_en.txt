A systematic review conducted in January 2020 using SciELO database with the objective of analyzing the scientific production from 1996-2019, of the Journal Ciência & Saúde Coletiva in the area of food and nutrition. We selected 509 out of the 904 articles screened by titles and abstracts. We grouped the articles into ten themes and discussed the most frequent ones: Nutritional Status Assessment (n=142), Food Intake (n=111), Food and Nutrition Policies and Programmes (n=105) and Breastfeeding (n=35). The publications were mostly original articles (75.6%) employing quantitative method (81.6%) and, among these, 18.8% used a probabilistic sampling. We assembled a wide range of topics and subthemes, a relevant production and repository of data and knowledge for health professionals and managers. As gaps, there was a scarcity of publications focused on micronutrient deficiency; the promotion of the Food Guide for the Brazilian Population; supporting the rise of breastfeeding, the impact and analyses of the disruption of the National Food and Nutrition Security Policy and its multi sector interactions with social policies to fight hunger.
