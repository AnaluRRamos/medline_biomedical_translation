To explore and describe the experiences and perspectives of various stakeholders regarding the use of powered wheelchair standing devices (PWSDs). The purposive sample included: children aged 6 to 18 years who used a PWSD (n=8; diagnoses: cerebral palsy, spinal muscular atrophy, spina bifida, spinal cord injury), parents of children 18 years of age or younger who used a PWSD (n=12), rehabilitation professionals working with children who used a PWSD (n=12), and professionals working at companies manufacturing PWSDs (n=3). Data were gathered via face-to-face interviews conducted either in person or via Zoom<sup>Â®</sup> and analyzed using the constant comparative method. Three main themes emerged in the data: (1) 'Stand-on-demand' revealed how participants perceived PWSDs as allowing children to stand whenever and wherever they wanted, thereby increasing participation; (2) 'It's more than weight-bearing' uncovered participants' perceptions of psychological and physical benefits from PWSD use; and (3) 'Ecosystems influencing PWSD acquisition and use' revealed child- and non-child-related factors perceived as influencing children's procurement and use of a PWSD. Use of a PWSD was perceived as providing a unique opportunity for children to stand whenever and wherever they desired. Findings suggest the possible transdiagnostic application of PWSDs. What this paper adds The ability to stand when desired was unique to powered wheelchair standing device (PWSD) use. Participants perceived numerous psychological and physical benefits from PWSD use. Child- and non-child-related factors influenced procurement and use of a PWSD.
