To compare the outcomes of patients with stage II SNAC submitted to surgical treatment by proximal row carpectomy (PRC) or four-corner fusion (FCF). Twenty-seven patients aged 18-59 years (mean 37.52 years) were included. Thirteen patients underwent PRC in Group A, and 14 underwent FCF of the wrist in Group B. Evaluations were made before and after surgery with follow-up between 45 and 73 months. Range of motion (ROM); pain assessment with a visual analog scale (VAS); grip strength; disability of the arm, shoulder, and hand (DASH); and return to work were evaluated. Group A patients had 68.5% and Group B patients, 58.01% of the ROM of the contralateral side. The VAS score was 2.3 in Group A and 2.9 in Group B. Grip strength was 78.67% and 65.42%, respectively, relative to the side not affected. The DASH score was 11 for PRC and 13 for FCF. In Group A, 9/13 (69.23%) and in Group B, 8/14 (57.14%) patients are currently working. Complications were symptomatic osteoarthritis in the mid-carpal joint in Group A and loosening of a screw in Group B. The clinical and functional results do not present statistically significant differences for both analyzed methods.
