Scratching behaviours associated with intradermal (i.d.) injection of pruritogens such as histamine and compound 48/80 into the skin of mice and humans is the commonly used model to advance itch research and drug development. The predictive validity of this model is poorly documented in dogs. To evaluate the dose-dependent effects of pruritogenic substances, each with a different mechanism of action, in healthy dogs. Ten healthy laboratory beagles. All dogs were video-recorded for 30 min post-injection (mpi) of i.d. goat anti-canine IgE (4 and 25 μg/site), histamine and compound 48/80 (50, 100, 200, 400 μg/site); two buffered saline injections served as controls. Two blinded investigators reviewed the pruritic behaviours of all video recordings. Global wheal scores were evaluated at 30 min by a blinded investigator. All dogs showed wheal and erythema at the pruritogen injection site; global wheal scores at 30 min of each substance significantly increased at all concentrations compared to control (P ≤ 0.05). A blinded evaluation revealed that all pruritogens induced mild acute pruritic behaviours at the site of injection. There was no injection site pain seen in any dog. Compared to controls, injections of pruritogens did not significantly affect the pruritic seconds or occurrence of pruritic episodes for any of the substances. These preliminary results suggest that i.d. injections of the studied pruritogens can induce cutaneous wheal and flare response in healthy dogs; but inconsistencies occur in the induction of itch, even with the different concentrations of pruritogens.
