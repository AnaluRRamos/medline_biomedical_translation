Peripheral neuroblastic tumours arising from primitive cells of the cranial and spinal ganglia and from sympathetic ganglion cells of the autonomic nervous system include, from most to least differentiated, ganglioneuroma, ganglioneuroblastoma and neuroblastoma. Canine ganglioneuroblastoma has been described in the mediastinum, nasal and oral cavities, as well as in the brain. To describe the clinical and histopathological findings, treatment and follow-up of a primary cutaneous ganglioneuroblastoma affecting the footpad of a dog. An 8-year-old male German shepherd dog, referred for left forelimb lameness and licking of the footpad, showed thickening of the footpad of digit V with a central nodular lesion. Histopathological and immunohistochemical examination on a surgical skin biopsy specimen showed an infiltrative and highly cellular neoplasm in the deep dermis. The neoplasm was composed of large polyhedral cells with abundant cytoplasm containing Nissl substance that reacted strongly with neuron-specific enolase and neuronal nuclei antigen, spindle cells with indistinct cell borders suggestive of Schwann cells, with a mild S-100 and GFAP immunoreactivity, and rare nests of neuroblasts. The owner agreed to digit amputation. Histologically, a neoplastic multinodular proliferation with morphological findings like those detected in the biopsy was observed, not extended to the surgical margins and without involvement of skeletal bone. No recurrence or metastasis was observed over a period of one year. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of a primary cutaneous ganglioneuroblastoma in a dog. Ganglioneuroblastoma should be included in the differential diagnoses of canine footpad neoplastic diseases.
