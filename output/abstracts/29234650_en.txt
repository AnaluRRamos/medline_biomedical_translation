The aim of the study is to evaluate the clinical and functional outcome in treatment of infected tibial nonunion by the Ilizarov method. The authors retrospectively analyzed 42 patients with infected tibial nonunion with bone loss; shortening and deformity treated at this institution during the period of February 2012 to April 2015 were included in the study. The results were evaluated according to Association for the Study and Application of the Methods of Ilizarov (ASAMI) criteria. Pin tract infections were assessed by Moore and Dahl score. Bone results were excellent in 60% of patients (<i>n</i> = 25), good in 15% (<i>n</i> = 6), fair in 25% (<i>n</i> = 11), and poor in none. The functional results were excellent in 55% of patients, good in 30%, fair in 5%, and poor in 10%. The most common complication found in this study was pin tract infection. Ilizarov ring fixator still remains an excellent treatment modality for tibial nonunion, as it addresses the problems associated with the condition, although the procedure is cumbersome.
