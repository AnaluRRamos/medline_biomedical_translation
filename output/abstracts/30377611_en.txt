To evaluate the microfracture intervention with tibial valgus osteotomy associated in the treatment of varus gonarthrosis. From November 2005 to May 2013, 129 patients with medial gonarthrosis, varus deformity (8°-12°), and range of movement greater than 90° were evaluated. Patients with advanced gonarthrosis (Alhbäck 3, 4, and 5), Outerbridge lesion inferior to IV, previous knee surgery, body mass index greater than 35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and/or cruciate ligament injuries were not included. All patients were treated with videoarthroscopy followed by tibial valgus osteotomy. In the group osteotomy associated with microfracture (<i>n</i> = 56, mean age = 39.3), tibial valgus osteotomy and microfracture techniques to address chondral defects were used. In the isolated osteotomy group (<i>n</i> = 73, mean age = 41.4), only this procedure was performed. Post-surgical follow-up was 24 months, with four evaluations in the first 6 months, proceeding to biannual twice-a-year evaluation in the subsequent period. The Lysholm scale was used for functional monitoring. There was a significant improvement in the pain, limping, and squatting domains of the Lysholm scale but only in the isolated osteotomy group. A greater variance of results was observed in the osteotomy group associated to microfracture, in addition to an increased risk of functional deterioration (OR = 8.64). The association of microfractures and tibial valgus osteotomy was correlated to lower functional outcomes than tibial valgus osteotomy alone, and may be related to the risk of worsening in the first two postoperative years.
