Chagas disease (CD) remains a major cause of stroke in developing countries, but cognitive repercussion of CD has not been well studied. To compare the frequency and pattern of cognitive dysfunction in patients with CD cardiomyopathy (CDC) and other cardiomyopathies (OC). We studied 37 patients with CDC and 42 patients with OC with similar age, educational level and cardiac systolic function. Cognitive tests were applied to both groups by a single examiner blinded to CD status. Logistic regression multivariable models were constructed to ascertain predictors of cognitive dysfunction for each test. Cognitive dysfunction was detected in 9 (24%) CDC patients and 6 (14%) OC patients by Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) corrected for educational level. Independent predictors of abnormal MMSE (p<0.05) included stroke history (OR=5.51; 95% CI=1.27-24.01) and digoxin use (OR=0.23, 95% CI=0.06-0.89), while CD showed a trend toward statistical significance (OR=4.63; 95% CI=0.87-24.73, <i>p=</i>0.07). Delayed recall of Rey's Complex Figure Test was significantly worse in CD patients, where this remained a significant predictor in the multivariable analysis (OR=4.67; 95% CI=1.23-17.68). Cognitive dysfunction is frequent in Chagas disease and should be considered as an outcome measure in Chagas disease studies.
