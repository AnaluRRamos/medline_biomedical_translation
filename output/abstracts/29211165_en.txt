This article analyzes the feasibility of implementing a program that monitors the hearing and language development in the first year of life. It is a prospective longitudinal study, in which 41 community health workers were invited to monitor, on a monthly basis, by means of a questionnaire validated earlier, the hearing and language of children born in their micro areas of expertise. Thirty-nine community health workers agreed to participate, with only two refusals. Five gave up participating. Twenty-six (66.66%) did not perform monitoring, seven (17.94%) monitored improperly and only six (15.38%) monitored properly. Just one child failed the quiz, who was forwarded to the hospital that conducted the auditory screening for retesting. These professionals' high activity demand was considered the main reason for the difficulties encountered in this project. In addition, there is the difficulty to have contact with the Family Health Strategy teams, as well as the impossibility of permanent face-to-face discussions and the influence of the community health agents' supervisors.
