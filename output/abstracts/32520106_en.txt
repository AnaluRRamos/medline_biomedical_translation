To compare the distribution of chronic non-communicable diseases (CNCD) indicators among adult female beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries of the Bolsa Fam√≠lia Program (BFP) in Brazilian capitals. Analysis of Vigitel telephone survey data in 2016 and 2017. Gross and adjusted prevalence ratios (PR) and their respective confidence intervals were estimated using Poisson Regression model. Women with BF have lower schooling, are young people, live more frequently in the Northeast and North of the country. Higher prevalence of risk factors were found in woman receiving BF. The adjusted PR of the BF women were: smokers (PR = 1.98), overweight (PR = 1.21), obesity (PR = 1.63), fruits and vegetables (PR = 0.63), consumption of soft drinks (PR = 1.68), bean consumption (PR = 1.25), physical activity at leisure (PR = 0.65), physical activity at home (PR = 1.35), time watching TV (PR = 1.37), self-assessment of poor health status (PR =2.04), mammography (PR = 0.86), Pap smears (PR = 0.91), hypertension (PR = 1.46) and diabetes (PR = 1,66). When women were compared among strata of the same schooling, these differences were reduced. Worst indicators among women receiving BF reflect social inequalities inherent in this most vulnerable group. The study also shows that BF is being targeted at the most vulnerable women.
