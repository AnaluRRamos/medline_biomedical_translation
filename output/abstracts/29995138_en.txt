To analyze the association between self-perception of sleep quality and assimilation of content covered in classes by adolescents. Epidemiological cross-sectional study conducted with 481 high-school students (14 to 19 years), both genders, enrolled in public schools in the city of Caruaru, Pernambuco, and selected by random cluster sampling strategy. Analyses were conducted using the Chi-square test and binary logistic regression. 44.1% of the adolescents reported learning difficulties during classes, 77.1% slept less than eight hours per day, and 28.9% had a bad perception of their sleep quality. Young people who studied at least one extra hour per day out of school had less difficulty in assimilating class content (OR=0.34; 95%CI 0.19-0.58). We also found that participants who reported a bad perception of sleep quality were more likely to have learning difficulties at school (OR=1.73; 95%CI 1.13-2.65) regardless of gender, age, school shift, study time out of school, and sleeping hours. Perception of sleep quality was associated with learning difficulties at school regardless of the number of sleeping and study hours.
