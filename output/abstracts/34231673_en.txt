This study aimed to verify the association between work and sociodemographic factors, health behaviors, and cardiovascular risk in Brazilian adolescents. Data from the Study of Cardiovascular Risks in Adolescents (ERICA) were analyzed, with a sample of 37,815 adolescents aged 12-17 years and morning shift students. Considering complex sampling, crude and adjusted Prevalence Ratios (PR) were calculated with interval estimates for variables by Poisson multiple regression model with robust variance estimate. The sociodemographic factors associated with work among Brazilian adolescents were male gender (PR 1.34), aged 15-17 years, with maternal schooling up to elementary school (PR 1.26), public school students (PR 1.63), and from the rural area (PR 1.90). Regarding lifestyle habits and social behavior, the association was significant in physically active (PR 1.19) and alcohol-consuming students (PR 1.35). In conclusion, work among Brazilian adolescent morning shift students is still strongly linked to social issues. Work was associated with alcohol consumption, and there was no association with metabolic markers.
