In 2003, academic staff members at The University of the West Indies Faculty of Medical Sciences St Augustine Trinidad and Tobago combined their expertise to make strides in Alzheimer's and Dementia research in Trinidad and Tobago. Dr. Nelleen Baboolal, Dr. Gershwin Davis and Professor Amanda McRae began developing a project that has produced significant results by examining not only the epidemiology of dementia, but the associated risk factors; caregiver burden and ultimately establishing biomarkers for the disease. This review is an account of our results from a decade of dementia research and how they are contributing toward mitigating the dementia tsunami in Trinidad and Tobago.
