The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of bleaching protocols on the surface roughness (Ra), color change and surface micromorphology of a low-viscosity bulk-fill composite (Filtek Bulk Fill Flow, 3M ESPE), a highviscosity bulk-fill composite (Filtek Bulk Fill, 3M ESPE) and a conventional nanoparticulate composite resin (control) (Filtek Z350 XT, 3M ESPE). Forty samples of each composite (disks 5 mm in diameter and 2 mm thick) were randomly divided into four groups (n=10), according to bleaching protocol: a) 10% carbamide peroxide gel (Opalescence, Ultradent Products) (2 h/ day, for 14 days); b) 40% hydrogen peroxide gel (Opalescence Boost, Ultradent Products) (three bleaching sessions, once a week, 45 min/session); c) whitening rinse (Listerine Whitening Extreme, Johnson & Johnson) (2 min/day, for 14 days); and d) distilled water (control). The samples were submitted to triplicate readings (Ra and color [CIELAB parameters]) before and after contact with bleaching protocols. Micromorphology was analyzed in a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Ra and color parameters (ΔL, Δa, Δb and ΔE) were analyzed by generalized linear models (α=0.05). The Ra of the high-viscosity bulk-fill was significantly higher than that of the other composites (p<0.05). Ra increased significantly (p<0.05) and surface became more irregular (SEM analysis) in all the composite resins, regardless of the bleaching protocol (p<0.05). The high-viscosity bulk-fill composite resin group had significantly lower ΔE (p<0.05) than the nanoparticulate composite resin group immersed in distilled water. It was concluded that the characteristics of each resin significantly influenced the Ra more than the bleaching protocol. The high-viscosity bulk-fill resin presented minor color change.
