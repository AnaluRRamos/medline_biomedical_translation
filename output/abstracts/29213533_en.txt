qEEG spectral analysis has been considered highly sensitive to cortical functional changes and agrees strongly with the clinical diagnosis of AD. The sensitivity of spectral analysis has ranged from 71% to 81% in several studies.<sup>1-3</sup>. The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate whether alpha qEEG spectral peak can supplement clinical examination by constituting an independent tool to monitor treatment and follow-up of dementia progression in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In addition, we examined the demographic data and alpha power spectra distribution of patients and elderly normal controls. qEEGs were selected from 2 groups of patients: normal controls (n=30), and patients who fulfilled criteria for mild probable AD diagnosis (n=41). The alpha qEEG spectral analysis and MMSE were performed once or twice a year. In our groups, MMSE scores and qEEG alpha spectral peak were unchanged (no statistical differences) after anticholinesterase use where qEEG spectral peak was never lower than 8 Hz in the control group. This study supports two important concepts. First, 8 Hz alpha appears to be the lowest awake spectral peak compatible with normality. And finally, in a clinical context, qEEG is a valuable diagnostic tool that could prove useful for Dementia follow-up.
