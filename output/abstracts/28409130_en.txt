Clinical and functional assessment of the surgical treatment for acute injury of the distal insertion of the biceps brachial performed with a surgical technique using a single incision in proximal forearm and fixation with suture anchors in the radial tuberosity. This study reviewed the medical records of patients who underwent surgical treatment of distal biceps injury during the period between January 2008 and July 2014. In a mean follow-up of 12 months, 22 patients with complete and acute injury, diagnosed through physical examination and imaging studies, were functionally assessed in the postoperative period regarding the range of motion (degrees of flexion-extension and pronation-supination), the presence of pain (VAS), the Andrews Carson-score, and the Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS). During the postoperative follow-up assessment, no patient reported pain by VAS scale; all were satisfied with the esthetic appearance of the surgery. The range of articular movement remained unchanged at 95.4% of patients, with the loss of 8Â° of supination in one patient. No changes in muscle strength were observed. The results of the Andrews-Carson score were good in 4.6% and excellent in 95.4% of cases; the MEPS presented 100% of excellent results. The rate of complications was 27.2%, similar to the literature. Surgical repair of acute injury of the distal biceps trough a single incision in the proximal forearm and fixation with two suture anchors in the radial tuberosity is an effective and safe therapeutic option, allowing early motion and good functional results.
