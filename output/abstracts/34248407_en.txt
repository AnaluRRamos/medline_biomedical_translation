To investigate the relationship between anthropometry and body composition with dynamic postural balance in elderly women with low bone mineral density (BMD). 45 older women (≥ 60 years), low BMD and nutritional diagnosis of low weight to overweight. For the assessment of body composition, Dual energy X-ray emission densitometry and anthropometric examination were used to measure: body mass (kg), height (cm) and BMI (k/m<sup>2</sup>). The assessment of dynamic postural balance was performed by the mini Balance Master Evaluation System clinical test and the computerized Balance Master<sup>®</sup> System test by the Sit to Stand and Step Up/Over tests. There was a negative correlation between miniBESTest (r = - 0.566; p ≤ 0.001) and time to ascend and descend step (r = - 0.393; p ≤ 0.007) with fat mass, and positive correlation with miniBESTest (r = 0.526; p ≤0.001) and time to go up and down a step with muscle mass (r = 0.297; p ≤ 0.04). As for anthropometric variables, only height showed a positive correlation (r = 0.296; p ≤ 0.04) with the speed in the sit and stand test. Lean mass reduces postural oscillations; in contrast, fat mass negatively interfered with dynamic postural balance in women with low BMD. Height was related to dynamic postural balance, the taller the elderly, the worse their balance. <b><i>Level of Evidence II, Prognostic Studies - Investigating the Effect of a Patient Characteristic on the Outcome of Disease.</i></b>
