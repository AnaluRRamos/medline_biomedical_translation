Metabolic syndrome is characterized by an array of comorbidities. During this syndrome, structural changes are observed in the cardiovascular system, especially vascular remodeling. One of the predisposing causes for these changes is chronic inflammation resulting from changes in the structure and composition of perivascular adipose tissue. Atorvastatin is effective in the treatment of dyslipidemias. However, its pleiotropic effects have not been completely understood. We hypothesize that metabolic syndrome may lead to vascular remodeling and that atorvastatin therapy may be able to attenuate this condition. To assess the effects of atorvastatin therapy on vascular remodeling in an experimental model of metabolic syndrome. Swiss mice received a control diet or a hyperglicemic diet for 18 weeks. After 14 weeks of diet, mice were treated with vehicle or atorvastatin (20mg/kg) during for 4 weeks. Nutritional and metabolic profiles were assessed by biochemical tests; moreover, a histological assessment of aorta structure was conducted, and cytokine levels were determined by the immunoenzyme assay. The acceptable level of significance for the results was set at p<0.05. Hyperglicemic diet promoted the development of metabolic syndrome. It indeed culminated in hypertrophic remodeling of vascular smooth muscle and perivascular adipose tissue. Furthermore, there were increases in the levels of circulating TNF-Î± and IL-6 and in the perivascular adipose tissue. Atorvastatin therapy significantly reduced metabolic damages, vascular remodeling, and cytokine levels. Atorvastatin attenuate metabolic damages associated with metabolic syndrome induced by hyperglycemic diet, in addition to attenuating vascular remodeling; both effects are associated with reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
