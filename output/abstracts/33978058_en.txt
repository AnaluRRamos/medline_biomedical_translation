To investigate the association between oral-motor disorder and feeding difficulty during the process of introducing complementary feeding in preterm infants. This is a cross-sectional, observational, and quantitative study. Preterm infants who had already begun complementary feeding and were up to 24 months corrected gestational age, were followed up at an outpatient clinic for high-risk newborns. The feeding difficulty was assessed using the mother's perception of the presence of defensive behaviors in their child. The measurement of the oral motor skills performance was obtained through the application of an adaptation of the Clinical evaluation protocol of pediatric dysphagia (PAD-PED). The sample consisted of 62 dyads of children with a mean corrected gestational age (CGA) of 13.5 months. Complementary feeding was introduced at the sixth month CGA by almost half of the mothers and most of them reported some sort of difficulty with this activity. Extreme prematurity revealed an association with defensive feeding behavior (p = 0.005), as well as with the initial introduction of food with liquid consistency (p = 0.001), the extended period of time using enteral tube feeding (p = 0.044), the continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) (p = 0.013) and parenteral nutrition (p = 0.039). There was no significant association between oral motor disorder and feeding difficulty.
