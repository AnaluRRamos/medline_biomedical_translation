To describe the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of patients with septic arthritis of the shoulder or elbow and to evaluate prognostic factors for complications during treatment. A retrospective case series was studied with patients treated between 2004 and 2014. The patients' clinical and epidemiological characteristics were collected. The clinical and orthopedic complications were identified and possible prognostic factors were evaluated. Twenty-seven patients were analyzed, 17 with septic arthritis of the shoulder and ten of the elbow. Median age was 46 years (IQR, 24.5; 61). Previous joint disease was observed in nine patients (33%). At least one clinical comorbidity was observed in 23 patients (85%). <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> was identified in 14 cases (52%). Fourteen patients (52%) had at least one clinical complication and five patients died (19%). Nine patients (33%) had some type of orthopedic complication. The time between onset of symptoms and surgical treatment was longer in patients with orthopedic complications (<i>p</i> = 0.020). Regarding the development of clinical complications, leukocytosis on hospital admission time (<i>p</i> = 0.021) and the presence of clinical morbidities (<i>p</i> = 0.041) were predictive factors. Septic arthritis of the shoulder and elbow primarily affects individuals who are immunocompromised and/or have clinical comorbidities. <i>S. aureus</i> is the most common pathogen in Brazil. Leukocytosis at hospital admission and the presence of clinical comorbidities are factors associated with the presence of clinical complications. Longer time between onset of symptoms and surgical treatment was correlated with orthopedic complications.
