To evaluate computed tomography (CT) findings in 23 patients with bronchial atresia. The CT images were reviewed by two radiologists who reached decisions by consensus. We included only patients who presented with abnormalities on CT and in whom the diagnosis had been confirmed by pathological examination of the surgical specimen (if the lesion was resected). The CT scans were assessed in order to identify the main findings and to map the distribution of the lesions (i.e., to determine whether the pulmonary involvement was unilateral or bilateral). The main CT finding was the combination of bronchocele and hyperinflation of the distal lung. That combination was observed in all of the patients. The lesions were unilateral in all 23 cases, being seen predominantly in the left upper lobe, followed by the right lower lobe, right upper lobe, middle lobe, and left lower lobe. The diagnosis of bronchial atresia can be reliably made on the basis of a finding of bronchocele accompanied by hyperinflation of the adjacent lung parenchyma.
