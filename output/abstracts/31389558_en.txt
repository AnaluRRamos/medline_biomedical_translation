This study refers to the impact of the use of pesticides on human health in the SÃ£o Francisco River Valley region, in which, through semi-structured interviews, the objective was to analyze the influence of social, cultural and economic determinants on the health-disease process of workers exposed to agrochemicals. For data collection, 339 rural workers from irrigated perimeters of the cities of Juazeiro, in the State of Bahia, and Petrolina, in the State of Pernambuco, were interviewed. All were male, of which 182 (53,7%) were rural owners and 157 (46,3%) were employees, predominantly between 40 and 59 years of age among owners and under 39 among workers. Over 50% have a low level of schooling and 55.2% of them have monthly incomes less than or equal to 2 minimum wages. Many of them know about the importance of wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) and the mandatory license for the use and purchase of agrochemicals. However, about 40% do not use PPE or use it inadequately and 28.9% do not have a license to purchase. More than 9% of participants reported cases of intoxication, however, less than 7% sought specialized care. Workers are aware of the risks that the use of agrochemicals expose them to risk situations, but this does not encourage them to change their worksite behavior.
