This article analyzes the effect of violence against women on their self-perception of health, based on the population of Brazilian women aged between 20 and 49 years of age, using data from the 2013 National Health Survey. The results indicate that more than 80% of women who suffered violence caused by an individual in the last 12 months prior to the survey, reported the most severe being psychological and/or physical aggression. The worst health reports were higher among women who reported violence suffered at the hands of a person known to them, in the case of residents in rural areas. With respect to residents of urban locations, there were reports of violence perpetrated by an unknown aggressor. Based on these results, it can be inferred that women who are victims of violence have a worse self-perception of health vis-Ã -vis those who were not victims of violence.
