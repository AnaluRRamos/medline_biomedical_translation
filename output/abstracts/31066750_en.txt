The study aimed to analyze the relationship between health, work characteristics, education, and skills on the work ability of teachers in basic education in Brazil. This was a cross-sectional, population-based study using data from the Brazilian National Survey on Health, Work Conditions, and Absences in Schoolteachers in Basic Education (Educatel Study). A probabilistic sample of 6,510 teachers answered a telephone interview in 2015 with questions on sociodemographic data, health status, education and skills, work characteristics, and absenteeism. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used in multivariate analysis and standardized coefficients (SC) were calculated to analyze direct and indirect effects between the outcomes. Health status showed a direct effect on work ability (SC = -0.83, p < 0.01). Work characteristics directly affected health status (SC = 0.60, p < 0.01) and work ability (SC = -0.25, p < 0.05), especially noise at work and students' unruliness. Total effect (sum of direct and indirect effects) of work characteristics on work ability was -0.75 (p < 0.01). The study concluded that the relations between health status and work characteristics of Brazilian teachers in basic education are complex and negatively affect work ability. Potential actions to promote and maintain work ability should take into account the psychosocial demands of teaching and measures to maintain order and discipline in the classroom.
