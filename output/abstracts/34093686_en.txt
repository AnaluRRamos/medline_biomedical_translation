The SAFARI technique or Subintimal Arterial Flossing with Antegrade-Retrograde Intervention is an endovascular procedure that allows recanalization of Chronic Total Occlusive (CTO) lesions when conventional subintimal angioplasty is unsuccessful. Retrograde access is usually obtained through the popliteal, anterior tibial, dorsalis pedis artery, or posterior tibial arteries and may potentially provide more options for endovascular interventions in limb salvage. The case of an 81-year-old man with a history of uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia is presented. He presented with a cutaneous ulcer on the right lower limb with torpid evolution and poor healing. The Doppler ultrasound and arteriographic study revealed a CTO lesion of the popliteal artery that was not a candidate for antegrade endovascular revascularization, but was successfully treated using the SAFARI technique. The patient had no perioperative complications, the wound showed better healing, and he was discharged with an indication of daily dressings and control by an external outpatient clinic.
