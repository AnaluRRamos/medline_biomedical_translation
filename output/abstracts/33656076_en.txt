The world changed in just a few months after the emergence of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a beta coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020. Brazil currently has the world’s second-highest COVID-19 death toll, second only to the USA. The COVID-19 pandemic is spreading fast in the world with more than 181 countries affected. This editorial refers to the article published in Arquivos Brasileiros de Cardiologia: “Increase in home deaths due to cardiorespiratory arrest in times of COVID-19 pandemic.”<sup>1</sup> Their main results show a gradual increase in the rate of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in the city of Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Their data demonstrate a proportional increase of 33% of home deaths in March 2020 compared to previous periods. Their study is the first Brazilian paper to demonstrate the same trend observed in other countries.
