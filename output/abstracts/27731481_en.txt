The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of replacing poorly fitting dentures on patient's masticatory function, satisfaction and oral health-related quality of life. Fourteen patients with conventional maxillary complete dentures and mandibular overdentures retained by two implants bar clip system had their dentures replaced. The laboratory tests for the analysis of masticatory performance were conducted using an 'Optocal' food simulator test. Questionnaires were used to evaluate patient satisfaction with dentures and impact of oral health on quality of life. Tests were conducted and questionnaires were administered before and 1, 3 and 6 months after the patient had adapted to the new dentures. Masticatory performance data and satisfaction with dentures (Visual Analogic Scale) were statistically analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey b test, satisfaction with dentures (SATs P) and impact of oral health on quality of life were evaluated using the Wilcoxon and Friedman tests (a=.05). There was no statistically significant improvement in masticatory function after denture replacement, although better outcomes were observed. Satisfaction with dentures and total score obtained using the OHIPedent showed significant improvement. It can be suggested that the potential for grinding food, patient satisfaction and aspects of quality of life improved immediately after denture replacement.
