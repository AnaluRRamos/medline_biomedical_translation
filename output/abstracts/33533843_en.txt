This study analyzes the behavior patterns related to the lifestyle of adolescents in Recife, Brazil. A cross-sectional study was conducted with data from the Cardiovascular Risk Study among Adolescents (ERICA) and 2400 students aged 12 to 17 were interviewed. The prevalence of physical activity, eating behavior, smoking and alcohol consumption were analyzed. The Chi-square test and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were used to evaluate the statistical significance of the measurements. It was observed that 60% of the adolescents presented inadequate eating behaviors regarding the consumption of breakfast, daily water intake and meals eaten in front of the TV. About 40% (95%CI: 39.7-45) did not sit down to meals with their parents or guardians. The prevalence of physical inactivity was 52.4% (95%CI: 50-55). Female adolescents were more inactive (68.7%, 95%CI: 65-72) than males (36.4%, 95%CI: 33-40). Teenagers of economic classes D and E were the most inactive (60.7%, 95%CI: 46-73). Alcohol consumption was 18.7% (95%CI: 2.6-5.6) and smoking was prevalent in 3.8% (95%CI: 2-6) of the individuals. Inadequate eating behaviors and physical inactivity were the main areas responsible for an unhealthy lifestyle, followed by alcohol consumption and smoking.
