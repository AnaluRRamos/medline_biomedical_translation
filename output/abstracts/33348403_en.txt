To verify the efficacy of short-term prophylaxis for vaginal or cesarean section childbirth with plasma-derived C1-inhibitor concentrate in pregnant women. They should have hereditary angioedema (HAE) and normal plasma C1-inhibitor.  Case report of pregnant women diagnosed with HAE with normal C1-inhibitor who had been treated with intravenous C1-inhibitor concentrate for prophylaxis of angioedema attacks when hospitalized for delivery. The exon 9 of the Factor 12 (<i>F12</i>) genotyping gene was performed by automatic sequencing in all patients.  Three cases of pregnant women with HAE with normal serum level of C1-inhibitor are reported. The genetic test detected the presence of a pathogenic mutation in the <i>F12</i> gene. Deliveries occurred uneventfully and patients had no HAE symptoms in the following 72 hours.  C1-inhibitor concentrate could be useful to prevent angioedema attacks during and after delivery.
