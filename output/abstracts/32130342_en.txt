This study aimed to investigate acute and chronic effects of varenicline on lung tissue in an experimental study. A total of 34 rats were randomly allocated into study (varenicline) and control groups. The rats were divided into two groups (i) control group, (ii) varenicline group. Then, the rats in the each group were sub-divided equally in turn as acute (C1; V1) and chronic (C2; V2) ; all rats of acute and chronic groups were sacrificed under the anesthesia on the 45th day for acute group [C1 (n=5) and V1 (n=12)] and the 90th day for chronic group [C2 (n=5) and V2 (n=12)], respectively. Thus, biochemical and histopathological analysis were carried out. Thirty four rats completed the study, 24 were in varenicline group and 10 were in control group. In chronic exposure to varenicline, oxidant levels comprising of malondialdehyde (MDA), and myeloperoxidase (MPO) increased and superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione (GSH) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) levels, named as antioxidants, decreased significantly when compared to the control group. MDA and MPO levels were also significantly higher and SOD, CAT, GPx, GSH levels were also significantly lower in chronic varenicline group when compared to acute varenicline group. These findings were also supported by histopathological observations. This is the first study, which evaluated pulmonary effects of varenicline experimentally on an animal model. It was observed that chronic varenicline treatments cause inflammation and lung cell injury.
