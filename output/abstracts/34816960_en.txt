The current study assessed the effect of contextual and individual determinants of the use of newborn hearing screening in Brazilian state capitals and the Federal District. The conceptual theoretical model proposed by Andersen & Davidson (2014) oriented the analyses using multilevel logistic modeling with data from the Brazilian National Health Survey, 2013. The study population (n = 585) is representative of 230,112 pairs of women/responsible person over 18 years of age and their respective children under 2 years of age. At the contextual level (state capitals and Federal District), the use of newborn hearing screening was determined by the proportion of extremely poor individuals (odds ratio - OR = 0.91; 95% confidence interval - 95%CI: 0.83-0.99) and by monthly coverage of newborn hearing screening (OR = 1.02; 95%CI: 1.01-1.02). At the individual level, use of newborn hearing screening was higher in the maternal age bracket 25 to 39 years, compared to < 25 years. The odds of use of newborn hearing screening were lower in mothers with brown race/color (OR = 0.47; 95%CI: 0.26-0.83) compared to white mothers. As for schooling, complete university education nearly tripled the odds of newborn hearing screening when compared to primary schooling (OR = 2.99; 95%CI: 1.15-7.79). Predominantly private prenatal care increased the odds of using newborn hearing screening by 2.18 times, compared to public prenatal care (OR = 2.18; 95%CI: 1.02-4.64). Effective enforcement of existing hearing health laws and policies and prioritization of primary healthcare and health education practices with a focus on more vulnerable newborns, based on the characteristics identified in this study, are initiatives that can help ensure an equitable social protection system.
