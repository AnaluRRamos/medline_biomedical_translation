Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder accompanied by behavioral and personality changes and/or language deterioration. Its behavioral variant (bvFTD) is the main clinical presentation. This study aims to investigate the treatment alternatives for bvFTD available so far. We conducted a narrative review of bvFTD treatment options. We used PubMed and Lilacs databases with the terms 'frontotemporal dementia' or 'behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia' combined with 'treatment,' 'pharmacological treatment,' or 'disease-modifying drugs.' The articles retrieved and selected in the research pointed out that there is no specific treatment approved for bvFTD so far. The current proposals are limited to handle the cardinal behavioral symptoms of the disorder. Disease-modifying drugs are under development and may be promising, especially in the monogenic presentations of FTD. There are numerous approaches to treat the core symptoms of bvFTD, most of them based on low-quality research. To date, there are no drugs with a disease-specific therapeutic recommendation for bvFTD. Treatments are often investigated guided by primary psychiatric disorders with similar symptoms and should be chosen by the predominant symptom profile.
