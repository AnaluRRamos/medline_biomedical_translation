This article aims to characterize the heavy drinking behavior in the Brazilian population, using data from the two editions of the 'National Health Survey' (PNS), 2013 and 2019. The sample sizes in 2013 and 2019 were 60,202 and 88,943 individuals aged 18 years or older, respectively. The prevalence of the habit of heavy drinking (defined as 8 or more doses per week for women, and 15 or more doses for men) was estimated, and the confidence intervals were defined by sex, age group, schooling, skin color/race, marital status and household status (urban/rural). Poisson regression models were used to compare prevalence rates. 6.1% of Brazilians were heavy drinkers in 2013, and 7.3% in 2019. In the two editions of the PNS there was a gradient of reduction in heavy drinking throughout life, being the highest prevalence among young adults, men, with low schooling, single and living in the urban area. The high prevalence rates expose the need to consider the habit of heavy drinking as a risk factor for the health of the Brazilian population, and the urgency to adopt strategies to reduce it.
