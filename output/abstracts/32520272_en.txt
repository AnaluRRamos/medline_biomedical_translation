The debate over marijuana regulation has gained strength in recent years, due to its therapeutic potential. Despite this, there is still a lot of prejudice related to the use of medical marijuana. In the mid-1990s, Lafepe proposed to produce a Cannabis sativa-based medicine. This proposal was pioneering at a time when the discussion about drugs was still surrounded by intense prohibitions and prejudice. This work aims to rescue, through an interview with Professor Antônio José Alves, President of Lafepe at the time, all the paths and obstacles taken in the avant-garde attempt to create the first marijuana-based medicine made in Brazil.
