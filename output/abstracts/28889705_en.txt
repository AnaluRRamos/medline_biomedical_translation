Endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) has significantly altered the therapeutic strategy for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), due to less invasiveness and lower perioperative morbi-mortality. However, specific complications such as persistent type 2 endoleak (pT2E, present > 6 months after EVAR) have been associated with adverse outcomes. However conflicting results from heterogeneous studies, failed to support an optimal threshold for intervention. The purpose of this study was to identify predictive factors associated with pT2E. The clinical data of the last 100 patients admitted for EVAR in our hospital until April 2016 were retrospec- tively reviewed. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS V.22. We analyzed 100 cases of EVAR, performed with a branched stentgraft for AAA or aorto-iliac aneurysms. Most cases (n=83) were performed electively but 17 were performed for ruptured AAA. No pre-operative inferior mesen- teric artery (IMA) coil embolization was performed. A pT2E was observed by Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) in 21 cases (21%). Univariate analysis of risk factors for pT2E revealed that the number of patent lumbar arteries, patent IMA, platelet antiaggregants, absence of thoracic aortic aneurysm, and ruptured AAA were risk factors for pT2E (p<0.05). Binary logistic regression concluded platelet antiaggregants and increasing number of patent lumbars were independent risk factors for pT2E (p<0.05). Recently, pT2E that persists over a long period of time following EVAR has been reported to be involved in aneurysm sac growth, open conversion and rupture. Identification of pT2E predictive factors is crucial to prevent compli- cations and to consider measures such as pre-operative IMA coil embolization. We identified the number of patent lumbar arteries, the presence of patent IMA, platelet antiaggregants, absence of thoracic aortic aneurysm and ruptured AAA as sta- tistically significant risk factors for pT2E (p<0.05).
