The mean duration of surgical admissions was constant (p = 0.449); the mean stay (3.8 days) was decreasing and significant (p <0.01); the mean cost (389.16 dollars) and mortality (1.63%) were increasing and significant (p <0.01). In subgroups of eye, thoracic, oncological and other surgeries, the temporal evolution of surgeries was increasing and significant (p <0.05). In contrast, endocrine glands, digestive tract, genitourinary, breast, reconstruction and buco-maxillofacial surgeries showed a significant trend of decline (p <0.05).
