The relationships between philanthropy, government, and scientific knowledge are analyzed through the experience of Helena Antipoff at the Sociedade Pestalozzi of Minas Gerais. In the first half of the twentieth century, this institution spearheaded welfare initiatives for 'abnormal' children. Support for disabled people, the work of the Medical Education Office, the creation of an association for the care of newsboys, and the activities of the Pestalozzi Institute and Fazenda do Ros√°rio farm are examples of partnerships between the authorities and philanthropic organizations. Today, Sociedade Pestalozzi is strongly associated with the identity of its founder. Educated in Europe, at Institut Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Helena Antipoff conciliated philanthropy and science for the good of the 'abnormal.'
