To assess access to the Family Health Strategy (FHS) in Santo Ant√¥nio de Jesus - Brazil from the perspective of its users. Cross-sectional study conducted with a representative sample of users registered by 21 family healthcare teams of the municipality, for a total of 430 questionnaires. A family-based survey was applied between December 2012 and January 2013. Indicators considered as the most powerful to evaluate access were selected and, subsequently, divided into two dimensions: knowledge and evaluation of the Family Health Strategy Program from the perspective of its users. The results point to decreasing barriers and increasing access to healthcare services, as well as to a greater organization of enrollment in the system. Changes observed after the implementation of the FHS in the districts are evident in the overall satisfaction with the primary health care service, which legitimizes the organization of the health system based on primary comprehensive care.
