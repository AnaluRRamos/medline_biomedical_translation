The variation of clinical practice is a well-described phenomenon in which patients with similar diagnoses, prognoses and demographic status receive different levels of care depending on when, where and by whom they are treated, despite agreed and documented evidence of best practice. The overutilization of health resources is also known to have a negative risk-benefit ratio. Unfortunately, both phenomena occur in several countries, especially in developed countries. In the light of this, the American Board of Internal Medicine launched the Choosing Wisely campaign, which has subsequently been implemented in several countries, including Portugal.
