The aim of this study was to assess the occurrence of selfreported dentin hypersensitivity (DH) and its risk indicators in adolescents from a southern Brazilian city. 736 students (1519 years old) were randomly selected from 20 public and private schools in the city of Passo Fundo, Brazil. DH was assessed through the answers on a Likert scale to the question: 'Do you have tooth sensitivity?'.Participants underwent a clinical examination in which present teeth were counted, and answered an interview based on a structured questionnaire on sociode mographic information, history of dental bleaching, orthodontic treatment and oral health habits. The dependent variable (DH) was dichotomized at the point where hypersen sitivity occurs fairly often or always. Data were analyzed by multivariable logistic regression, including demographic, health history, socioeconomic and behavioral variables. Results: 556 (75.5%) subjects reported having sensitive teeth never, rarely or sometimes, while 180 (24.5%) reported having sensitive teeth fairly often or always. In the final model, number of present teeth, age, skin color, flossing, smoking, bleaching and orthodontic history were not associated with selfreported DH. Females showed significantly greater chance of having DH than males [odds ratio (OR)=1.91; 95% confidence interval (95%CI) 1.342.72]. The likelihood of DH in students at public schools was 63% higher than in those at private schools (OR=1.63 95%, CI 1.012.75). DH is a common perception among adolescents and is associated with female gender and studying at public schools.
