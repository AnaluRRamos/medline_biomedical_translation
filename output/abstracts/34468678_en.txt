The scope of this article is to describe the association between BMI variation, eating patterns and physical activity among adults between 21 and 44 years of age from 2007 to 2012. It is a cross-sectional study using the VIGITEL database. Eating patterns were identified with Principal Components Analysis for the period from 2007 to 2012. Components with eigenvalues >1.0 were retained and factor loadings greater than |0.3| were highlighted. For each individual, a score was calculated per pattern. The Body Mass Index (ΔBMI) difference variable was then created. Linear regression with ΔBMI outcome and Poisson regression with obesity outcomes were conducted. Four eating patterns were retained: Prudent, Transition, Western and Traditional. After multivariate adjustment, ΔBMI was inversely associated with the habit of leisure-time physical activity. Obesity revealed a positive association with the Western pattern, watching television ≥3 hours a day and physical inactivity. Obesity was inversely associated with the Prudent pattern, the Traditional pattern, the practice of leisure-time physical activity and the habit of physical activity at work. Eating patterns based on unprocessed and minimally processed foods and practice of physical activity are protective factors against obesity.
