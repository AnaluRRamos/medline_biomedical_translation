Exercise training (ET) is an important tool in the management of patients with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). The objective of this article was to discuss the effects of ET on the calf pump, functional parameters, and quality of life of patients with mild and advanced CVI. A systematic review was conducted and eleven studies were included. In patients with mild CVI, ET was effective for improving venous reflux, muscle strength, ankle range of motion, and quality of life. In advanced CVI patients, ET increased ejection fraction, reduced residual volume fraction, and improved muscle strength and ankle range of motion, but did not change venous reflux indices or quality of life. It is concluded that ET is effective for improving calf pump function, muscle strength, and ankle range of motion in CVI. In patients with mild CVI, additional benefits were observed in quality of life.
