To describe the process of Endemic Disease Control Worker (EDCW) integration into the Family Health Strategy. This was a descriptive cross-sectional study. Data were collected through a self-administered semi-structured questionnaire, from February to May 2017, in four Family Health centers in the urban region of Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. 57 Community Health Agents (CHW) and eight EDCWs participated. All participants reported providing guidance to property dwellers and 58 carried out mechanical vector control during the inspection of properties, in order to avoid and eliminate possible Aedes aegypti breeding sites. With regard to EDCW integration in the Family Health Strategy, 18 participants highlighted teamwork as a positive aspect; while 15 highlighted lack of autonomy to undertake legal interventions as a negative aspect. EDCW integration in the Family Health Strategy is feasible, however, adjustments need to be made to optimize activities within the perspective of shared work in the same territorial area.
