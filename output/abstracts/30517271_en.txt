To analyze the relations among the knowledge of teachers about hearing loss degree, technological devices, hearing aids (HA), cochlear implant (CI), frequency modulation system (FM), and communication strategies. Forty-two (42) teachers that taught students with hearing impairment participated in this study. This sample included 24 middle school teachers, 11 elementary school teachers, and 7 preschool teachers, whose taught in the second semester of the school year and in the first semester of the following year. The data was obtained through the Knowledge and Experience Questionnaire developed by Delgado-Pinheiro & Omote (2010). The questionnaire answers were categorized, and the frequency of occurrence was analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed using the chi-square test. There was a statistically significant difference between the answers which showed that the teachers do not know about the degree of hearing loss, but they modify the communication strategies to keep the attention of the students. In addition, the results also showed that teachers do not know the technological devices and communication strategies most appropriate for the student with hearing impairment. The results showed that teachers do not have sufficient knowledge about hearing impairment and as a result they modify their communication strategies for the student, even though they are unaware of the most appropriate communication strategies.
