The aim of the present examiner-blind randomized controlled clinical study was to compare the efficacy two soft-bristle toothbrushes in terms of plaque removal. Seventy volunteers were randomly allocated to Group A (tapered-tip toothbrush) or Group B (end-rounded toothbrush). At baseline appointment (Day 0), volunteers underwent plaque examination using the Improved Plaque Identification Index. Under supervision, they brushed their teeth for 1 minute with their assigned toothbrushes and the plaque examination was repeated. Volunteers continued the oral hygiene regimen (assigned toothbrush and a regular dentifrice provided by the researchers) for 7 days. The experimental procedures of Day 0 were then repeated. Separate statistical analyses were performed for mean percent reduction of plaque in the whole-mouth, interproximal and gumline scores at both times, using Mann-Whitney test, p<0.05. After a single toothbrushing, on Day 0, mean percent plaque was significantly reduced in both groups (p<0.05), with statistically greater reductions of whole-mouth (21.39±12.44 vs. 11.40±11.17), gumline (6.32±7.37 vs. 2.89±4.57) and interproximal (10.82±10.49 vs. 5.21±7.68) for Group A as compared to Group B. However, on day 7, no significant difference was observed between groups for whole-mouth (29.94±20.91 vs. 26.58±18.64), gumline (14.04±18.82 vs. 13.78±17.63) and interproximal surfaces (26.41±22.77 vs. 23.12±20.98) (p>0.05). In conclusion, on Day 0, Group A presented higher efficacy in supragingival plaque removal than Group B, as reflected by whole-mouth, gumline and interproximal plaque scores.
