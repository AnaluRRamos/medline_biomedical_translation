Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine-metabolic disease in women in reproductive age, and occurs in one of 10 women. The disease includes menstrual irregularity and excess of male hormones and is the most common cause of female infertility. Dyspnea is a frequent symptom and is often thought to be due to obesity, and whether it is due to cardiac dysfunction is unknown. To evaluate right ventricle-pulmonary artery (RV-PA) coupling and pulmonary arterial stiffness in patients with PCOS. 44 PCOS patients and 60 controls were included; venous blood samples were taken for laboratory tests and 2-D, m-mode and tissue doppler transthoracic echocardiography were performed for all the participants. P<0,05 was considered as statistically significant. When compared to the control group, PCOS patients had higher pulmonary artery stiffness values (p=0,001), which were positively correlated with HOMA-IR (r=0,545 and p<0,001). RV-PA coupling was also impaired in 34% of the study patients. Pulmonary artery stiffness is increased and RV-PA coupling is impaired in patients with PCOS. (Arq Bras Cardiol. 2021; 116(4):806-811)
