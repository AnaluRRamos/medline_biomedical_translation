The objective was to understand and analyze the experiences of Afro-Brazilian women regarding pregnancy, delivery and postpartum care. It involves empirical research, with a qualitative approach. Women were interviewed who declared themselves black or colored and were attended in the public health services in the municipalities of the State of Pernambuco. The narratives were collected through semi-structured interviews. The Content Analysis technique was used. The narratives addressed the issues of obstetric violence and institutional racism. The intersection of levels of oppression such as race, class and gender are determinant in interventions and abusive practices in the helathcare that involves childbirth. The conclusion drawn is that structural racism hinders and denies access to black women to their reproductive rights.
