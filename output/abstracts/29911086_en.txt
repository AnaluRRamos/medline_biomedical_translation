The aim of this study was to describe the strategies adopted in this institution to diagnose and treat patients with benign tumors affecting the median nerve. A retrospective chart review study of all patients operated on between 2010 and 2015. Histology, symptoms, complementary exams, surgical techniques performed, and demographic characteristics were analyzed. Fifty-four patients were included in the study. There were three neurofibromas, six schwannomas, 15 lipofibromatous hamartomas, three hemangiomas, 12 lipomas, one benign fibrohistiocytoma, and 14 synovial cysts. Complete tumoral resection was performed in 32 cases, partial resection in five, segmented nerve resection in one, nerve decompression in eight, and amputation for macrodactyly in eight. The most important recommendations on treating benign tumors of the median nerve are related to the clinical symptoms, tumoral growth, and tumoral nature. The surgical approach resulted in good function for 60% of the patients. However, lipofibromatous hamartomas, hemangiomas, and neurofibromas were associated with preoperative functional deficit. It may be inferred that the diagnosis and treatment of these tumors should be performed earlier.
