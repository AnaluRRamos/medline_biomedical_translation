Data on the use of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) on children in Brazil is lacking. This study sought to provide information on current pediatric CMR practices in Brazil. A questionnaire was sent out to referring physicians around the country. It covered information on the respondents, their CMR practices, the clinical context of the patients, and barriers to CMR use among children. For statistical analysis, two-sided p < 0.05 was considered significant. The survey received 142 replies. CMR was reported to be available to 79% of the respondents, of whom, 52% rarely or never use CMR. The most common indications were found to be cardiomyopathies (84%), status of post-tetralogy of Fallot repair (81%), and aortic arch malformations (53%). Exam complexity correlated with CMR-to-surgery ratio (Rho = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.32-0.62, p < 0.0001) and with the number of CMR exams (Rho = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.38-0.64, p < 0.0001). Further, a high CMR complexity score was associated with pediatric cardiologists conducting the exams (OR 2.14, 95% CI 1.2-3.89, p < 0.01). The main barriers to a more frequent use of CMR were its high cost (65%), the need for sedation (60%), and an insufficient number of qualified professionals (55%). Pediatric CMR is not used frequently in Brazil. The presence of a pediatric cardiologist who can perform CMR exams is associated with CMR use on more complex patients. Training pediatric CMR specialists and educating referring providers are important steps toward a broader use of CMR in Brazil. (Arq Bras Cardiol. 2021; 116(2):305-312)
