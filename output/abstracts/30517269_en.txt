To verify the perception of patients with neurodegenerative diseases regarding swallowing changes and to know the perceptions of swallowing sensations that can promote the early identification of dysphagia. It is a cross-sectional study with 44 patients with neurodegenerative diseases. All of them answered a questionnaire to know the sensation perceived during swallowing and its intensity. The Fatigue Severity Scale was applied to measure fatigue and the Swallowing Disturbance Questionnaire was applied to detect swallowing complaints. The Functional Oral Intake Scale was used to classify the swallowing functionality. Videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) was performed to verify the correspondence between the patient's perceptions and swallowing physiopathology. A descriptive and exploratory statistical analysis was performed. There was correspondence between VFSS findings and the patient's perception in 76.5% of the cases. Sensations such as discomfort and fatigue were perceived during swallowing, especially with solids. Such feelings have predominantly been reported in the throat, from the half to the end of the meal. There was association between fatigue and odynophagia. Fatigue during swallowing was associated with worse functionality of oral intake. Most participants perceived the disorders in their swallowing. Sensations such as burning, discomfort, tiredness, pain, cramp, or irritation were perceived by participants and were associated with symptoms that may suggest risk of aspiration due to fatigue resulting from weakness, incoordination, and/or stiffness of muscles.
