Vulvar carcinoma is an uncommon tumor that predominantly affects postmenopausal women. Currently, there is no screening procedure for vulvar carcinoma; in most cases, it is diagnosed only when symptoms appear. The most widely used staging system is that developed by the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics. Lymph node status is the most important prognostic factor. We searched the PubMed/Medline database to identify relevant English-language articles on vulvar cancer, with a special focus on its imaging evaluation. Magnetic resonance imaging is useful for local and nodal staging, as well as facilitating the planning of surgical interventions and radiotherapy. Computed tomography or positron-emission tomography/computed tomography can play an important role in nodal and distant disease assessment, whereas ultrasound is often used for image-guided biopsies. Imaging is pivotal for staging and treatment planning in vulvar carcinoma.
