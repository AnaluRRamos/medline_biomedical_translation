To validate the evaluation questionnaire on adherence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients under hemodialysis. We verified the following psychometric properties of the instrument: reliability (stability and internal consistency) and validity (face, content, and construct). The intraclass correlation coefficient reached a value of 0.98 for the adherence questions and 0.91 for the perception questions. Regarding the kappa of the 14 questions examined, 12 had a value > 0.8, whereas the Cronbach's alpha had a value of 0.57. Experts ensured the face and content validity of the instrument, giving it an overall content validity index of 0.96. Construct validity, analyzed by Mann-Whitney test, was achieved as all domains showed a significant association with p<0.01. We verified, by the presented results, that the instrument has been validated for use in Brazil.
