The use of dental prosthesis and the tooth loss in elderly people are associated with significant impact on the overall health and quality of life. Continuous assessment of oral health profile in this population is important for planning the actions and policies of the area. The aims of this study were to assess the prevalence of tooth loss and use of dental prosthesis among the elderly people in different periods, to evaluate the association between functional dentition (20 teeth or more) and socioeconomic factors, and to evaluate the impact of tooth loss and use of dental prosthesis on self-rated oral health. Thesample consisted of people aged 60 years and older who participated in the Health, Well-Being, and Aging Study (SABE). Data from the years 2000, 2006, and 2010 were used to assess the prevalence of tooth loss and use of dental prosthesis. Analysis of the factors associated with the functional dentition and self-rated oral health was based on the data collected in 2010. Comparison of oral health profile over the 3 years was done through descriptive analysis and comparison of confidence intervals. Multiple logistic regression models were used to assess the factors associated with functional dentition and self-rated oral health. The prevalence of tooth loss and use of dental prosthesis remained constant over the three periods analyzed. Functional dentition was significantly associated with education, sex, and race/gender. Individuals in need of dental prosthesis and with periodontal pocket were more likely to report poor oral health. There was no reduction in the prevalence of tooth loss and in the use of dental prosthesis over 10 years. Functional dentition is associated with socioeconomic inequalities. Self-rated oral health is associated with the need of dental prosthesis.
