The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of spatial resolution (line pairs per millimetre - lp/mm) on the diagnosis of simulated external root resorption (ERR) in multi-rooted teeth by using digital periapical radiography. Forty human mandibular molars (80 roots) were used. The roots were divided into the following groups (n = 10): control without root filling (WORF), control with root filling (WRF), small ERRWORF, small ERR-WRF, moderate ERR-WORF, moderate ERR-WRF, extensive ERR-WORF and extensive ERR-WRF. Four digital radiographs (phosphor storage plates - PSP system) were taken of each tooth in three angulations. The PSPs were scanned with 10, 20, 25 and 40 lp/mm. All images were assessed by three endodontists who used a five-point scale for presence and absence of ERR and classified its location (cervical, middle or apical third). ROC curves and one-way ANOVA were performed (p < 0.01). Diagnosis of ERR in nonroot-filled teeth showed higher values of sensitivity for 20 lp/mm and higher values of both specificity and accuracy for 40 lp/mm. In root-filled teeth, sensitivity and accuracy were higher for 25 lp/mm and spatial resolution had no influence on specificity. The best resolution for diagnosis of small and extensive ERR was 25 lp/mm, whereas for moderate ERR, it was 40 lp/mm. Cervical ERR was the most difficult to diagnose, regardless of the spatial resolution. Higher spatial resolutions have improved the radiographic diagnosis of simulated ERR in multi-rooted teeth and this should be considered when performing digital radiographs.
