This was a reflective theoretical essay that was based on the national and international literature. The goal was to analyze the interfaces and historical-conceptual distinctions between permanent education in health and interprofessional education in health. In the international context, there have been educational movements aimed at health workers with an emphasis on the incentives of the Pan-American Health Organization. In Brazil, both proposals highlight a commitment to the quality of practice in the Unified Health System, focused on health needs, with approaches that have a lot in common. Permanent education in health is geared toward on-the-job training to transform work processes, with the objective of delivering comprehensive care. Interprofessional education in health involves shared interactive learning of collaborative skills for effective teamwork, guided by interprofessional collaboration. The purpose of both is to qualify health practices through the education of workers in groups; however it is essential to distinguish the theoretical, conceptual, and methodological frameworks that support them.
