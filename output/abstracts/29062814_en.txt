It has been advocated that total hip arthroplasty (THA) is probably the most successful surgical intervention performed in Medicine. In the 1960s, Sir John Charnley not only introduced, but also modified and improved the technique of cemented arthroplasties.

This article is a brief update on the main aspects of THA.
