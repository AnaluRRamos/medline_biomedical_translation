To measure the scattered radiation dose at different positions simulating hip surgery. We simulated fluoroscopy-assisted hip surgery in order to study the distribution of scattered radiation in the operating room. To simulate the patient, we used a anthropomorphic whole-body phantom, and we used an X-ray-specific detector to quantify the radiation. Radiographs were obtained with a mobile C-arm X-ray system in continuous scan mode, with the tube at 0º (configuration 1) or 90º (configuration 2). The operating parameters employed (voltage, current, and exposure time) were determined by a statistical analysis based on the observation of orthopedic surgical procedures involving the hip. For all measurements, higher exposures were observed in configuration 2. In the measurements obtained as a function of height, the maximum dose rates observed were 1.167 (± 0.023) µSv/s and 2.278 (± 0.023) µSv/s in configurations 1 and 2, respectively, corresponding to the chest level of health care professionals within the operating room. Proximal to the patient, the maximum values were recorded in the position occupied by the surgeon. We can conclude that, in the scenario under study, health care professionals workers are exposed to low levels of radiation, and that those levels can be reduced through the use of personal protective equipment.
