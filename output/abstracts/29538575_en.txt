This study aimed to investigate factors associated with the treatment adherence of 150 elderly diabetics assisted in gerontogeriatric outpatient service in northeastern Brazil. Full adherence to therapy was self-reported by 27.3% of the elderly. In the bivariate analysis, adherence was associated with self-perceived health, beliefs in the use of medication, understanding explanations about diabetes and professional responsible for treatment guidance. After analysis adjustment, only beliefs in medicine were significant when comparing non-adherence with full adherence (OR = 9.65; CI95% 1.6; 56.6) and non-adherence with partial adherence (OR = 18.15; CI95% 3.5;95.4). It can be concluded that full adherence to diabetes treatment is low and is associated with beliefs in medications for disease control. It is necessary to develop additional studies to better define the role of health beliefs and practices of care among elderly assisted in primary health care.
