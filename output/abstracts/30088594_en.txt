To identify the factors associated with the self-application of insulin in adult individuals with Diabetes Mellitus. A cross-sectional study developed in the city of Vi√ßosa-MG, which assessed 142 patients. The data collection was performed between April and July 2013 through an interview at the participant's home. Multiple logistic regression was used. The prevalence of the self-administration of insulin was of 67.6%, and it was associated with ages between 57 and 68 years old (OR = 0.3, 95% CI: 0.1-0.9), living with a partner and children (OR = 2.5, 95% CI: 1.1-5.0), 9 years or more of study (OR = 8.4, 95% CI: 1.9-37.9), living in an area not covered by the Family Health Strategy (FHS) (OR = 2.8, 95% CI: 1.1 - 7.0). The self-application of insulin was associated with age, schooling, marital status, and the FHS coverage. The recognition of these factors may contribute to the adherence to the self-application of insulin.
