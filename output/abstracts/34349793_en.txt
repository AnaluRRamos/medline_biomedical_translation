Chronic ulcerations of the lower extremities are quite a common condition amongst adults, most often caused by chronic venous insufficiency. Irrespective of the main underlying cause, chronic limb ulcerations are usually associated with significant symptoms, impairing daily functioning. Improper or delayed diagnosis and inadequate treatment increase the risk of serious complications, including limb amputations. Malignancies can develop secondary to chronic leg ulcers. About 2.4% of ulcers arising from chronic venous stasis undergo malignant transformation. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of malignancy found in chronic leg ulceration biopsies. Basal cell carcinoma, sarcoma, and melanoma have all been documented infrequently. In the case described here, we found lymphoma of the marginal zone of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), which is an extremely rare cutaneous neoplasm of the lower extremities, but one that may have an association with autoimmune diseases.
