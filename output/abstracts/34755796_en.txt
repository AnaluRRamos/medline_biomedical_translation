To characterize the clinical-epidemiological profile of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children temporally associated with COVID-19 (MIS-C), and to identify factors associated with MIS-C deaths in Brazil, 2020. This was a cross-sectional study, using national MIS-C monitoring data. Logistical regression was performed to estimate crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR). Median case (n=652) age was 5 years, 57.1% were male, 52.0% were of brown race/skin color and 6.4% died. Likelihood of death was greater among those who presented O2 saturation <95% (ORa=4.35 - 95%CI 1.69;11.20) and altered urea results (ORa=5.18 - 95%CI 1.91;14.04); likelihood of death was lower when red skin blotches were not present (ORa=0.23 - 95%CI 0.09;0.62), when anticoagulants were used (ORa=0.32 - 95%CI 0.12;0.89) and when immunoglobulins were used (ORa=0.38 - 95%CI 0.15;1.01). Fatality ratios were higher among cases that presented O2 saturation <95% and altered urea results. Fatality ratios were lower among those with red skin blotches, and those who used immunoglobulins and anticoagulants.
