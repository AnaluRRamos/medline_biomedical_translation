This article aims to monitor the indicators of outpatient production of Dentistry and to evaluate the association of collective action and extraction indicators with the number of Oral Health Teams (OHT) between 2006 and 2015 in Paraná. In this longitudinal ecological study, consolidated secondary data were analyzed (collective actions of supervised brushing-SB, topical application of fluoride-TAF, fluoride mouthwash-FM, oral examination for epidemiological purposes-OE and extractions of permanent teeth-EX) from the Ambulatory Information System (SIA-SUS) and OHT numbers from the National Registry System of Health Establishments. Descriptive analyzes and Pearson's correlation were performed, with significance level of p<0.05. It was verified the increase of the OHT implantation over time and a strong positive correlation with collective procedures of SB (r=0.78; p=0.007) and FM (r=0.76; p=0.011) and moderate negative correlation with EX (r=-0.53). It was concluded that the evaluated indicators showed that the implementation of Oral Health Teams may have contributed to changes to the healthcare model, with an increase in preventive collective procedures and reduction of tooth loss in Paraná.
