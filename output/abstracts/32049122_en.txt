This study sought to update knowledge on unsafe abortion in Brazil. We carried out a systematic review with study search and selection on MEDLINE and LILACS, with no language restriction, from 2008 to 2018. We evaluated article quality using the Joanna Briggs Institute instruments. We evaluated 50 articles. The prevalence of induced abortion in Brazil was estimated by a direct method to be 15% in 2010 and 13% in 2016. Higher prevalences were observed in more socially vulnerable populations. There was a decrease in the ratio of induced abortions by 1,000 women of reproductive age in the period 1995-2013, reaching 16 per 1,000 in 2013. Half of all women reported using medications for terminating pregnancies and the number of hospital admissions due to complications from abortion, especially severe complications, decreased from 1992 to 2009. Maternal morbimortality from abortion had a reduced frequency but reached high values in specific contexts. It is likely that maternal deaths from abortion are under-reported. Common mental disorders during pregnancy and postpartum depression were more frequent among women who unsuccessfully attempted to induce an abortion. Findings indicate that abortion is frequently used in Brazil, especially in less-developed regions and by more socially-vulnerable women. Access to safer methods probably contributed to the reduction in hospitalizations due to complications and to the reduction in morbimortality from abortion. However, half of all women still resort to other methods and the number of admissions due to complications from abortion is still high.
