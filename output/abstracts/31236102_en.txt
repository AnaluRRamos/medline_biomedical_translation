The treatment options for aberrant right subclavian artery vary depending on the presence of Kommerell's diverticulum. Because there is a tendency not to report mortalities of these rare cases in the literature, it is hard to reach a conclusion on treatments from the limited data on post-interventional results in these patients. We report our experience with a 67-year old patient with an aberrant right subclavian aneurysm with Kommerell's diverticulum, diagnosed by chance.
