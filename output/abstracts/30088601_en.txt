To analyze the specialized literature regarding the risk factors in nursing diagnosis for suicide risks in elderly. This is an integrative literature review carried out during June 2015 in the following databases with no time limit: MEDLINE, PsycINFO and CINAHL. A total of 80 full papers were analyzed. It was suggested the inclusion of 23 risk factors in NANDA-I taxonomy: apathy; unrest; low self esteem; carelessness with medication; Inability to ask for help; Inability to express feelings; suicidal plan; rigidity; functional disability; visual problems; sadness; hostility; anxiety; failure; frustration; unhappiness; dishonor; frequent visits to a physician with unclear symptoms; social deprivation; social devaluation; psychological violence; Interfamilial violence; and financial violence. The risks for suicide presented in NANDA-I taxonomy need to be refined and adapted to the elderly reality. Furthermore, a review is also recommended for the risk factors not included in this classification.
