To analyze social inequalities in the prevalence of indicators of active aging in the Brazilian older adult population. This is a cross-sectional study with a sample of 11,177 older adults who participated in the Brazilian National Health Survey in 2013. We estimated the prevalence of five domains of active aging (social activities, civic engagement, leisure-time physical activity, paid work, and volunteer work) according to gender, ethnicity, schooling, income, and private health insurance. Prevalence ratios and confidence intervals were calculated using Poisson regression. The percentage of involvement in organized social activities, civic engagement, and physical activity was 25.1, 12.4, and 13.1%, respectively. Regarding work, 20.7% of the sample had a paid job, and 9.7% participated in volunteer work. Women had a higher prevalence of participation in organized social activities and volunteer work; while civic engagement and paid work were more frequent among men. White people were more likely to participate in social activities, volunteer work, and leisure-time physical activity, explained by their schooling. The strata with a higher level of schooling, income, and who had private health insurance showed a greater incidence of participation in all activities studied. The five activities analyzed are challenging for the proposed policy of active aging, as they are marked by considerable social inequality.
