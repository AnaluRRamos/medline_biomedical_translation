The authors report a case of a 48 year-old female patient with moderate abdominal pain and bulging in the abdomen. Physical examination demonstrated the presence of a palpable abdominal mass. Computed tomography showed a heterogeneously enhancing retroperitoneal mass in close contact with the inferior vena cava. En bloc resection of the mass and of the attached vena cava segment was performed. Histological analysis revealed leiomyosarcoma.
