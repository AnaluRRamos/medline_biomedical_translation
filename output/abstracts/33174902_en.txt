The proportions of teams performing actions to address NCDs were compared between PMAQ-AB cycles I and II using the McNemar test for paired samples. Seventeen of the 20 variables studied showed a proportional increase between the two cycles: from 16.0% to 32.1% of teams that practiced all care management actions, from 21.5% to 35.2% of those that practiced all health promotion actions and from 22.2% to 39.8% of teams that practiced all activities at school. PHC actions to address NCDs in Goiás were strengthened between the two PMAQ-AB cycles.
