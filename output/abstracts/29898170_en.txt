To evaluate the musculoskeletal discomfort, work ability and residual fatigue in nursing professionals working in the hospital setting. Cross-sectional study with professionals from a medium-sized public hospital. The Nordic symptom questionnaire, the work ability index, and the need for recovery scale (fatigue) were used. Data were analyzed descriptively and inferential tests were applied in order to verify the association of fatigue and work ability, and compare the fatigue among sectors analyzed. Participation of 110 professionals in the study. A total of 86.24% of workers reported musculoskeletal discomfort, with a higher prevalence in the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine. Approximately 43% of professionals presented residual fatigue. There was a significant association between fatigue and reduction of work ability (p<0.003), as well as association between younger age and greater fatigue (p<0.03). Results demonstrated a high prevalence of musculoskeletal discomfort in the previous year and a considerable number of professionals with residual fatigue. There was a substantial portion of workers with moderate work ability and requiring attention in the medium term.
