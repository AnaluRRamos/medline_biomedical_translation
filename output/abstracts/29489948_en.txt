This study aimed to assess the effect of the expansion of the Family Health Strategy (FHS) on hospitalizations for primary care sensitive conditions (PCSCs) in children under one year of age. This was a longitudinal ecological study with the use of panel data, for which the analytical units were the 417 municipalities (counties) in Bahia State, Brazil, from 2000 to 2012. Data were obtained from the official health information systems. The hospitalization rate for PCSCs was the outcome and FHS coverage was the principal exposure. The co-variables referred to demographic and socioeconomic characteristics and the local availability of pediatric beds. Bivariate and multivariate panel data analyses were performed, with negative binomial response and fixed effects models, using crude and adjusted relative risk (RR) as the measure of association, with the respective confidence intervals. To control for trend effect, the models were adjusted for time. From 2000 to 2012, 248,944 hospitalizations for PCSCs were recorded in children under one year, and the median municipal rate of hospitalizations for PCSCs decreased by 52.5% during the period, ranging from 96.9 to 46.0 avoidable hospitalizations per 1,000 live births. After adjusting the model, the reduction in avoidable hospitalizations was maintained at the different FHS coverage levels. This study demonstrated the effects of the consolidation of the FHS on hospitalizations for PCSCs in infants, which indicates the importance of strengthening primary care measures in order to offer case-resolving care during the first contact with the health system and avoid unnecessary hospitalizations.
