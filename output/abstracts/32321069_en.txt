The present study aimed to translate and cross-culturally adapt the Physical Function in ICU Test-scored (PFIT-s) and the De Morton Mobility Index (DEMMI) to Brazilian Portuguese. This study consisted of the translation, synthesis, and back-translation of the original versions of the PFIT-s and DEMMI, including revision by the Translation Group and pretesting of the translated version, assessed by an Expert Committee. The Brazilian versions of these instruments were applied to 60 cooperative patients with at least 48 h of mechanical ventilation at ICU discharge. The interrater reliability of both scales was tested using the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC). The authors of both original scales have approved the cross-culturally validated versions. Translation and back-translation attained consensus, and no item was changed. Both scales showed good interrater reliability (ICC>0.80) and internal consistency (Î±>0.80). The versions of the PFIT-s and DEMMI adapted to Brazilian Portuguese proved to be easy to understand and apply clinically in the ICU environment.
