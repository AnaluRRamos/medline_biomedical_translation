The goal was to adapt the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) to the US Dietary Guidelines for Brazilian children. Cross-sectional study conducted in a population-based sample of 1185 children 13-35 months old of São Luís municipality (MA). A 24-hour dietary recall Survey measured the food consumption and set the intrapersonal variance diet. We evaluated the construct validity by Principal Component Analysis and the Pearson correlation coefficient to see whether the index measures the quality of independent dietary energy consumed. We evaluated the reliability for the analysis of internal consistency, by calculating the alpha coefficient Conbrach and the correlations between each component and the total score. The correlations between the scores of components and energy were low (r ≤ 0.29). Four factors with eigenvalues > 1 were retained with cumulative variance of 58%. Cronbach's alpha was 0.48. The variety of the diet (r = 0.77) and vegetables and legumes (r = 0.60) had higher positive correlations with the total score (p < 0.05). The average of the HEI was 74.8 (± 13.2) points to 58.7% of children with diets that needed improvement. The adapted HEI proved to be valid to assess the overall quality of the diet of children.
