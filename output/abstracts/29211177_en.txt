The study aimed to identify the severity of malocclusions and associated factors among Brazilian adolescents. Data from 5,445 adolescents participating in the Brazilian Oral Health Survey (SBBrasil 2010) were evaluated, of which 4,276 were included in the study based on the inclusion criteria. The dependent variable was severe and very severe malocclusion, according to the Dental Aesthetic Index (DAI > 30). The independent variables were place of residence, macro-region, self-reported ethnicity, income, gender, schooling, access to dental care, untreated caries and front and back teeth loss due to caries. A hierarchical multiple logistical regression analysis was performed, considering the complex cluster sampling plan. Prevalence of severe/very severe malocclusions was 17.5%. After adjustments, black/brown ethnicity group (OR = 1.59, 95% CI: 1.09-2.34), lower household income (OR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.55-0-82), front (OR = 2.32, 95% CI: 1.14-4.76) and back teeth (OR = 1.45, 95% CI: 1.14-1.84) loss due to caries were associated with the outcome. Therefore, we conclude that black/brown ethnicity, lower household income and greater number of front and back teeth loss due to caries increased the odds for severe/very severe malocclusion.
