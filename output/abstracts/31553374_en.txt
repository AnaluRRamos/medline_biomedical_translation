To evaluate the effect of isolated and combined warm shower bath and perineal exercise with Swiss ball, on perception of pain, anxiety and labor progression. Randomized, controlled clinical trial with 128 patients allocated into three groups of therapies: isolated and combined bath and ball. Pain and anxiety perception was evaluated before and thirty minutes after therapeutic intervention through visual analogic scales (VAS). Pain perception score increased, and anxiety decreased in all groups, mainly when using a shower bath. The cervical dilation increased in all groups (p<.001), as well as the number of uterine contractions increased, mainly in the group that used combined bath and ball and also showed shorter labor time. The studied therapies contribute to maternal adaptation and well-being and favor labor's evolution.
