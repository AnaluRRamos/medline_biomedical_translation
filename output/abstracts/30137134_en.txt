This article describes the elements present in medical practice that contribute to understand its acknowledged low adhesion to the guidelines set forth by the Brazilian Primary Health Care (PHC) Policy. The empirical material produced by the two investigations of a qualitative nature led by the research team were put into use. In the first, in interviews involving managers and social control in cities the State of São Paulo, Brazil, physicians (acknowledged as central professionals for the construction of the Brazilian Unified Health System - SUS), are referred to as important assets to explain the difficulties to form a qualified primary health care service: the so-called 'villain physicians.' In the latter, ethnographic/cartographic research carried out in seven PHC Units in cities of São Paulo, with the use of scenes showing the doctors in action and/or thinking about their jobs, and the health team observing their work, more complex physicians emerge: fragile professionals with a reduced set of instruments to act before the 'social factor' that invade their practices, threatened in their autonomy, finding it hard to engage in teamwork, dispossessed of their regulatory functions, and unaware of the space reserved for primary practices: decidedly human physicians - neither heroes nor villains.
