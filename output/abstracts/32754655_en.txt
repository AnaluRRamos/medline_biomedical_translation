Statistical analysis included calculation of prevalence ratios (Poisson regression) and the simple t-test. About 62% and 63.3% of the participants reported neck and low back pain, respectively. The prevalence of neck (19%) and low back (16%) pain was higher among the participants who reported to feel always stressed regarding psychological pressure.
