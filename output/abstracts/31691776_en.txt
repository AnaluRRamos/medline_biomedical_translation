Innovation in health is characterized by strong interaction with the science and technology sector. Growing interest in the internationalization of research and development leads to questions on opportunities as a function of interactions with other countries, as a mechanism for national capacity-building in innovation. As clinical trials cross national borders and achieve global relevance, networks of relations between the actors become increasingly complex and present themselves as a possibility for characterizing interaction of national innovation systems at the global level, particularly from the point of view of producing activities in science, technology, and innovation in health. This study aimed to analyze the global expansion of clinical trials in order to discuss possible factors related to the interaction between national innovation systems in the countries involved. The methods included literature searches and analysis of secondary data. There is a growing interdependence between national innovation systems, requiring new international innovation structures. New opportunities emerge for the production and international dissemination of knowledge. Clinical trials promote and require interaction between companies, universities and government agencies, proving strategic for structuring national innovation systems in health in the global context.
