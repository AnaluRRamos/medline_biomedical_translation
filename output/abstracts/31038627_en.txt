during peripheral venipuncture, health professionals are recommended to use a tourniquet above the puncture site in order to potentiate venous distension. Given its characteristics and use in clinical settings, tourniquets may represent a source of microorganism dissemination. However, the results of scientific studies in this area are scattered in the literature. This scoping review aims to map the available evidence on health professionals' practices related with tourniquet use during peripheral venipuncture and associated microbiological contamination. scoping review following the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology. Two independent reviewers analyzed the relevance of the studies, extracted and synthesized data. fifteen studies were included in the review. Overall, tourniquets were reused without being subject to recurring decontamination processes. It has been found that practitioners share these devices among themselves and use them successively for periods between two weeks and seven and half years. nursing practices related to tourniquet use during peripheral venipuncture are not standard. Reuse of tourniquets may jeopardize the patient's safety if reprocessing (cleaning and disinfection/sterilization) is not adequate, given the type of tourniquet material and microbiota found. New studies are needed to assess the impact of various types of reprocessing practices on tourniquet decontamination and patient safety.
