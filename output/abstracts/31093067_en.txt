To evaluate whether participation in the Moms' Empowerment Program (MEP), a 10-week, 10-session intervention designed to provide support and increase access to available community resources for women experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV), enhanced the physical health of participants who self-identified as Latina. Mothers of children ages 4-12 who self-identified as Latina and had experienced IPV within the past two years were recruited at three intervention sites in Michigan, Ohio, and Texas, via community postings and referrals from agencies serving IPV-exposed families. Selected study participants (<i>n</i> = 93) were assigned to one of two groups: Treatment (immediate enrollment in the MEP) or Control (placement on a waitlist with an invitation to participate in the MEP after the 10-week study period). Data were drawn from two structured interviews, one at the time of recruitment for the study (Time One), and one following the intervention or wait period (Time Two). After controlling for age, educational attainment, and partner residence (living with a violent partner at the time of the interview), multilevel modeling revealed that improvement in physical health over time was significantly greater among women who participated in the intervention relative to controls. These data suggest that enhancing interpersonal connectedness and access to resources positively affects physical health for Latinas experiencing IPV.
