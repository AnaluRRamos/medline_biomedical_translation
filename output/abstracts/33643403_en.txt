In 2018, the Colombian Ministry of Health and Social Protection, in collaboration with the National Health Institute and the Pan American Health Organization, convened all actors associated with the National Tuberculosis Prevention and Control Program (PNPCT) and the National Science, Technology, and Innovation System to form a national network to coordinate operations research on tuberculosis (TB) in the country. Seven workshops were held and a consensus was reached to establish the National Network for Knowledge Management, Research, and Innovation in Tuberculosis in Colombia (TB Colombia Network). With more than 180 participants, a central node, and five regional nodes that bring together the country's 37 territorial entities, the TB Colombia Network conducted four days of training in operations research in 2019, defining 65 priority research topics aligned with the strategic lines in the PNPCT: prevention and comprehensive care, with a focus on people affected by TB (41 topics in three modules); and political commitment, social protection, and support systems (24 topics in four modules). The peer comparison method was used for prioritization. The TB Colombia Network remains active and contributes to knowledge management aimed at eliminating TB in Colombia. It has helped make progress in building plans and implementing local operations research projects that generate scientifically validated results to strengthen the PNPCT and improve the care of TB patients.
