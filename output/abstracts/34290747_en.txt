The association between the Metabolically Healthy Obese (MHO) phenotype in the absence of metabolic syndrome and subsequent cardiovascular disease remains unclear. We examined the association between MHO and CVD risk in young Iranian women. We studied 183 women aged 20-35 years from a population of 308 candidates. We classified participants into 4 phenotypes. We measured body composition, blood pressure, and biochemical factors in all participants. The Metabolically Healthy Normal Weight (MHNW) and Normal Weight Obese (NWO) phenotypes had no statistical differences in any biochemistry variables. FBS, TG, LDL/HDL, Cholesterol/HDL, hs-CRP, and atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) were all higher in Metabolically Unhealthy Obese (MUO) than MHO individuals, whereas HDL was higher in MHO than in MUO individuals. LDL/HDL and hs-CRP were higher in MHO participants than MHNW participants, whereas HDL-c was higher in MHNW than MHO. Results of the present study demonstrate that young women displaying the MHO phenotype have a favorable metabolic profile as shown by lower FBS, TG, LDL-c/HDL, Cho/HDL, hs-CRP, and AIP and higher HDL levels than the MUO phenotype. However, MHO individuals were still at greater risk of CVD incidence (lower HDL and higher hs-CRP levels) than MHNW individuals.
