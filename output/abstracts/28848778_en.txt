Most antidepressant agents have the potential to cause liver injury, even at therapeutic doses. Nevertheless, drug-induced liver injury (DILI) from antidepressant agents is a rare event. There is no way to prevent idiopathic DILI, but the severity of the reaction may be minimized with prompt recognition and early withdrawal of the agent. We describe a rare case of a 63-year-old man presenting with acute liver failure after 3 months of trazodone and diazepam administration at normal therapeutic doses, requiring liver transplantation. This report should increase physicians' awareness of this complication and call attention to the regular monitoring of liver tests in patients taking trazodone, in order to prevent life-threatening complications.
