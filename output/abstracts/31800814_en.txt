To characterize the scientific production available in the literature on the construction of terminological subsets of ICNP® with emphasis on the clientele and/or health priority to which the subsets are intended, the theoretical reference used and the validation process of constructed statements. An integrative review of the literature with bibliometric approach of publications between 2008 and 2017. Thirty-five (35) publications were included for analysis. Most of the studies were linked to postgraduate programs of universities in Northeast Brazil. Regarding the attended clientele, there was a trend towards the care of cancer, older adult and child/adolescent patients. For the theoretical reference for constructing the subset, there was a trend towards using the Basic Human Needs model. The validation process was not described in all studies. The importance of constructing terminological subsets of ICNP® aimed at priority health clientele is reinforced in order to enhance the use of this terminology. The methodological course should be based on specific methodologies, and the construction process should be parallel to the validation process.
