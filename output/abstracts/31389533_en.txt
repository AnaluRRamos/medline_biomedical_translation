This study aimed to validate of Fall Risk Tracking Tool (FRRISque) in elderly community dwellers. A cross-sectional evaluative screening study was carried out on a sample of 854 elderly. In addition to the pilot version of FRRISque, the QuickScreenÂ® tool was applied as a standard reference in order to validate a concurrent criterion, determining sensitivity and specificity values. Most of the elderly people were female (57.6%) with an average age of 71.87 years. The multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that only 10 FRRISque items contribute to increased elderly fall risk and they refer to the risk factors of previous falls, use of a walking aid device, polypharmacy, use of psychotropic substances, difficulty to ascend and descend a slope, difficulty to walk for a distance of 100 meters, visual and hearing impairment, low physical activity and poorly lit environment. This risk stratification model assumes sensitivity values of 91.3% and specificity values of 73.4%. The FRRISque is defined as a valid, simple, low-cost and of easy and rapid application tool that can be used by all primary health care professionals, including community health workers.
