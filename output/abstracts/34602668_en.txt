Although contrast-enhanced ultrasound has been shown to provide considerable benefits, particularly in pediatric patients, it is still used relatively rarely in Brazil. It has proven to be a safe technique, and adverse effects are rare. In this review, we address the technique and main applications of contrast-enhanced ultrasound in the pediatric population, including the evaluation of focal liver lesions, abdominal trauma, kidney grafts, liver grafts, bowel loops, and vesicoureteral reflux. It is important for pediatric radiologists to be acquainted with this promising tool, understanding its applications and limitations.
