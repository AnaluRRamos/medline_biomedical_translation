Analyzing the frequency patterns of practicing sports, the stages of change phases and the pros and cons of decision-making balance in nursing students related to gender and which year of study they are in. A cross-sectional, descriptive and exploratory study. 535 students of both genders participated in the study. An analysis of the results revealed that 27.6% of the students did not present any frequency of practicing sports; 55.3% of the students did not have a consistent or continuous habit of practicing sports; students overall exhibited a non-existing frequency of practicing sports at similar levels throughout the study cycle; male students presented similar percentages in their positioning in the precontemplation and contemplation stages throughout the study cycle; and throughout all the stages of change phases students showed higher values for pros over cons related to practicing sports. The results reinforce the relevance for implementing mechanisms for promoting and monitoring nursing students' involvement and regular participation in practicing sports.
