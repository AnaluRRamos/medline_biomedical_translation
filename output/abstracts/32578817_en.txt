Genetic polymorphisms of CYP3A5 have been pointed out as factors that influenciates tacrolimus immunosuppressive efficacy in post liver transplant patients. This study aims to review the literature on the influence of cytochrome P450 3A5 (CYP3A5) genetic polymorphisms of tacrolimus in post-liver transplant patients. This study is a literature review. A combination of the descriptors 'tacrolimus', 'liver transplant', 'cytochrome P-450 CYP3A inhibitors' and 'genetic polymorphism' were used in the databases PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus and Scielo, being evaluated only studies between 2009 and 2019 in English, Portuguese or Spanish. A total of six studies, each from a different population were summarized. Initially, the pharmacological aspects of tacrolimus were discussed, including details on its pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and toxicity After that, we analyzed the studies that correlates CYP3A5 genetic polymorphisms and tacrolimus efficacy, including the ethnical specifications and the general limittions of the studies. The CYP3A5 polymorphisms have pointed to alterations in the metabolism of tacrolimus according to the ethnic and populational genotype, specially the *1 and *3*3 alleles, reflecting in the need for dose adjustment and also in post liver transplant rejection.
