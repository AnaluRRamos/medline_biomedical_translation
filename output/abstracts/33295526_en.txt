To measure medication non-adherence in patients after heart transplantation using the Basel Assessment of Adherence to Immunosuppressive Medications Scale (BAASIS) and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS); to compare the results of biopsies performed with the prevalent comorbidities and survival. Quantitative historical cohort. The population consisted of patients undergoing transplantation between 2009 and 2016. Participation of 60 patients. The measurement using the BAASIS was 46.7% of non-adherence and 53.3% of patient adherence. The group with greater difficulty in non-adherence reported up to 2 hours delay of medication intake in relation to the prescribed time (25%), although there was no interruption in medications. The initial diagnosis was Chagas disease (33.3%). The studied comorbidities were systemic arterial hypertension (SAH), diabetes mellitus (DM), dyslipidemia (DLP) and chronic renal failure (CRF). Assessment using the BAASIS showed medication non-adherence in 46.7% of heart transplant patients. The VAS according to patients' self-report and nurse's assessment showed high values (93.3% vs 83.3%). The BAASIS tends to address the difficulties reported by patients, when there is a change in doses, delays or anticipations of time and dose.
