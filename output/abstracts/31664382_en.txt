Toothache is a public health problem that causes great inconvenience to psychoactive substances users. The objective was to verify the prevalence of dental pain and its associations among psychoactive substances users from Alcohol and Drug Psychosocial Care Centers (CAPS AD) in Vitoria, Vila Velha and Serra, Esp√≠rito Santo, Brazil. A transversal study was conducted with 280 participants between June 2015 and February 2016, using five scripts: one for socio-demographic data and health perception; another for oral health; the Oral Health Impact Profile; the Alcohol Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Test. Data were organized in frequency tables and analyzed with the SPSS 20 statistical package. Comparisons were made with Fisher's test and the Odds Ratio (OR) was used to check the strength of the association between the variables. The prevalence of pain in the population studied was 59.3%, and individuals whose quality of life was impacted due to their oral conditions were 2.2 times more likely to report toothache in the last 6 months. The population studied showed a high prevalence of dental pain and the study indicates that dental pain interferes in the quality of life of psychoactive substances users who are treated at CAPS AD services in these three cities.
