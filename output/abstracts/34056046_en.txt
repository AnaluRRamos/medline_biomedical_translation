Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy is a safe and effective technique and its use is widely spread. Peristomal leakage may occur within the first few days after gastrostomy tube placement and also in the mature gastrostomy tract. The initial treatment involves conservative measures. If the leakage does not resolve, different endoscopic interventions could be necessary with consequent impairing of enteral nutrition and, in some cases, the need of creating a new gastro-cutaneous fistula. We present 4 consecutive cases complicated with late peristomal leakage and medical treatment failure. These patients underwent upper digestive endoscopy, and circumferential fulguration of the mucosa surrounding the tube with pulsed argon plasma coagulation (APC) at 50 W and 1 L/min flow rate was performed. Additional long through-the-scope clips were applied in 2 cases, since the inner orifice remained enlarged, in order to obtain a better closure. Complete leakage and skin changes resolution occurred between 2 and 6 weeks after the procedure (mean 3.5 weeks). The overall mean follow-up was 19 months after the endoscopic procedure (maximum 30 months, minimum 10 months). There was no recurrence of leakage. The use of APC alone or combined with long through-the-scope clips in large internal stoma orifice resolved persistent leakage from percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy in all 4 presented cases without complications. In our case series, this technique appeared to be an effective, safe, and relatively low-cost alternative to the treatment of persistent peristomal leakage of the mature gastrostomy tract.
