The scope of this study was to assess the association between preoperative pain, anxiety and the impact of the oral condition on the quality of life of patients treated at the Dental Emergency Service at the Federal University of the Jequitinhonha and Mucuri Valleys. A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted evaluating data from 240 patient charts aged from 18 to 65 years. Pain was measured by the Heft-Parker Visual Analog Scale; dental anxiety by Corah's Dental Anxiety Scale; and oral health-related quality of life by the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14). Associations were analyzed using Pearson's Chi-square test (p < 0.05). A statistically significant association was observed between pain and poorer quality of life, with impacts on psychological discomfort (p < 0.001), physical incapacity (p < 0.001) and the psychological (p < 0.001) and social (p < 0.001) domains. Anxiety influenced poorer quality of life, with impacts on the psychological discomfort (p = 0.009), physical disability (p = 0.016), psychological disability (p = 0.011) and social disadvantage (p = 0.028) domains. This study is relevant for the planning of programs and actions aimed at the oral health of patients treated in dental emergency services, prioritizing those with the greatest psychosocial impact arising from oral problems.
