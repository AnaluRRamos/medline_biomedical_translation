The objective was to assess the prevalence of maternal breastfeeding and associated factors in Brazilian children under two years of age. This was a cross-sectional nationwide study in 2013. The outcomes were breastfeeding in children under 24 months and exclusive breastfeeding under six months of age. A hierarchical analysis was performed for associated factors. The analyses were stratified by age (0-5 months and 29 days; 6-11 months and 29 days; 12-23 months and 29 days of age). Prevalence of maternal breastfeeding was 56% for the total sample, and as follows according to age: 80% (0-5 months and 29 days), 62.3% (6-11 months and 29 days), and 40.1% (12-23 months and 29 days). In the adjusted analyses, in all the age brackets, higher prevalence of breastfeeding was associated with consumption of fewer milk products. In children from 6 months to 11 months and 29 days, living in the North of Brazil, black skin color, and the lowest quintile of household assets were associated with higher breastfeeding prevalence. In children from 12 months to 23 months and 29 days of age, higher breastfeeding prevalence was associated with black skin color, consumption of healthy liquids and foods, living in urban areas, head-of-household's higher educational level, and more household assets. Overall prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding was 20.6% and was higher in the South, in families with head-of-household's higher educational level, and more household assets. The prevalence rates for breastfeeding and exclusive breastfeeding of Brazilian children under two years can be considered low. Existing policies to increase the prevalence rates of maternal breastfeeding at any age should be reinforced.
