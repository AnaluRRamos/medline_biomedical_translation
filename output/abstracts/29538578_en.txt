This paper is an integrative review of the literature that sought to identify the factors that influence the adhesion and acceptance of school food among Brazilian and American students, and to show the main differences between the programs of these two countries. the following databases were consulted: Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences (Lilacs); Pubmed; Scientific Electronic Library Online (Scielo); and Science Direct. Data were collected between July and August 2015, using the following key words in Portuguese and English: 'adherence to school food' (adesão à alimentação escolar), 'accepting of school feeding' (aceitação à alimentação escolar) and the 'National School Lunch Program' ('Programa Nacional de Alimentação Escolar'). The search resulted in 7 Brazilian articles and 7 Americans articles published between 2004 and 2014, besides the current laws of each program, selected in the electronic sites of agencies responsible for administrating them. After descriptive and comparative analysis, the results revealed that adherence and acceptance are low in both programs, and they are influenced by socioeconomic factors, competitive foods present in the school environment and students' food preferences.
