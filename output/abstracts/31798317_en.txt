This study compared groups of patients with calcaneal fractures of Sanders types II and III. One group was treated with ORIF using an LCP (plate), while the second was treated with a minimally invasive method using a C-Nail. The study included 217 patients in the ORIF group and 19 patients in the minimally invasive nail osteosynthesis group. In the LCP group, the outcomes were excellent for 35.7% of the patients; good, 38.9%; satisfactory, 19.7%; and poor, 5.7%. In the C-Nail group, the outcomes were excellent for 36.9% of the patients; good; 31.6%; satisfactory, 21%; and poor, 10.2%. The mean values of the restoration of Böhler's angle from post-injury were 6.8° to 32.3° in the LCP group and 7.1° to 33.3° in the C-Nail group. After 12 months, there was only a minimal decrease in Böhler's angle to 29.2° in both the LCP and C-Nail groups. The outcomes obtained with C-Nail fixation are statistically identical to those obtained with LCP fixation. We conclude that osteosynthesis with a C-Nail is suitable as the first-choice treatment for Sanders types II and III fractures. <b><i>Level of evidence IV, retrospective observational study.</i></b>
