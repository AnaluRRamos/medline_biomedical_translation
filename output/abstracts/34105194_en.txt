Serological allergen testing (SAT) is used widely to formulate allergen-specific immunotherapy for atopic dogs. Serum immunoglobulin (Ig)E specific for cross-reactive carbohydrate determinants (CCD) can produce false-positive reactions, creating discrepancy between SAT and intradermal allergen test (IDAT) results. The primary objective was to determine if inhibition of anti-CCD IgE in a commercial assay improved correlation with IDAT. The secondary objective was to assess the influence of dog- and clinic-specific factors, environmental factors, putative allergen exposure and prior medications on intradermal and SAT reactivity. Two-hundred and eleven client-owned dogs were enrolled from eight North American dermatology specialty practices. Collection of serum samples and IDAT were performed on the same day. Sera were assayed for detection of IgE specific to 25 allergens, before and after treatment with a proprietary inhibitor of anti-CCD IgE. Data for each dog were collected via a questionnaire filled out by veterinary personnel. The correlation between the testing modalities was fair before (Spearman's rho, ρ = 0.2092) and after (ρ = 0.3042) inhibition of anti-CCD IgE. Ciclosporin dose (P = 0.003), independent of duration of use, and duration of lokivetmab use (P = 0.001), independent of dose administered, were associated with statistically significant decreases in IgE concentrations across all allergen types. Contrary to previous reports, this study demonstrated unchanged correlation between SAT and IDAT after inhibition of anti-CCD IgE. Ciclosporin dose and lokivetmab treatment duration may have unexplored effects on IgE concentration during SAT.
