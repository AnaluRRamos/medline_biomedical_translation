Several anthropometric indexes have been proposed to determine the association between overweight and cardiovascular risk factors. To evaluate the relationship between body adiposity and microvascular reactivity in hypertensive patients under antihypertensive therapy. Treated hypertensive patients aged 40 to 70 were submitted to evaluation of anthropometric indexes: conicity (CI), body adiposity (BAI), visceral adiposity (VAI) and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR). Participants were divided by the terciles of fat percentage (%F) obtained by bioelectrical impedance. The patients underwent microvascular reactivity test (Laser Speckle Contrast Image) and pulse wave velocity (PWV) measurement. The p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. The variation of the area under the curve (AUC) of the skin perfusion was lower in the upper tercile (97±57% vs. 67±36%; p=0.027). %F showed significant correlation with WHtR (r=0.77; p<0.001), VAI (r=0.41; p=0.018), CI (r=0.60; p<0.001), BAI (r=0.65; p<0.001) in men and only with WHtR (r=0.55; p<0.001) and BAI (r=0.60; p<0.001) in women. In linear regression, AUC was independently associated with %F (β=−3.15; p=0.04) in women and with blood glucose (β=−1.15; p=0.02) in men. There was no difference in PWV measurements. Anthropometric indices were more associated with %F in men. Higher body adiposity was associated with lower microvascular reactivity, which was more evident in women. There was no difference in arterial stiffness, which may have been influenced by antihypertensive treatment.
