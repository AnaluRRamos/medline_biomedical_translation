The history of Primary Health Care (PHC) in the Federal District (DF) is as old as the history of the Federative Unit. The history of Family and Community Medicine (MFC), however, is relatively recent, both locally and nationally. This paper proposes to focus on the fundamental contribution of MFC to advances in Public Health in the Federal District, especially in the last 10 years, after the founding of the Family and Community Medicine Association of Bras√≠lia (ABMFC). In order to do so, the most relevant historical events and contexts related to Health Care, Management, Social Control and Medical Education - including Undergraduate course and Residency - were documented, which support this position, in parallel with the evolution of the specialty in the Federal District. Therefore, its organization was divided into four historical stages: until 2008, from 2008 to 2011, from 2011 to 2016, and from 2016 to 2018.
