To evaluate the effects of motivational interviewing for the change of social support behavior of caregivers of breast cancer patients in chemotherapy. A quasi-experimental study conducted with women in chemotherapy for breast cancer and their respective caregivers. The intervention of Brief Motivational Interviewing was applied to the caregivers indicated by patients in four individual sessions with weekly intervals and duration of 30 minutes each. The social support behavior was evaluated by women before and after the intervention through the Social Support Scale. Eighteen women and 18 caregivers participated in the study. The social support of women was higher for both the emotional and the instrumental dimensions of the Social Support Scale after the intervention of Brief Motivational Interviewing with caregivers. These findings contribute to the clinical practice of several professional categories in the use of low-cost intervention strategies for improvement of the quality of life during and after treatment of women with breast cancer. The intervention positively promoted behavioral change by improving the social support provided by caregivers to breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.
