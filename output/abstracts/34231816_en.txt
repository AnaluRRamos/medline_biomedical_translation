A 37-year-old woman (35 weeks pregnant) was admitted to a local hospital due to severe epistaxis resulting in shock and the need for emergency cesarean section. After failure to tamponade the bleeding, angiographic treatment was provided. After the procedure, she was admitted to the neurocritical intensive care unit and was confused and agitated, requiring sedation and endotracheal intubation. In the intensive care unit, diagnostic investigations included brain magnetic resonance imaging, lumbar puncture with viral panel, electroencephalogram, tests for autoimmunity, and hydroelectrolytic and metabolic evaluations. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a puntiform restricted diffusion area on the left corona radiata on diffusion weighted imaging and mild cortical posterior edema (without restricted diffusion), and an electroencephalogram showed moderate diffuse slow activity and fronto-temporal slow activity of the left hemisphere with associated scarce paroxysmal components. The other exams did not show any relevant alterations. Due to the temporal relationship, the clinical history and the magnetic resonance imaging results, a diagnosis of contrast-induced encephalopathy was made. After 2 days in the intensive care unit, sedation was withdrawn, the patient was extubated, and total neurological recovery was verified within the next 24 hours.
