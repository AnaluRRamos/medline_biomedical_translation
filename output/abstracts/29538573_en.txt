The scope of this study was to determine the prevalence of anemia and the correlation between the concentration of hemoglobin and cognitive factors in an elderly population group resident in Campina Grande, Paraiba, Brazil. It was a cross-sectional study with individuals aged 60 or older. Men with hemoglobin levels <13 g / dL and women with levels <12 g / dL were considered anemic. Sociodemographic, cognitive condition and nutritional status variables were analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed by means of simple and multiple linear regression. Among the 360 elderly patients evaluated (67.2% women), the prevalence of anemia was 12.5%. The average concentration of hemoglobin found was 13.5 g / dL and was correlated to sex variables (β = -0.44, 95% CI: -1.35, -0.85), age (β = -0.14 ; 95% CI: -0.03, -0.01), nutritional status (β = 0.16; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.06), memory impairment (β = 0.12; 95% CI: - 0.06, -0.01), and dementia (β = -0.13, 95% CI: -0.06, -0.01). Routine blood testing among the elderly makes it possible to detect and treat anemia at an early stage. Actions geared towards the elderly who show a cognitive decline should be developed in the Basic Family Health Units in order to improve the quality of life of this population.
