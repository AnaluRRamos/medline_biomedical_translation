Elevated immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels to Malassezia or Staphylococcus species in human atopic dermatitis are related to the skin severity index; a similar association has not been reported in atopic dogs. To investigate serum levels of allergen-specific IgE, total specific IgG and IgG subclasses (IgG1 and IgG2) for M. pachydermatis and S. pseudintermedius, and to correlate them with the severity of dermatitis in dogs. Serum samples were collected from dogs categorized by age and disease status. Groups 1 and 2: <3-year-old healthy (n = 9) and atopic dogs (n = 9), respectively; and groups 3 and 4: ≥3-year-old healthy (n = 11) and atopic dogs (n = 14), respectively. Antibody levels were measured by ELISA. The Canine Atopic Dermatitis Lesion Index (CADLI) was analyzed in relation to antibody levels. Specific IgE and total IgG against M. pachydermatis and S. pseudintermedius were significantly increased in atopic dogs of all ages. Although differences between atopic and healthy dogs, with regard to specific IgG1 and IgG2 levels to each microbe, varied in significance within age groups. No significant relationships were found between the CADLI and any specific immunoglobulin levels for both microbe types. In dog skin, microbes may act as allergens triggering inflammatory responses via IgE- and IgG-dependent pathway(s). The affinity of the IgG subclass produced may vary according to antigen type. Specific IgE levels may be related to clinical disease in dogs and not to skin lesion severity.
