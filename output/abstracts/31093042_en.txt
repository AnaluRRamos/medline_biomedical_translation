In 2013, the PAHO Member States recognized the epidemic of chronic kidney disease of non-traditional causes (CKDnT) as a serious public health problem. This article describes the establishment of research priorities to comprehensively address CKDnT in Central America. Following a search of the literature for research studies carried out in Central America and prior research agendas on CKD, a virtual survey was conducted using the Delphi methodology. The respondents were identified from various sources. The first round sought to refine and add research topics and to prioritize those deemed most relevant. The second round prioritized the most relevant topics. A fuzzy-sets analysis was carried out to estimate decision thresholds and scores for each topic. The survey was sent to 83 Spanish-speaking and 38 English-speaking prospective respondents. The response rate was 46.2%. For the second round, the survey was sent to 56 Spanish-speaking and 16 English-speaking first-round respondents. Eighteen topics within 10 research areas were prioritized: public policies, determinants, etiology, diagnosis and treatment of CKD, primary prevention, service delivery, human resources, information systems, and funding. Research on CKDnT was found to be scarce and restricted to certain topics. In addition to etiological factors, great importance was assigned to aspects related to the health system response, including service delivery approaches, human resources, funding, and occupational and environmental aspects.
