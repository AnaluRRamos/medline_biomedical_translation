The objectives were to describe the prevalence of occupational exposure to noise and to analyze associated factors in the Brazilian population. This cross-sectional population-based study used data from the Brazilian National Health Survey (PNS, 2013). The sample consisted of 36,442 Brazilians 18 years or older. The outcome variable was self-reported exposure to noise during work. To assess possible factors associated with exposure to noise, we used Pearson's chi-square test and the univariate and multivariate Poisson model with robust variance. The results showed 32.1% prevalence of exposure to noise, varying from 40.9% (Santa Catarina, Brazil) to 21.9% (Piau√≠, Brazil). Prevalence was lower in women (PR = 0.57; 95%CI: 0.55-0.59) and in individuals 55 years or older (PR = 0.70; 95%CI: 0.65-0.76). Higher prevalence was associated with the 25-54-year age bracket (PR = 1.00; 95%CI: 0.95-1.06), middle schooling level (PR = 1.36; 95%CI: 1.29-1.44), self-reported fatigue (PR = 1.35; 95%CI: 1.30-1.40), hearing impairment (PR = 1.27; 95%CI: 1.19-1.35), and history of work-related accident (PR = 1.37; 95%CI: 1.25-1.50). Prevalence of self-reported exposure to occupational noise was higher than in three other Latin American countries. Higher prevalence among men, younger workers, and those with less schooling was expected. The associations with auditory and non-auditory problems suggest the need for systemic interventions. Adjustments to the questions in the PNS are desirable to favor comparability and monitoring.
