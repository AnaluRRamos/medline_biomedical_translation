To compare the final score of the scale to the levels of HbA1c. Cross-sectional observational study by applying the Diabetes Empowerment Scale-Short Form to diabetics at three primary care units in the central region of Portugal. The test-retest (in writing first and, five minutes later, orally) was performed to access Cronbach's alpha in 20 patients not studied in the next phase. Then, the scale was applied to diabetic patients after nursing consultation and prior to entering the medical consultation. Descriptive and inferential statistics after checking for the normality of the data were performed. In the first phase Cronbach's alpha was 0.90 to 1.00 in all of eight scale items. The average result obtained in the written phase was 3.78 ± 0.71 and in the oral 3.79 ± 0.64, p = 0.629. The sample of the second stage was of 81 diabetic patients, 55.6% male. Sample's mean age was 68.5 ± 1.1 years, mean HbA1c of 6.8 ± 0.2 and mean time from diagnosis of 9.2 ± 0.9 years. The average final score of the scale was 4.1± 0.8. There was significant correlation between the final score and HbA1c levels (p= -0.114; p = 0.312). The Portuguese version of the Diabetes Empowerment Scale-Short Form proved to be a reliable scale to measure empowerment in diabetic patients in Portugal. It was evident the presence of a statistically significant correlation between the results obtained at the end of the scale and HbA1c.
