To assess the histopathologic and biomechanical effects of hyaluronic acid (HA) and high-dose vitamin C (VC) on rat Achilles tendon healing. Forty-eight Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to HA and VC and control groups with equal numbers. Each group was further divided into two subgroups to be sacrificed on Day 15 (n=8) and Day 30 (n=8). The Achilles tendons were cut and repaired. While the control rats remained untreated, HA and VC were administered after repair. The repaired tendons were removed for biomechanical and histopathologic analyses. In the biomechanical tests, the tendons were stretched to failure and maximum forces were measured. For histopathologic examination, the specimens were interpreted semiquantitatively using Movin's grading scale and Bonar scores. The highest mean forces were obtained in the HA group on Day 15 and in the VC group on Day 30, with a significant difference between HA and VC on Day 15 between control and VC on Day 30 (p<0.05). Histological examination showed both Movin and Bonar scores decreased in all groups on Day 30, with significant improvements in the HA and VC groups (p<0.05). Our results demonstrated that both VC and HA had therapeutic effects on tendon healing, especially in the late phase. Level of Evidence I; High quality randomized trial with statistically significant difference.
