In the last years, several diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers have been studied in cardiovascular disease. Growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15), a cytokine belonging to the transforming growth factor- (TGF-) family, is highly up-regulated in stress and inflammatory conditions and has been correlated to myocardial injury and pressure cardiac overload in animal models. This new biomarker has been positively correlated with increased risk of cardiovascular events in population studies and shown an independent predictor of mortality in patients with coronary artery disease and heart failure. This review aimed to summarize the current evidence on the diagnostic and prognostic value of GDF-15 in different settings in cardiology.
