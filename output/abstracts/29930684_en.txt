Despite technological advances, the long-term outcomes of endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) are still debatable. Although most endograft failures after EVAR can be corrected with endovascular techniques, open conversion may still be required. A 70-year-old male patient presented at the emergency unit with abdominal pain. Twice, in the third and fourth years after the first repair, a stent graft had been placed over a non-adhesive portion of the stent graft due to type Ia endoleaks. In the most recent admission, a CT scan showed type III endoleak and ruptured aneurysm sac. On this occasion the patient underwent late open conversion. The failure was repaired with total preservation of the main endovascular graft body and interposition of a bifurcated dacron graft. This case demonstrates that lifelong radiographic surveillance should be considered in this subset of patients. Late open conversion following EVAR of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms can be performed safely.
