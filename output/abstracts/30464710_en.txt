To compare the widening of bone tunnels between poly-etheretherketone (PEEK), absorbable polylactic acid DL (PLDL) and tricalcium phosphate (TCP) interference screws in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Three groups of patients undergoing ACL reconstruction with at least 1 year of follow-up using the out-in drilling technique and hamstring as a graft were assessed. The patients were divided according to the type of interference screw used (PEEK, PLDL and TCP). Computed tomography (CT) was performed to measure the greatest femoral and tibial tunnel widening regarding to the initial tunnel, and then it was compared between groups. Mean widening in group 1 (PEEK) was 39.56% (SD 16%) in the femoral tunnel and 33.65% (SD 20%) in the tibia. In group 2 (PLDL) mean widening was 48.43% in the femoral tunnel (SD 18%) and 35.24% (SD 13%) in the tibial tunnel. In group 3 (TCP) mean widening was 44.51% in the femur (SD 14%) and 36.83% in the tibia (SD 14%). The comparison between groups (PLDL-PEEK, PLDL-TCP, PEEK-TCP) shows no statistically significant difference. Bone tunnel enlargement values after ACL reconstruction with the use of different types of materials (bioinert and biomaterials) of interference screws (PEEK, PLDL and TCP) were similar. <b><i>Level of Evidence III, Comparative retrospective study.</i></b>
