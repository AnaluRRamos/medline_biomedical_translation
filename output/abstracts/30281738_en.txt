The present population study aimed at identifying the prevalence of mental health problems (MHP) and describing health services use in a sample of children attending Primary Healthcare Units (PHU) in the city of Sao Paulo. Caregivers of 825 6-11 years old children were assessed. MHP were assessed with the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire and health services use with an adapted version of the Client Receipt Inventory Children`s version. Prevalence of internalizing and externalizing MHP was 30.7% and 18.3%, respectively. Pediatricians were the most consulted health professional (56.7%) and psychologists the most consulted mental health professional (7.9%). Only 3 children were under medication treatment for MHP. The high prevalence of MHP among children in the primary care setting and the low rate of treatment constitute a public health problem. Training programs for health professionals are relevant to help identify and refer MHP cases.
