To evaluate the correlation between vocal handicap index and the quality of life of popular singers. Transversal study. The data was collected through personal interviews and the use of the following instruments: World Health Organization Quality of Life-bref (WHOQOL-bref), the Modern Singing Handicap Index (MSHI) and a questionnaire about the singer's sociodemographic profiles and their self-perceived complaints. The level of significance was 5% (p <0.05). A descriptive analysis of the WHOQOL-bref and the IDCM scores was done using absolute and relative frequencies, mean and standard deviation. Quantitative variables were tested with Komolgorov-Smirnov, using non-parametric tests Kruskal Wallis and U Mann-Whitney. Correlation between the WHOQOL-bref and MSHI instruments was made with Spearman's Correlation Test. Reliability of the instruments tested by Cronbach's Alpha test. Sample of 206 popular singers who were mostly man, single, with higher education or postgraduate and income of up to six minimum wages a month. Majority of them had high scores in WHOQOL-bref, indicating self-perception of good quality of life. Most singers report vocal complaints. The ones without vocal complaints showed self-perception of a better quality of life and lower vocal handicap with meaningful statistical significance in all WHOQOL-bref domains and MSHI subscales. Singers over 40 years old and with higher incomes showed better perception of their quality of life and lower vocal handicap. There was negative or weak correlation between the MSHI and the WHOQOL-bref. Better quality of life had correlation among the group with lower vocal handicap.
