Endoscopic ultrasound-guided biliary drainage (EUS-BD) is an alternative to percutaneous and surgical drainage in bile duct obstruction when endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography fails. EUS-BD can be achieved with several techniques, including EUS-guided hepaticogastrostomy (HGS), anterograde transpapillary stent placement, choledochoduodenostomy (CDS), and rendez-vous technique. Lately, with increased experience and development of directed equipment, elevated technical and clinical success as well of lower adverse event rates have been reported. In this article, GRUPUGE presents an updated perspective of the potential role of EUS-guided biliary drainage, addressing the selection criteria and technical issues of different techniques and analyzing recent data on their safety and efficacy.
