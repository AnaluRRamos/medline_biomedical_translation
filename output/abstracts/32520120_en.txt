to validate self-reported body weight of Programa Academia da Saúde (PAS) users in Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil, and to identify factors associated with weight error. self-reported body weight, obtained by telephone interview, was compared to measured weight; we used Student's t-test, ANOVA, Lin's concordance correlation coefficient, the Bland-Altman method and Kappa coefficient; women's self-reported weight was corrected according to measured weight using multiple regression. 441 users participated; weight self-reported by men was valid (error=0; p=0.15); overweight classification concordance was 94.3% (Kappa=0.88); errors were greater in the case of self-reported weight by women over 30 years old and overweight women (-0.8kg; error≠0; p<0.01); after correction using multiple regression, self-reported weight validity was satisfactory (error=0; p=0.99). self-reported weight of men can be used for research and health surveillance, but for women correction is required.
