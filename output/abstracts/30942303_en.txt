The article explores the dissemination of natural childbirth practices through an analysis of the books Parto natural: guia para os futuros pais, written by U.S. obstetrician Frederick Goodrich Jr. in 1950, under the title Natural Childbirth: a manual for expectant parents, and first published in Brazil in 1955, and of Parto natural sem dor, written by Brazilian obstetrician Beutner in 1962. Both books found a place in Brazilian culture and influenced thinking about childbirth and delivery in the field of Brazilian obstetrics and in representations of women. Based on Roger Chartier's contributions and on concepts of medicalization, we conclude that these new practices for childbirth preparation shared the period's prevalent medical views of childbirth and delivery.
