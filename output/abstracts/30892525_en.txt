The objective was to measure the Quality of Life (QoL) of the patients treated in Primary Health Care in the city of Rio de Janeiro and its own association with CMD, alcohol consumption and socio-demographic aspects. This is a cross-sectional study involving 624 patients in 2012/2013, using: General Health Questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Screening for Somatoform Symptoms, Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test e World Health Organization Quality of Life Instrument (bref version). There were conducted a bivariate analysis and a multiple linear regressions for each domain of QOL. The QoL score for the domains, physical, psychological, social relationships and environment were: 61,2; 62,6; 66 and 50,9. In multivariate analysis, the QOL was negatively associated to the CMD, especially in the psychological domain (β = -15,75; p-value = 0,00), and the dependence on physical (β = -5,38; p-value = 0,05). There was a positive and significant association of the QoL with the risk consumption (β = 5,77) and the harmful consumption (β = 6,15) in the environment domain, and with the first in the psychological domain (β = 7,08). CMD and alcohol dependence are associated with the loss of QOL, but other patterns of consumption, even being harmful are associated with higher QOL.
