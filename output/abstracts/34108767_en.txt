Parathyroid adenoma is the most common cause of primary hyperparathyroidism. Advances in surgical techniques have made it possible to excise only the affected parathyroid gland in most cases. Imaging examinations play a fundamental role in the preoperative planning of parathyroidectomy. To localize the parathyroid glands, imaging tests such as scintigraphy, ultrasound, and, more recently, four-dimensional computed tomography (4D CT). The aim of this pictorial review was to illustrate the use of the 4D CT protocol in cases of parathyroid adenoma and to determine how well it correlates with other imaging methods, in order to improve understanding of the 4D CT method.
