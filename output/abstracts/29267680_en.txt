With the aim of assessing the occurrence of severe intimate partner physical violence as a risk factor for inadequate screening of uterine cervical cancer, a case-control study was performed with a multidimensional questionnaire in a sample of 640 users of the Family Health Strategy in the Municipality of Nova Igua√ßu, Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. Cases were defined as women who had not had a cervical cytology test in the previous three years. The results showed that severe physical violence against the woman (adjustedOR = 2.2; 95%CI: 1.1-4.4) and co-occurrence of the event in the couple (adjustedOR = 3.8; 95%CI: 1.4-9.8) were risk factors for inadequate screening. Alcohol abuse by the woman was an effect modifier for not having the test among victims of violence (adjustedOR = 10.2; 95%CI: 1.8-56.4) and in cases of co-occurrence of violence (adjustedOR = 8.5; 95%CI: 1.4-50.7). In addition to known causal factors for intimate partner violence, the results point to a risk association between women's exposure to abuse and inadequate screening. The findings call for an expanded view of women's absenteeism from screening, since this indicator can represent unmet demands not readily detected by health teams.
