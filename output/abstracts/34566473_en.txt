The medial longitudinal arch is the main structure of load bearing and shock absorption of the foot. The evaluation of medial longitudinal arch, such as the navicular height, the medial longitudinal arch angle and the Feiss line should be performed with the subtalar joint in the neutral and relaxed position. Our study analyzed the correlation between the measurements of the subtalar joint in neutral and relaxed positions during the evaluation tests of the medial longitudinal arch. This is a cross-sectional study, in which 51 healthy volunteers (102 feet; 36 women; 28 ± 5 years, 1.66 ± 0.10 m; 24.5 ± 4.5 kg/m2) had their navicular height, medial longitudinal arch angle and Feiss line measured in the neutral and relaxed positions. The correlation between the measures was evaluated using Pearson's test. A strong correlation of the 102 feet Feiss line measurements between neutral and relaxed positions (r = 0.81) was observed, and a moderate correlation between the medial longitudinal arch angle (r = 0.78) and between navicular height in neutral and relaxed positions (r = 0.76). The measurements of the longitudinal medial arch between the neutral and relaxed positions are strongly correlated. Therefore, it is not necessary to measure the medial longitudinal arch in both neutral and relaxed positions. <b><i>Level of Evidence II, Diagnostic Studies - Investigating a diagnostic test.</i></b>
