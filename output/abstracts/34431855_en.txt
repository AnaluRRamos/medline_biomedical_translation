To analyze the outpatient production of aspects of hearing aids (HA) provision by the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) between 2005 and 2018. This is an ecological time-series study, based on data from the Outpatient Information System of the SUS and the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. The HA provision rates were analyzed with Joinpoint software. Descriptive analyses were carried out for technological categories, funding, HA replacement and audiological monitoring. The South (9.96/10,000 inhabitants) and North (3.20/10,000 inhabitants) regions recorded the highest and lowest average rates, respectively. There were significant upward trends in HA provision in Brazil, in the North, Southeast and Midwest regions, with subsequent significant downward trends in the Southeast and Midwest. In the country, HA concession by technological categories was A (39.26%), B (36.93%) and C (23.81%), increasing funding. The Midwest (24.78%) and Northeast (14.22%) regions had the highest and lowest proportion of HA replacement, respectively. The audiological monitoring predominated in the Southeast (45.88%), with the lowest occurrence in the North (4.18%). Between 2005 and 2018, trends fluctuated and discrepancies between geographic regions were observed in HA provision by the SUS, in addition to mismatches in the provision of technological categories and funding, a considerable proportion of replacements and insufficient audiological monitoring for HA users.
