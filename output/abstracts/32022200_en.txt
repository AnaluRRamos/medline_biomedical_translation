We analyzed the factors associated with dementia in the elderly attended at a memory outpatient clinic of the University of Southern Santa Catarina (UNISUL). This is a cross-sectional study with data analysis of medical records from January 2013 to April 2016. The outcome was the clinical diagnosis of dementia. The control variables were: serum vitamin D level at the time of diagnosis, gender, skin color, schooling, age, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and depression. We performed a crude and adjusted analysis with logistic regression. The sample consisted of 287 elderly, with the predominance of age between 60 and 69 years (48.78%), female (79.09%) and white (92.33%). The mean number of years of study was 6.95 years (SD ± 4.95) and mean vitamin D was 26.09 ng/mL (SD ± 9,20). The prevalence of elderly with dementia was 16.72%. Depression was the most prevalent (42.50%) among the morbidities, followed by hypertension (31.71%). The following were independently associated with dementia: vitamin D (OR = 0.92, 95%CI, 0.88;0.97), depression (OR = 4.09, 95%CI, 1.87;8.94), hypertension (OR = 2.65, 95%CI, 1.15;6.08) and individuals aged 80 years and over (OR = 3.97 95%CI, 1.59;9.91). Dementia prevalence was high and diagnosed dementia was associated with lower levels of vitamin D. Vitamin D is a modifiable factor, opening up essential perspectives for public health policies.
