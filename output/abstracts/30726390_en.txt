Technologies can be promoters of breastfeeding. The scope of this review is therefore to identify health technologies and their contribution to the promotion of breastfeeding. A search was conducted in the following databases: Lilacs, SCOPUS, Medline and CINAHL, using the key words 'breastfeeding,' 'technology' and 'health promotion.' The final sample consisted of 24 original articles, among which 19 technologies were identified and classified in managerial, educational and healthcare groupings. Educational technologies were predominant (12) and presented greater contributions to the promotion of breastfeeding. The combination of different technologies has revealed positive results in maintaining breastfeeding. The lack of studies with the use of managerial technologies during the lactation process, as well as the development of other research that prove the effects of each technology on increasing the prevalence of breastfeeding, was clearly detected in the review.
