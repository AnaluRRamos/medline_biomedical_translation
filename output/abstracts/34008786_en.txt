The article analyzes the coordination of information and clinical management between levels of care in physicians' experience and explores related labor and organizational factors and attitudes towards the work and interaction. This is a cross-sectional study with application of the COORDENA-BR questionnaire to a sample of 64 primary health care (PHC) physicians and 56 specialized care (SC) from the public system in a medium-sized Brazilian city. The results show limited linkage of care in the Healthcare Network (RAS), with differences between PHC and SC. There is no exchange of information on diagnosis, treatment, or tests. Physicians in PHC agree more on the treatments prescribed by the specialists than vice versa, but repetition of tests is not frequent. PHC physicians refer patients to SC when necessary. Most medical specialists do not refer patients for follow-up consultations in PHC when necessary and do not give orientation to PHC physicians, who in turn fail to resolve their doubts with SC. Both PHC and specialties report long waiting times for specialist consultations. Temporary employment contracts are more common in PHC. Consultation time was considered too short for coordination between the two. Most physicians do not plan to change jobs, despite their heavy dissatisfaction with wages and work. Physicians do not know each other personally, and specialists do not identify physicians in PHC as the coordinators of care. Policies and measures to guarantee structural conditions to improve access, working conditions, and more favorable mutual adaptation need to be implemented systemically to the set of services in the Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS).
