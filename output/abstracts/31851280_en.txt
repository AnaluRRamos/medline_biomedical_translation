To identify the quality evaluation of Primary Healthcare services in the literature from the perspective of child caregivers through applying the PCATool, children's version. An integrative review performed in the MEDLINE, CINAHL, LILACS, BDENF and Web of Science databases. Seventeen (17) articles were selected. All included studies were descriptive (100%) and had evidence level IV (100%). The affiliation degree component (average = 7.72) of the longitudinality attribute, the utilization component (average = 7.14) of the first contact access attribute, and the information system component (average = 6.63) of the coordination attribute presented high average scores (â‰¥6.6), while the other attributes and components obtained low average scores (<6.6). Although management of Primary Healthcare services has consistently applied efforts to improve their performance and quality in providing and delivering care to the population, it has been observed that problems related to the process and structure of these services still persist given that most of the attributes were poorly evaluated.
