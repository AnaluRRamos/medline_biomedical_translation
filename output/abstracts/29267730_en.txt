The use of dental services on a regular basis by residents of Montes Claros (MG) was assessed, as well as related aspects. Cross-sectional study was conducted with a complex probabilistic sample by conglomerates. Logistic regression was used (OR/CI95%) with a significance level of 5. Of the 2582 study participants, 761 required and obtained access to the services for less than a year. Of these, 262 (35.8%) used the services in a regular/routine manner. The use of dental services on a regular basis was greatest among individuals in the age group '≥ 18 ≤ 37'; with schooling 'equal to or greater than 9 years'; who classified their oral health, general health and appearance of teeth and gums as 'excellent/good'; who reported no pain' on teeth and gums over the last six months; They reported that the 'assistance provider had adequate skills'; that they 'always/often' received information about oral hygiene and diet/nutrition. In addition, this use was lower among those who rated the time to ask questions about the dental problem or treatment as 'regular/bad/terrible.' The conclusion drawn is that the use of dental services on a regular basis was relatively low, being associated with personal traits, subjective health conditions and characteristics related to the services.
