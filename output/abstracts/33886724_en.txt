It is suggested that serglycin has important functions in fibrin stabilization and inflammation but there is limited information on its clinical value for atherosclerotic heart disease. The purpose of this study is to find out serum serglycin levels in acute myocardial infarction patients and in the control group individuals; and to investigate the association between serglycin levels with inflammation markers and infarct size markers. The study population consisted of 75 patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and 57 patients with normal coronary arteries (NCA) (control group). Patient characteristics, serum serglycin levels, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels, peak troponin T levels and other biochemical parameters were recorded. A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. The control group consisted of individuals who are younger and smoke less than those of the STEMI group. The number of females in the control group was higher than in the STEMI group. Serum serglycin levels were significantly higher in the STEMI group than in control group (102.81±39.42 vs. 57.13±32.25, p<0.001). Correlation analyses revealed a significant positive correlation between serglycin and troponin (Spearman's Rho: 0.419; p<0.001) and between serglycin and hs CRP (Spearman's Rho: 0.336; p<0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that serum serglycin levels were independently associated with STEMI. Using a cutoff level of 80,47 μg/L, the serglycin level predicted the presence of STEMI with a sensitivity of 75.7% and specificity of 68.4%. Serum serglycin levels were significantly higher in the STEMI group than in the control group. Serum serglycin levels were positively correlated with both hs CRP levels and troponin levels.
