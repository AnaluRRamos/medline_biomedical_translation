The scope of this article is to analyze the prevalence of polymedication and excessive polypharmacy, as well as associated factors, among the elderly attended at two Basic Health Units in Belo Horizonte, State of Minas Gerais. A cross-sectional observational study was conducted using information obtained from a structured interview of the patient. The individual associations of each explanatory variable with polypharmacy and with excessive polypharmacy were analyzed. For the variables that showed a significant association with polypharmacy, multivariate analysis was performed using the logistic regression model. The elderly used, on average, 5.2 drugs. The prevalence of polymedication was 57.7% and excessive polypharmacy was 4.8%. In univariate analysis the conditions associated with polypharmacy were: age ≤ 70 years, schooling > 8 years, presence of more than three diseases and presenting symptoms of depression. For excessive polypharmacy, the presence of more than three diseases, self-perception of negative health, and partial dependence on instrumental activities of daily living were associated with the conditions. In the final multivariate model for polypharmacy, the age ≤ 70 years and presence of more than three disease variables remained.
