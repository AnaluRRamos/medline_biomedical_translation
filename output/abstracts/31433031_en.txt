This study aimed to analyze the presence of basic sanitation services in households with children under five years of age located in urban areas of Brazil, with a focus on indigenous children. This cross-sectional study was based on data from the 2010 Population Census. We calculated the rates of households with running water (public system), sewage disposal (public system or septic tanks), and garbage collection (directly or via public dumpsters). Multiple logistic regression (MLR) models were used to estimate associations between color/race and presence of sanitation services, based on odds ratios (OR). The study considered Brazil's urban metropolitan areas and stratified the results by major geographic region. Significance was set at 5%. The lowest frequencies were for sewage disposal, and all the rates were lower for indigenous people. MLR analyses included 29 comparisons (48.3%) in which households with indigenous children (compared to other color/race categories) were at a disadvantage, especially in the South of Brazil, where all comparisons were negative for indigenous households. Similar results appeared in metropolitan areas. The results thus suggest inequalities basic sanitation services based on color/race, where indigenous people are generally at a disadvantage, especially in the South of Brazil. Given the relationship between sanitation and health, as already demonstrated in the literature, these results can partly explain the low health levels in indigenous children in Brazil.
