This study aims to analyze the association between social inequalities and gestational risk in administrative regions of the state of Espírito Santo. This is a cross-sectional study based on two administrative regions of the state of Espírito Santo. The sample consisted of 1,777 women who underwent prenatal care in the municipalities of the Greater Vitória Metropolitan Region (RMGV-ES) and São Mateus Microregion (MRSM) and were admitted to the public health facilities at the time of delivery between 2010 and 2012/2013. The multivariate logistic regression was performed to test the association between social and gestational risk variables. Variables with a significance level < 0.20 in the Chi-square test were adopted for the final model, and only those variables with a p-value < 0.05 remained. An association was found between high gestational risk and women's dwelling place in the RMGV-ES (OR = 1.74; CI95% 1.32-2.28), women as head of households (OR = 3.03; CI95% 1.64-5.61), head of household with less than five years of schooling (OR = 1.58; CI95% 1.14-2.20) and receipt of social benefit 'Bolsa Família' (Family Grant) (OR = 1.46; CI95% 1.04-2.03). While some social variables underpin the classification of gestational risk, other social factors have been shown to produce this risk.
