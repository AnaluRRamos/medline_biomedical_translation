Individuals with severe hypercholesterolemia are at a high risk of developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Many of them have familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). To assess from a patient perspective the degree of awareness about severe hypercholesterolemia, especially FH, ASCVD risk perception, cascade screening performance, and treatment of individuals participating in a routine health evaluation program. From a database of 70,000 Brazilian individuals evaluated between 2006 and 2016, 1,987 (2.8%) met the inclusion criteria (age ≥ 18 years and LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL or ≥ 160 mg/dL, respectively, if not in use of statins or on statin therapy). Two-hundred individuals were randomly invited to complete an extensive questionnaire. FH was diagnosed if suspected by the attending physician. Although 97% of the sample (age 48±9 years; 16% women; 95% college/university education; 88% primary prevention; LDL-C 209±47 mg/dL) had severe hypercholesterolemia, only 18% and 29.5% believed to be at high ASCVD risk and reported knowledge of their recommended LDL-C goal, respectively. Fifty-eight percent reported being informed that high cholesterol could be a family disease, 24.5% (n = 49) had ever heard about FH, and merely 14% (n = 29) had been previously identified as suspected of having FH (age at FH diagnosis 35±12 years; 79% and 31% diagnosed, respectively, > 30 and > 40 years old). Only 2.5% underwent genetic tests, 17% underwent cascade screening, and 17% were not in use of pharmacological treatment. An important gap in risk perception, cholesterol management, and aspects related to FH was encountered in individuals with severe hypercholesterolemia.
