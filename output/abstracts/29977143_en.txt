The arcade of the flexor digitorum superficialis muscle (FDS) is an anatomical structure which has not yet been widely studied and is a site of nerve compression. The aim of this study was to analyze the arcade of the FDS muscle and its relations with the median and anterior interosseous nerves through anatomic dissections. Fifty arms from 25 adult cadavers (21 males and 4 females) were dissected; 18 were previously preserved in formalin and glycerin and 7 fresh specimens were dissected in the Laboratory of Anatomy. The arcade of the superficial flexor muscle was identified in all dissected limbs. The radial and humeral heads were present in all specimens, and the ulnar head in 16 (32%). We identified two varieties of the arcade structure: a fibrous arcade in 32 specimens (64%), and a muscular arcade in 11 specimens (22%). In 4 specimens (8%) the arcade was very fine and so transparent that the nerve could be seen within the arcade. In 3 forearms the arcade was considered irregular because of discontinuity between the fibers that comprised this structure. The fibrous arcade of the FDS muscle may be a potential cause of nerve compression of the median and interosseous anterior nerves. Level of Evidence IV; Case series.
