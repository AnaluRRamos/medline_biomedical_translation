To analyze association between patterns of food intake markers and high blood pressure levels among Brazilians. This was a cross-sectional study using National Health Survey data. Its outcome was high blood pressure levels, measured during interviews between August and November 2013. Food intake marker patterns were identified. These were the exposure variables. Prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated using multivariate Poisson regression. High blood pressure prevalence was 16.0% (95%CI - 15.3;16.7) in the sample of 37,216 participants. It was higher in those with a diet that included meat and alcoholic beverages (PR=1.21 - 95%CI 1.08;1.35). The pattern with greater presence of greens and vegetables did not show statistically significant association with high blood pressure levels (PR=0.94 - 95%CI 0.84;1.06). The pattern marked by meat and alcoholic beverages was associated with high blood pressure levels.
