In the past it was taught that local anesthetic should not be used with adrenaline for procedures in the extremities. This dogma is transmitted from generation to generation. Its truth has not been questioned, nor the source of the doubt. In many situations the benefit of use was not understood, because it was often thought that it was not necessary to prolong the anesthetic effect, since the procedures were mostly of short duration. After the disclosure of studies of Canadian surgeons, came to understand that the benefits went beyond the time of anesthesia. The WALANT technique allows a surgical field without bleeding, possibility of information exchange with the patient during the procedure, reduction of waste material, reduction of costs, and improvement of safety. Thus, after passing through the initial phase of the doubts in the use of this technique, the authors verified its benefits and the patients' satisfaction in being able to immediately return home after the procedures.
