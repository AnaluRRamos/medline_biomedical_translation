The objective was to assess the availability of inputs for reproductive planning in basic healthcare units (UBS in Portuguese) that participated in the National Program for Improvement of Access and Quality of Basic Care (PMAQ-AB) and their distribution according to contextual factors. A comparative study was conducted of the three cycles of the PMAQ-AB (2012, 2014, and 2018). The study assessed the availability in the UBS of ethynyl-estradiol + levonorgestrel, norethisterone, norethisterone + estradiol, levonorgestrel, medroxyprogesterone, male and female condoms, IUDs, and rapid pregnancy tests. The study considered the availability and presence of all the inputs. Availability was assessed according to contextual factors in the city where the UBS was located. Availability of total inputs increased from 1.5% to 10.9%. In all the cycles, ethynyl-estradiol + levonorgestrel and male condoms showed the highest availability, and IUDs the lowest. Individual input´s availability also increased, with the highest increase of 36p.p. for female condoms, rapid pregnancy tests, and norethisterone + estradiol and the lowest of 15p.p. for ethynyl-estradiol + levonorgestrel, norethisterone, and IUDs. The North of Brazil showed the worst results. The largest increases were in the UBS in the municipalities with the lowest HDI and in those that participated in all the cycles of the PMAQ. Condoms are the only widely available inputs, and it is important to expand the availability of the other inputs, mainly IUDs and rapid pregnancy tests. The period under study experienced the promotion of equity, but regional inequalities need to be overcome. It is essential to monitor the inputs´ availability in order to improve reproductive planning.
