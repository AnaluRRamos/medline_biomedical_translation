The Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly with the Proxy (IQCODE) was developed as a screening tool for cognition alterations. 1) To verify the applicability of IQCODE in the elderly with limited schooling,2) To verify the reliability of the responses supplied by the aged and their proxies. Individuals of a Community Group were evaluated using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), IQCODE and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). The IQCODE was applied to informants and proxies. We analyzed 44 individuals, aged between 58-82 years (M=66.8, SD=5.97) with mean elderly-schooling level of 3.75, SD=2.82 and 44 proxies aged 44.5 (SD=13.3), with mean schooling level of 8.25 (SD=4.3). The mean GDS was 8.22, SD=4.90 and 13 participants presented a score suggestive of depressive symptoms. The mean elderly IQCODE score was 3.26, SD=0.69 and 3.21, SD=0.65, for proxy responses. There was no statistical difference between these means. On the MMSE, the mean score was 24.20, SD=4.14 and 18 participants presented scores below the cut-off. The IQCODE answers by the elderly in this latter group were more congruent with MMSE than the answers of proxies. The applicability of the IQCODE in a population with little schooling was verified in that the proxy-report was similar to the elderly report. We can affirm that the elderly answers were more accurate than the proxies, as they were closer to MMSE score. The inclusion of a greater number of participants from community-dwelling settings is necessary to confirm the results obtained in this study.
