to assess clinical and epidemiological factors of patients undergoing video cholecystectomy at the Hospital da Cruz Vermelha do Paran√°, Curitiba unit, operated from September 2016 to September 2018, as well as the influence of comorbidities, sex and advanced age on the postoperative prognosis, while in the hospital. Analytic retrospective study. The analyzed variables were obtained by the review of medical records. Statistical analyses were performed considering the significance level p < 0.05. 389 patients, of whom 265 were women and 124 men, were included. The mean age was 51.5 years, 58.8% of the patients were diagnosed with at least one comorbidity, and 74.6% were overweight or obese. The incidence of intraoperative complications was 1.3%, postoperative 3.8% and, mortality, 0.3%. Some risk factors were identified as worse postoperative prognosis, such as Diabetes Mellitus, hypertension, presence of one or more comorbidities and mainly, advanced age, which was related to longer hospitalization times (p < 0,001), need of intensive therapy (p < 0,001), conversion to open surgery (p = 0,003) and postoperative complications (p < 0,001). Furthermore, the male sex was predictive of longer hospitalization times (p = 0,003) and need of intensive therapy (p = 0,01). the presence of comorbidities, male sex, and advanced age are predictive factors of bad prognosis for patients undergoing video laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
