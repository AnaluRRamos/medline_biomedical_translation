To describe the epidemiological aspects of an outbreak of yellow fever (YF) that occurred in the state of Espírito Santo, Brazil, from 1 January 2017 - 31 July 2017. A descriptive, quantitative, retrospective approach analyzed secondary data obtained from the national notification systems, Information System of Diseases Notifications (SINAN), Laboratory Environment Manager (GAL), and the Espírito Santo Health Secretariat (SESA). From 1 January 2017 - 8 July 2017, a total of 824 cases were reported in Espírito Santo, 307 (37%) of which were confirmed as YF. Of these, 95 (30.9%) died from the disease. Men were those most affected, corresponding to 244 (79.5%) cases, and women to 63 (20.5%) cases. The greatest incidence rate registered was in the city of Santa Leopoldina (380.2 cases/100 000 inhabitants). The outbreak evolved rapidly and a response was possible due to a multidisciplinary group created specifically to tackle the YF outbreak. The data were received and analyzed quickly and the response, consisting of immediate treatment of the cases and a blocking vaccination strategy, was developed to halt the progression of this fatal disease. In spite of these efforts, the case fatality rate of yellow fever remained high.
