There are no liquid oral glucocorticoids labelled for management of pruritus and clinical lesions of feline hypersensitivity dermatitis (feline HD). First, to demonstrate that dexamethasone sodium phosphate (DexSP, DexajectSP, Henry Schein; Dublin, OH, USA; 4 mg/mL), an intravenous glucocorticoid, can be absorbed by healthy cats when administered orally. Second, to demonstrate the efficacy of orally administered DexSP for reducing pruritus and clinical lesions in patients with feline HD. Seven healthy and 12 client-owned cats with HD. Healthy cats were administered a single dose of 0.2 mg/kg DexSP p.o. and serum concentrations were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Feline HD patients were assessed with SCORing Feline Allergic Dermatitis (SCORFAD) and pruritus Visual Analog Scale (pVAS) at Visit 1 (V1) and after 20-31 days of receiving 0.2 mg/kg/day DexSP p.o. (V2). Complete blood cell counts, serum chemistry profile, and urinalysis were performed in 50% of feline HD patients at both visits. Healthy cats had detectable serum concentrations of DexSP following oral administration; concentrations ranged from 0.7 to 92.3 ng/mL. Feline HD patients showed significant decreases in SCORFAD and pVAS scores from V1 to V2. DexSP was absorbed when administered orally to healthy cats and 0.2 mg/kg/day DexSP is an efficacious dose to rapidly improve the pruritus and clinical lesions associated with feline HD.
