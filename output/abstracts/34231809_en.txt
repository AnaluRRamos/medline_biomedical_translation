To characterize the demographic, social, and economic burden of traumatic brain injury on the public health system in Brazil during the past decade. Data from the database of the Information Technology Department of the Unified Health System (DATASUS) from January 2008 to December 2019 were analyzed. There was a mean of 131,014.83 hospital admissions per year due to traumatic brain injury in Brazil from 2008 - 2019. The incidence was 65.54 per 100.000 inhabitants during the same period. The high incidence of traumatic brain injury in older adults (>70 years old) accompanied by high mortality rates should be noted. In addition, there was a high incidence of traumatic brain injury in younger adults (20 to 29 years and 30 to 39 years). The data presented here demonstrates a 3.6 male-to-female ratio of traumatic brain injury incidence. Although we believe that the present data underestimate the incidence and mortality related to traumatic brain injury in Brazil, this study could assist in implementation of future health promotion strategies in the Brazilian population and worldwide aiming to reduce the incidence, mortality and costs of traumatic brain injury.
