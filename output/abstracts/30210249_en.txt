To verify the impact of avascular necrosis of the femoral head on the quality of life of children and adolescents with Perthes disease and sickle cell disease. A comparative study including 24 children between eight and 18 years old with avascular necrosis of the femoral head secondary to Perthes disease and sickle cell disease (Group with Necrosis) and 24 children considered asymptomatic (Group without Necrosis). Clinical and sociodemographic data were collected and the PedsQL 4.0 and the Charnley score for hip dysfunction were applied. There was no difference in the overall score and in any domain when comparing the Perthes group (global = 73.1) and the sickle cell disease group (global = 65.9). When comparing the groups with necrosis and without necrosis, the Perthes group had a lower overall score only for the Physical Functioning domain (87.5 versus 68.5); sickle cell disease group had a lower overall score (64.9 versus 79.4) and in the Physical Functioning (68.5 versus 87.5) and School Functioning (62.9 versus 73.7) domains. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head produces lower quality of life scores both in the global evaluation and in the domains Physical Functioning and School Functioning. Necrosis, bilateral lesion, and hip function were found to be associated with the loss of quality of life. <b><i>Level of Evidence III, Sectional comparative study.</i></b>
