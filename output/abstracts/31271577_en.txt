The present study aimed to analyze the degree of implementation of the national health care policy at the state level. This qualitative evaluation study was carried out in two stages. Firstly, the policy was modelled by means of document analysis and the application of the Delphi technique for consensus among experts. In the second stage, a qualitative, exploratory evaluative research was conducted, designed as a single case study in a Brazilian state through semi-structured interviews with health managers. The experts reached a consensus for a logical model and an evaluation matrix of the policy implementation. The results at the state level evinced an incipient degree of implementation, as the level of government characteristics achieved 45% of the maximum score; management, 41%; and system organization, 33%. The degree of implementation in the state evaluated was classified as incipient. Barriers were identified in the management and organization levels of the system, as well as in the political context.
