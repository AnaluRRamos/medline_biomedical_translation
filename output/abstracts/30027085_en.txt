Fournier's gangrene is a rare, high-mortality infection that affects the subcutaneous tissue with rapidly progressive necrosis. The objective is to report a case of Fournier's gangrene involving the region of the shoulder girdle after closed fracture of the clavicle, and to discuss this unusual evolution. The patient underwent a series of surgical procedures and was followed up on an outpatient basis for 12 months, at which point she was discharged. Fournier's gangrene is an aggressive lesion and requires early diagnosis (clinical-laboratory correlation) with the appropriate adequate surgical approach and clinical stabilization.
