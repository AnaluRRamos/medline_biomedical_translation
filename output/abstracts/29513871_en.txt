Describe and correlate bulbar functionality with laryngeal penetration and/or laryngotracheal aspiration for different food consistencies in Motor Neuron Disease (MND). Study participants were 18 individuals diagnosed with MND regardless of the type and time of onset of disease. The Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale - Revised/BR (ALSFRS-R/BR) was applied, and only the bulbar parameter, which includes speech, salivation and swallowing, was analyzed, with scores raging from 0 (disability) to 12 (normal functionality). Swallowing videofluoroscopy was performed using the Penetration-Aspiration Scale (PAS) described by Rosenbek et al. (1996). The Pearson correlation test was used for data analysis. According to food consistency, the PAS level ranged from 1 to 5 for puree consistency, 1 to 4 for thickened liquid, and 1 to 3 for liquid, and no laryngotracheal aspiration was observed. Negative correlation between bulbar functionality and laryngeal penetration was observed for all food consistencies (pasty: r=-0.487, p=0.041; thickened liquid: r=-0.442, p=0.076; liquid r=0.460, p=0.073), but statistically significant difference was found only for the puree consistency, that is, individuals with poor bulbar functionality presented higher levels of laryngeal penetration. Negative correlation was observed between bulbar functionality and laryngeal penetration in MND. The bulbar parameters of the ALSFRS-R/BR are significant for predicting risk of laryngotracheal aspiration for pasty consistency in MND.
