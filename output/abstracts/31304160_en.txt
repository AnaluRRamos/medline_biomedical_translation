This paper performs a dimensional analysis of different total hip arthroplasty polyethylenes, cemented and non-cemented, Brazilian made and imported. It was considered acetabular components with 50 mm for the 28 mm femoral heads. Dimensional analysis was performed on a 3D coordinate Carl-Zeiss robotic device. Polyethylene thickness and its external measurements (maximum diameter and diameter for the femoral head) were measured. The minimum thickness of the polyethylene was guaranteed on all tested components. The thickness of cemented acetabular varied from 19.185 mm to 25.358 mm, while the thickness of the non-cemented acetabular varied from 12.451 mm to 19.232 mm. The thickness was 27.96% lower in non-cemented acetabular components. With respect to the polyethylene acetabular cavity that receives the femoral head, all internal diameters exhibit at least 28 mm. In relation to the maximum outer diameter of the polyethylene, only one cemented acetabular component reached 50 mm in diameter. There are large differences in measurements between brands and models analyzed. Cementless acetabular components have the smaller thickness. The diameters of non-cemented acetabular were also lower than those cemented at the expense of their need to insert into the metal-back.
