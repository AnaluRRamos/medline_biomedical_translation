The scope of this study was to analyze the association between ultra-processed food (UPF) consumption and lipid parameters. It was a cross-sectional study performed with high school adolescents. Food consumption was analyzed by means of a 24-hour food recall form, where UPF were identified in line with the NOVA system of food classification. The total cholesterol levels, HDL-c and triglycerides were determined by enzymatic colorimetry and the LDL-c fraction estimated by formula. The Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney was used to compare averages, and linear regression to make associations among the variables. The results show that UPF consumption was more frequent in female adolescents between 17 and 19 years of age, with a family income above two minimum wages and from private schools. It was observed that individuals in the upper third of UPF consumption had a higher energetic, carbohydrate and sodium intake, with a lower intake of proteins and fibers. Moreover, it was found that a higher UPF intake was negatively associated with HDL-c levels and positively associated with triglyceride levels and dyslipidemia. Therefore, UPF is associated with a worsening of the nutritional profile of the diet and contributes to negative changes in the lipid parameters of young individuals.
