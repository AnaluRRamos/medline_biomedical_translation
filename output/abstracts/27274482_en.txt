To evaluate double-bundle reconstruction of the medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) using a graft from the semitendinosus tendon and fixation with metal anchors over the medium term. This was a prospective cross-sectional study. After approval from the research ethics committee, 31 patients with patellofemoral instability who underwent MPFL reconstruction by means of the anatomical double-bundle technique, with fixation using metal anchors, were analyzed between May 2010 and January 2015. To evaluate the effectiveness of the MPFL reconstruction surgery, the Kujala scale and the Tegner-Lysholm score were assessed before the procedure and one year afterwards, along with clinical data such as pain levels, range of motion and J sign. The data were tabulated in the Excel(®) software and were analyzed using the SPSS Statistics(®) software, version 21. The statistical analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon T test and the McNemar test. The mean preoperative score from the Kujala test was 45.64 ± 1.24 and the postoperative score was 94.03 ± 0.79 (p < 0.001). The preoperative Tegner-Lysholm score was 40.51 ± 1.61 and the postoperative score was 91.64 ± 0.79 (p < 0.001). The preoperative range of motion was 125.96 ± 2.11 and the postoperative range was 138.38 ± 1.49 (p < 0.05). MPFL reconstruction by means of the anatomical double-bundle technique is easily reproducible, without episodes of recurrence, with satisfactory results regarding restoration of stability and function of the patellofemoral joint.
