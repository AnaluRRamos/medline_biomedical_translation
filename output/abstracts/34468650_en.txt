This study aimed to evaluate the risk of HIV infection in men who have sex with men (MSM) by developing an index that considers sex partner networks. The index variables were age, ethnicity/skin color, schooling, relationship type, condom use in receptive and insertive relationships, self-perception of the possibility of HIV infection, sexually transmitted infections, and rapid HIV testing results. We used data from a cross-sectional MSM egocentric network survey conducted in Rio de Janeiro between 2014 and 2015. The initial research volunteer is called ego, each partner is called alter, and each pair of people in a relationship is called the dyad. Multiple logistic regression was used to define the coefficients of the equations for the elaboration of the indices. The index ranged from 0 to 1; the closer to 1, the higher the risk of HIV infection. HIV prevalence was 13.9% among egos. The mean egos index with an HIV-reactive test was 57% higher than non-reactive, and the same profile was observed in the index values of dyads. The index allowed the incorporation of network data through the dyads and contributed to the identification of individuals with a higher likelihood of acquiring HIV.
