To report a case series of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in the foot, describing previous risk factors, surgical treatment, histopathological findings, and functional and oncological results. Nine consecutive patients diagnosed with SCC of the foot were treated at a single institution and prospectively analyzed for risk factors related to the disease, surgical outcome, and histopathological, functional and oncological results. All patients had identifiable risk factors for SCC. Definitive treatment consisted of partial (6 patients) or total (3 patients) amputation of the foot. The functional score was good or excellent in the surviving patients. Early identifiable risk factors are present in most patients. Biopsy when this diagnosis is suspected, in association with oncological principles, avoids diagnostic and treatment errors. Despite delayed diagnosis and surgical treatment with partial and total amputations of the foot in our series, we observed good oncological outcomes that avoided systemic spread of the disease and achieved expected functional results. Level of Evidence V; Case series.
