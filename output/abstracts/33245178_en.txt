Atopic dermatitis (AD) is considered to be a systemic disease in people shown to have an association with epilepsy. However, so far, no data about the association of epilepsy and atopy have been reported in dogs. Given the homology between human and canine AD, and the increased incidence of epilepsy in atopic people, we investigated the association between AD and seizure-associated activity in a small canine population. We included 34 atopic dogs and 34 breed- and age range-matched nonatopic dogs. We investigated the association between canine AD and signs of seizures in a retrospective, breed- and age range-matched, case-controlled study. Dog owners were interviewed using a standardized questionnaire. The presence or absence of signs of seizure activity and possible comorbidities were questioned. Seven of the 34 atopic dogs also suffered from seizure activity. By contrast, only one dog affected with seizure signs could be identified among the 34 nonatopic dogs. Atopic dermatitis was associated with a higher frequency of seizure activity (McNemar test, P = 0.035; one-sided) and atopic dogs had a higher odds ratio to develop seizures [(95% CI) 7 (0.9-56.9)] compared to the age- and breed-matched nonatopic control group. No other comorbidities were detected. In our small retrospective study, we observed an increased prevalence of seizure activity in the atopic dog population. Further larger and prospective studies are needed to confirm these results.
