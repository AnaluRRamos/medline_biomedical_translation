Sexuality is a silent theme concerning the elderly population who is socially perceived as asexual. This qualitative approach paper is part of research on dependent older adults, which aimed to analyze their sexual experiences. The topic was retrieved from interviews with 26 of them, who talked about sex in their lives. The Thematic content analysis identified two main categories in the statements: gender differences in the treatment of sexuality and difficulty in talking about sex. Differences were observed in the perception and valuation of sexuality by gender. Older men give importance to sexual potency, and older women consider the cessation of sexual life in old age to be natural. Older men enunciate a sexuality concept based on biological satisfaction and sexual act, while women value partnership, affection, and fondness. Researchers were silent on the topic, although it was included in the research manual to guide the interview with older adults. However, while only 26 mentioned the subject, sexuality of older adults is modulated by gender perception. It is a poorly studied and challenging theme to approach in research and healthcare settings.
