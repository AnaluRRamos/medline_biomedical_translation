The aim of this study was to assess the influence of different pre-treatment approaches on glass ionomer cement (GIC) bond strength (BS) to dentine. Sixty bovine incisors were allocated into six groups according to substrate - sound or caries-affected dentine; and substrate pre-treatment approach - no conditioning (control), polyacrylic acid for 10 s and phosphoric acid for 7 s. Teeth in the caries-affected dentine group were previously submitted to cariogenic pH-cycling challenge. After dentine pre-treatment, according to experimental groups, polyethylene tubes were placed on flat dentine surfaces and filled with GIC. Teeth were stored in distilled water for 24 h at 37 °C and then submitted to microshear test (0.5 mm/min). Failure pattern analysis was performed under stereomicroscope (400x). Data were analysed using two-way ANOVA and Tukey's test (α=5%). Statistically significant differences were found for the pre-treatment approach, regardless of substrate (p<0.001). The polyacrylic acid group and control group had similar BS values, and were both better than the phosphoric acid group. In general, GIC had better bonding performance in sound dentine than in caries-affected dentine. In conclusion, dentine pre-treatment with polyacrylic acid did not improve the performance of GIC restoration on clinically relevant substrates.
