This correlational study aimed to verify the association between maternal variables and exclusive breastfeeding in a specialized outpatient clinic in the state of Cear√°, Brazil. The practice of exclusive breastfeeding was observed, showing a decrease during the first six months of a child's life. Most women were young, with partners, with a good level of schooling, multigravidas and had six or fewer antenatal consultations in health centers. There was a significant association between multiparity and exclusive breastfeeding variables, showing up as a protective variable for this practice. Most women who breastfed exclusively said they had not received guidance on breastfeeding during prenatal care, which evidences the existence of other external factors that are favorable to exclusive breastfeeding.
