To analyze the results obtained with a modified antegrade double J catheter insertion (JJ stenting) technique in patients with urinary tract obstruction due to malignancy. This was a retrospective analysis of data collected from patients undergoing antegrade JJ stenting for malignant ureteral obstruction in the interventional radiology department of our institution between March 1, 2017 and May 31, 2019. Antegrade JJ stenting was performed in 32 patients (20 women and 12 men). The mean age was 66.2 years among the females and 61.5 years among the males. A total of 53 antegrade JJ stenting procedures were performed. The procedure was successful in 50 cases and failed in 3 (due to migration of the double J catheter in 2 and due to technical failure in 1). Complications occurred in 3 patients (low back pain, in 1, subcapsular hematoma, in 1, and pyelonephritis, in 1). The procedure time ranged from 14 min to 55 min. In patients with ureteral obstruction due to malignancy, antegrade JJ stenting is safe and effective. The technique selected in our study is easily reproduced and can be performed by a trained professional.
