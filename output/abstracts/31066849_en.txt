The 'Age-Friendly Cities' project was developed by the World Health Organization to address two contemporary issues of increasing relevance: urbanization and demographic ageing. The Checklist of Essential Features of Age-Friendly Cities that stemmed from this project is a tool designed for a city's self-assessment, comprising eight dimensions of urban living associated with active ageing. This study aims to adapt the Checklist as a quantitative assessment tool, evaluate the level of Coimbra's 'Age-Friendliness' and analyze the relation between the Checklists' eight dimensions and quality of life (QoL). A personal data questionnaire, the adapted Checklist and WHOQOL-Bref were applied to a non-probabilistic sample of 215 elderly Coimbra dwellers aged between 60 and 90 years old. The adapted Checklist evidenced good psychometric properties, although it was perceived by the respondents as difficult to complete. 'Community and Health Services' and 'Social Participation' obtained the highest satisfaction rates; 'Housing' and 'Civic Participation and Employment' the lowest; 'Community and Health Services' and 'Housing' had the strongest correlations with QoL, flagging important areas of improvement.
