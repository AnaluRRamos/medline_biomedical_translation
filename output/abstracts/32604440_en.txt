Cellular angiofibroma (CA)is a rare benign mesenchymal tumor. In women, it occurs mainly in the vulvovaginal region, with vulvar location in 70% of the cases. Its clinical presentation is nonspecific and similar to several other vulvar tumors of different cellular origins. Thus, its histological and immunohistochemical features allow distinction from other tumors. Cellular angiofibromas have good prognosis, despite some risk of relapse. The authors present the case of a 49-year-old woman with a bulky right vulvar lesion, for which the preoperative diagnosis was a Bartholin cyst, but the histological and immunohistochemical evaluation yielded a CA.
