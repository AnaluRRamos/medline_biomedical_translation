The main goal of this study was to measure the sound pressure level of digital audio players of high school students and investigate their auditory and non-auditory complaints, and their hearing habits. Another goal was to consider the concern with hearing health and the knowledge sources used by young people to gather information about the subject. This is an observational, descriptive, quantitative, and cross-sectional study, which had the participation of high school students. The first step was an examination of transient-evoked optoacoustic emissions, followed by the application of a questionnaire and the measurement of the volume of audio players. The results showed harmful habits of young people regarding hearing health, such as an excessive time of use (hours, days and years) and high volume levels of digital audio players (DAPs), as well as symptoms that may point to hearing loss. It was found that most young people seem to be concerned about their hearing; however, there is no change of attitude to such situations. The students develop the habit of using DAPs at very early ages and, in many cases, this habit is practiced with the equipment operating at high intensities, which can cause several hearing losses in these students.
