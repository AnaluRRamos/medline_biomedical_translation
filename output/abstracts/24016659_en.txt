Eccrine porocarcinoma is an uncommon malignant adnexal tumor of the skin. Eccrine porocarcinoma is an adenocarcinoma of the eccrine sweat gland with a propensity to recur locally and gives metastases to regional lymph nodes. This paper presents a cytologic diagnosis by fine needle aspiration of an eccrine porocarcinoma along with histopathology and immunocyto-histochemistry. The cytologic findings of an eccrine porocarcinoma in a 76-year-old female and histologic features of the skin tumor are reported. Cytologically in fine needle aspiration biopsy, the tumor was characterized by atypical malignant cells with basophilic cytoplasm, hyperchromatic nuclei and prominent nucleoli. The cytologic diagnosis was confirmed by histology. The accurate preoperative diagnosis of eccrine porocarcinoma is crucial to developing a curative surgical plan. Fine needle aspiration cytology provides a convenient, safe and effective approach to solving a challenging differential diagnosis.
