To verify the accuracy of the defining characteristics of the situational low self-esteem nursing diagnosis in people with an ostomy. A cross-sectional and descriptive study developed in two stages. The first stage was performed with 90 people with an ostomy, and a descriptive analysis of the collected data was performed. In the second phase, diagnostic inference was verified with nursing judges. The situational low self-esteem nursing diagnosis frequency was low (23.3%). Among the defining characteristics, self-deprecating verbalizations (33.3%), indecisive behavior (28.8%) and non-assertive behavior (26.1%) prevailed. The most sensitive were indecisive behavior (71.0%) and expressing feelings of worthlessness (71.0%). It was observed that the situational low self-esteem nursing diagnosis can be identified in people with an ostomy, and that there are defining characteristics in this diagnosis which better predict and increase the chance of its occurrence. In this sense, the importance of nursing care in the adaptation process and self-esteem is emphasized.
