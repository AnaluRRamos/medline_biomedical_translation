To describe the results of a virtual and in-person accompaniment strategy based on person-centered care of patients hospitalized for suspected or confirmed disease due to the novel 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19). Retrospective descriptive observational study conducted in five health facilities of the Colsanitas clinic network that implemented an accompaniment strategy with seven modalities: virtual information, personal mobile devices, virtual visits, contacts by other means, round-the-clock companion, in-person visit, and compassionate contact. Descriptive statistics were used for data analysis. The accompaniment strategy was used with 871 patients with hospital stays ranging from 1 to 90 days; 70% were positive for COVID-19. The families of 764 patients were contacted through 3984 calls in the virtual information modality; an average of 71 virtual visits per day occurred; 428 letters, voice messages, and videos, among others, were received; 114 patients had a round-the-clock companion; 154 patients had an in-person visit; and 20 families made a posthumous in-person visit to the patient. The results of the virtual and in-person accompaniment strategy with a person-centered approach showed that family involvement is important to patient care and improves communication and interaction among patients, families, and the healthcare team.
