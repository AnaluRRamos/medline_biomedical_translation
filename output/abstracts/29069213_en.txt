This research examines the institutional features of Brazil's National Commission for the Implementation of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (CONICQ) and how these institutional features have facilitated and hindered its ability to foster intersectoral tobacco control. In particular, we evaluate the key institutional features of CONICQ starting from when it was one of the key drivers of change and improvements in early tobacco control policies, which helped to make Brazil a world leader in this area. We also examine how the committee has evolved, as tobacco control has improved and particularly elucidate some of the major challenges that it faces to bring together often disparate government sectors to generate public health policies.
