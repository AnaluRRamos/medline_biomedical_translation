Knowledge of environmental and genetic factors for healthy aging in elderly people is controversial. In addition to this evidence, few studies have been designed for this population. To investigate the relationship between the most frequent apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotypes and mortality in very elderly individuals living in a community and to evaluate survival according to cardiovascular risk factors. A sample of 74 elderly individuals aged ≥ 80 years, from the Veranópolis Project cohort, was selected for APOE genotyping. At baseline, anthropometric variables, glucose and lipid levels, blood pressure, and lifestyle variables (smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity) were collected. The Bayer Activities of Daily Living Scale was applied to their caregivers. Total study follow-up was 21 years. Two-sided p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. There was no association between APOE genotypes and mortality. However, the risk of death in elderly smokers was 2.30 times higher (hazard ratio [HR], 95% CI 1.01 to 5.24); in individuals with diabetes, it was 3.95 times higher (HR, 95% CI 1.27 to 12.30) than in individuals without diabetes. Subjects who practiced vigorous physical activity had a 51% reduction in risk of death (HR = 0.49, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.88). For an increase of 1 mmHg in systolic blood pressure, there was a 2% reduction (HR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.97 to 0.99) in risk of death. In this sample population, APOE genotypes were not associated with mortality. However, classic cardiovascular risk factors may be important for overall mortality in the very elderly.
