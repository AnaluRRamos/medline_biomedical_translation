to investigate the effectiveness of an intervention proposal based on shared story reading for reading comprehension, written narrative and word reading/writing. 44 children were divided into two groups according to their performance in a reading comprehension test - The first group, G1, consisted of children with reading comprehension difficulty, and the second, G2, consisted of children who did not have difficulties. All children were evaluated regarding reading/writing isolated words, reading comprehension of sentences, and written narrative. After this evaluation, G1 children participated in an intervention program (15 meetings) that stimulated shared story reading. After this intervention, all children were reevaluated. Intra- and intergroup data were analyzed statistically by applying appropriate statistical tests, with the level of significance set at >0.05%. after the intervention program, G1 children showed significant improvement in the variables evaluated. In the intergroup analysis, at the time of evaluation, G1 differed from G2 in reading/writing, reading comprehension, ability to correctly judge the verbs, and in textual coherence. At reassessment, G1 matched G2 in textual coherence and approached G2 in reading/writing isolated words and reading comprehension. shared story reading promoted the development of low and high level reading and writing skills, being more effective for high-level strategies (example: written narrative). It is suggested that a specific program for orthographic questions be associated.
