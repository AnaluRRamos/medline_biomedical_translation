Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common primary malignant liver tumour and is a leading cause of death worldwide. Despite the advent of screening programmes, most cases of hepatocellular carcinoma are diagnosed late (in an advanced stage) which precludes curative treatments such as surgery and ablation. Therefore, intra-arterial locoregional treatments now play a central role in the management of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, such treatments ranging from trans-arterial chemo-embolisation to the more recently developed trans-arterial radio-embolisation technique. In this essay, we discuss the state of the art of intra-arterial treatment for locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and the future directions for such treatment.
