The study analyzed the initiatives of prevention and control of childhood obesity, especially those of Adequate and Healthy Food Promotion (PAAS) which have been part of the policies of the Brazilian federal government for the last 15 years. All documents that feature PAAS initiatives in the food and nutrition security, as well as public health policy fields, were evaluated according to the following criteria: (1) the approach to PAAS initiatives; (2) the aspects of obesitythat they intend to affect and (3) potential interest disputes. The main PAAS initiatives identified are intended to encourage: food and nutrition education; agroecological production systems; family agriculture; food accessibility; healthy environments and regulatory measures. These initiatives alter different aspects of childhood obesityand highlight different conceptions about the problem and affect different interests. We highlight the disputes between the interests of the processed foods and agribusiness corporations, and the governmental and corporate sectors guided by PAAS objectives. Measures aimed at regulating purchases and publicizing unhealthy products for children, are those that best express the interests involved.
