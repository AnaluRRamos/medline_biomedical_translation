The aetiology and appropriate treatment for auricular chondritis in the dog are currently unclear. This report describes a unique presentation and successful treatment of a dog with auricular chondritis. A 12-year-old, female spayed, Labrador retriever dog was presented for severe pain thought to be neurological in origin. The pain was located to the right pinna and two punch biopsies were acquired and evaluated, revealing lymphoplasmacytic to pyogranulomatous inflammation involving the auricular cartilage with no infectious agents. Treatment with systemic oral prednisone resulted in resolution of clinical signs within four weeks of initiation of treatment. The dog remained free of clinical signs for six months following discontinuation of treatment before being euthanized for an unrelated reason. Further evaluation of canine auricular chondritis is needed, yet pain may be a prominent finding; monotherapy with systemic prednisone may provide quick and complete resolution of clinical sysmptoms.
