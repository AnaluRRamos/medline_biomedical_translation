When it is necessary to evaluate dental structures, the typical method is to obtain intraoral or panoramic X-rays at specialized dental clinics. However, in the daily practice of head and neck radiology, or even general radiology, it is common to encounter clinical situations or examination findings related to dental problems that should not be ignored. Because such problems can often be responsible for the clinical complaints of patients, this review aims to assist radiologists in identifying and describing common dental conditions on computed tomography of paranasal sinuses, face, and neck. It is important for radiologists to have knowledge of dental arch anatomy and its relationships with facial structures, as well as of major dental pathologies, including periapical sclerotic lesions, odontogenic cysts, fistulas, and abscesses, together with knowledge of incidental findings without clinical repercussions, which should be easily identified and stressed by the radiologist when necessary. The imaging methods most commonly used in evaluation of paranasal sinuses and face are computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Those methods allow radiologists to recognize and become familiar with the main dental findings. The description of such findings by a radiologist can lead to a change in treatment strategy.
