The aim of this study is to analyze the functional outcome following titanium elastic stable intra-medullary nailing (ESIN) for displaced mid-shaft clavicular fractures (DMCF). A retrospective study of 60 patients between March 2009 and March 2015 was conducted. Patients were selected based on the inclusion criteria. Six patients were lost during follow up. Out of the remaining 54 patients, there were 39 males and 15 females. The mean age was 30.6 years. The functional outcome was analyzed using the Constant score, rate of bone union, complication, and earliest time of return to work. All fractures united well, with an average time of 7.5 weeks. Follow-up period ranged between 12 months and 18 months (average, 14 months). 24 out of 54 patients had closed nailing, while 30 had minimal open reduction. The average size of ESIN was 2 mm (range, 1.5-3 mm). The average Constant score was 97.8 (range, 95-99). There were no major complications, but minor complications occurred, viz. skin irritation in 15 patients, temporary paresthesia in five patients, and three patients who developed superficial infections. One case had implant migration and perforation at the lateral cortex, and one case had delayed union. There were few implant-related problems, as the authors used a standard protocol to remove it after radiological union. All patients returned to work within 10 weeks of the post-operative period. ESIN is a safe, minimally invasive, engenders rapid healing with good cosmesis, and provides an excellent functional outcome in terms of patient satisfaction, with fewer complications.
