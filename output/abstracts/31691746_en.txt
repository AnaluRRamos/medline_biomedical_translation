To develop a protocol for the evaluation of acquired speech disorders in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PADAF) and to validate its content and determine its inter-judge reliability. The study was carried out in three stages: in the first one, the protocol was prepared and its content validated through the analysis of seven specialists; in the second, the instrument was applied to 25 individuals with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD); in the third and last stage, the inter-judge reliability was determined. The final version of PADAF consisted of 32 items that evaluated breathing, phonation, resonance, articulation, and prosody. It was shown to be valid, with a content validity index (CVI) much higher than that established in the literature, and with perfect agreement in the determination of inter-judge reliability. PADAF for PD individuals was developed and its content was validated, showing perfect instrument reliability.
