Several measures were suggested to reduce the occurrence of this occupational condition, among which physical exercise at the workplace stands out. To analyze studies which assessed physical exercise at the workplace for treatment of low back pain. The present study consisted of a systematic review with meta-analysis. An electronic search was conducted on database MEDLINE using keywords 'workplace,' 'low back pain' and 'exercise,' synonyms and headings located on Health Sciences Descriptors and Medical Subject Headings. We considered all the studies that included physical exercise at the workplace and defined low back pain as outcome. We located 499 potential studies and finally included 15 for review. The duration of treatment varied from 3 weeks to 18 months, and the main interventions were strength and stretching exercises and muscle relaxation. The meta-analysis showed that physical exercise at the workplace did not reduce the occurrence of low back pain (difference of means=0.62, 95%CI -0.8-2.04, p<0.4). The present systematic review was registered in database PROSPERO, registration number CRD42017071563.
