Planned home birth (PHB) has grown in Brazil, especially in large urban centers, in the face of women's dissatisfaction with the current obstetric system. International studies have demonstrated the security of PHB, but national production about this area is still limited. Thus, this study aimed to review the national bibliographic production about PHB between 2008 and 2018, in order to compile data related to PHB in Brazil. After survey, 18 studies were included in the review, and then subdivided into the following categories: 'Maternal and neonatal outcomes of PHB', 'Feelings, motivation and personal characteristics of women that choose PHB', 'Perception of professionals that practice PHB' and 'Theoretical approach to PHB'. It was concluded that the PHB has grown between privileged portions of Brazilian population, representing the important practice of women's autonomy, presenting itself as a safe alternative place of birth, with a high degree of satisfaction of women and families. However, this model of assistance presents itself as a limited option, since the PHB is not offered by the Health System, still unaccessible to most of women in the country.
