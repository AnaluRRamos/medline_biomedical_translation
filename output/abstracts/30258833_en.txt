Distal ruptures of the biceps are rare when compared to proximal ruptures, with a different epidemiology and mechanism of trauma. There is no exact pathophysiology, though the hypovascular distal insertion and the mechanical impact during movement should be considered important factors. The surgical treatment of chronic cases presents worse prognosis due to muscle shortening with tendon retraction, making anatomical repair of the injury difficult, requiring the use of grafts for its reconstruction. This is a prospective study involving four patients with chronic distal biceps injury. The tendons were reconstructed with an autologous graft from the semitendinosus tendon from the ipsilateral knee and secured to the radial tuberositywith the help of two anchors. The surgical technique proved to be a simple and viable procedure for the reconstruction of chronic ruptures of the distal biceps.
