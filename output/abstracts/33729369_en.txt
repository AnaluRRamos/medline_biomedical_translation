The objective of this article is to analyze the spatial distribution of Hepatitis B vaccine (HBVAC) of pregnant women. This is a cross-sectional study carried with 266 puerperae. The HBVAC record was obtained through the prenatal care booklet. The spatial scanning technique was used to detect a cluster of risk for the presence or absence of an HBVAC record. After this cluster identification, the individual and environmental variables were compared between the Coverage Areas of Basic Health Units (CAs-BHUs). The mean prevalence of non-HBVAC was 88.34%. Scan spatial scan analysis observed a cluster of a high prevalence of puerperae with a HBVAC record. Comparative analyses have shown that paid work and the number of prenatal visits are positively associated with an HBVAC record. Given the above, this work brings a reflection on possible disparities with other CAs-BHUs, besides the influence of the environmental perspective. It should be emphasized that the vaccination situation is influenced not only by factors intrinsic to the individuals. However, in this study, the results indicate that individual variables are predominantly mandatory in the decision of HBVAC uptake among pregnant women.
