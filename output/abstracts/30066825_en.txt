To evaluate the association between family history and the presence of dyslipidemia in children. A cross-sectional study with 257 children aged 4 to 7 years old from Vi√ßosa, Minas Gerais, Southeast Brazil. Nutritional status and lipid profile (total cholesterol, cholesterol fractions, and triglyceride) assessments and an active search for a family history of dyslipidemia in parents were carried out. Pearson's chi-square test was used to identify associations, and Student's t-test was used to compare means. A Poisson regression analysis was performed to assess the independent association between family history and the presence of dyslipidemia in children. A significance level of 5% was adopted. Children of parents with dyslipidemia had higher serum concentrations of total cholesterol and triglycerides. In a regression analysis after adjustments, the presence of dyslipidemia in the father or in the mother (OR: 2.43; 95%CI 1.12-5.27), as well as the presence of dyslipidemia in both the father and the mother (OR: 5.62; 95%CI 2.27-13.92) were associated with hypertriglyceridemia in children. Children of parents with dyslipidemia had a higher prevalence of elevated low-density lipoproteins (LDL-c) (OR: 1.52; 95%CI 1.18-1.97). An investigation of the family history of dyslipidemia should be made as part of the protocol to verify the presence of hypertriglyceridemia and dyslipidemia in children.
