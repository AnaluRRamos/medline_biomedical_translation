Analysis of population growth trends and aging-which is associated with occurrence of chronic diseases, in addition to (work-related or not) diseases and accidents in general-points to an increasing need to implement rehabilitation services worldwide. Rehabilitation comprises three aspects: medical, vocational and social. The aim of the present study was to describe the state of the art in vocational rehabilitation approaches in several countries, as well as vocational rehabilitation-based return-to-work strategies for individuals with restrictions due to diseases and accidents in general developed in the past 30 years. We performed an integrative review of studies located in databases Virtual Health Library-Regional Library of Medicine (VHL-BIREME), PubMed, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PsycINFO, Web of Science, Sociological Abstracts, Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) and SCOPUS. A total of 1,109 studies were initially retrieved, of which 12 were considered eligible on methodological assessment and included for review. The selected studies analyzed new approaches and the implementation of existing programs, new programs/projects, and educational measures for workers on sick leave. Most programs had multidisciplinary nature and included complementary educational approaches, early intervention, and possibility of workplace adjustments. The studies on new projects consisted in job retention and return-to-work programs for unemployed or temporary workers. The number of studies which describe occupational rehabilitation programs is small and evaluating their efficacy is difficult. Scientific research on this subject is still scarce vis-Ã -vis the current demands.
