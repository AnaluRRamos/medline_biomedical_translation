Although the Brazilian List of Avoidable Causes of Deaths (LBE in Portuguese), in its version for children under 5 years of age (LBE < 5), does not include stillbirths, some studies have used the list with or without adaptations. We present a proposal for adaptation of the LBE for stillbirths (LBE-OF in Portuguese) and the results of its application to stillbirths in the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 2018, compared to the results with LBE < 5. We reviewed the categories from the 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) in the LBE < 5 and reassigned them in the avoidability groups, according to time of death in relation to delivery and the causes consistent with stillbirths. Conditions that did not elucidate the determinants of death were allocated as ill-defined causes. Stillbirths in the State of Rio de Janeiro, selected from the databases of the Mortality Information System (SIM in Portuguese), were classified according to LBE-OF and LBE < 5. When classifying the 2,585 stillbirths that occurred in the State of Rio de Janeiro in 2018, we found that according to LBE < 5, there were predominantly causes 'reducible by adequate care in labor and delivery' (42.9%), while according to LBE-OF, the most frequent causes were 'reducible by adequate care for during pregnancy' (43.6%). Ill-defined causes ranked second according to the LBE-OF (35.4%) and third according to LBE < 5. Some 30% of stillbirths changed groups and subgroups of avoidability, showing greater consistency with the profile of obstetric care. Although identifying a higher percentage of ill-defined causes, the LBE-OF is more consistent with the pathophysiology of fetal deaths. The inclusion of stillbirths in the SIM would be a positive step in monitoring and upgrading the investigation of causes of fetal death.
