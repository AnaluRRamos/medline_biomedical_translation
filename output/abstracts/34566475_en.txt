To compare the use of intravenous and topical tranexamic acid (TXA) in unilateral primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in relation to blood loss and complications inherent to the medication. Three groups with 14 patients each were constituted, and all of them were operated using the same surgical technique. In Group 1, usual measures for bleeding control were performed. Group 2 patients received TXA topically on the joint surface. In Group 3, intravenous TXA was used. Hemoglobin (HB), hematocrit (HTC), platelets (PLAT), prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time and volume of blood drained observed 24 hours after arthroplasty were compared to the values of tests found before surgery. There was a decrease in the concentration of HB, HTC and PLAT in all groups in relation to the preoperative, however without significant difference. Group 3 had a lower mean volume of drained blood than the other groups, with statistical significance. No adverse effects or thromboembolic events were observed in the groups that received TXA. This study showed superiority in the use of intravenous TXA in decreasing the volume of bleeding, without increasing the risk of thromboembolic events. <b><i>Level of Evidence I, High quality randomized trial with statistically significant difference or no statistically significant difference but narrow confidence intervals.</i></b>
