This exploratory qualitative study aimed to identify sociocultural and intergenerational aspects of perception and practices in child feeding among quilombola women, members of maroon communities in Brazil. A focus group with 12 mothers and another group with four grandmothers of children under five years of age were conducted in a rural quilombola community in the State of Goi√°s, Brazil. The data were analyzed with thematic content analysis, yielding four central themes and respective subthemes, which were then represented in a socioecological conceptual model with four levels of influence on child feeding as the outcome. Theme 1 dealt with the reasons for breastfeeding which included the child's health, financial issues, and positive maternal attitude toward breastfeeding. Theme 2 encompassed factors that negatively influence breastfeeding, such as the perception of 'too little milk', use of teas, sequential pregnancy, and the child's characteristics. Theme 3 dealt with complementary feeding, generally introduced too early, including foods consumed by the family and ultra-processed foods. Theme 4 addressed the support network, consisting of the family and community dimension, featuring the grandmothers' role, acting in the intergenerational transmission of traditional knowledge and support for mothers, while health services, with educational activities related to breastfeeding, played a lesser role in quilombola women's decisions and practices. The promotion of adequate and healthy child feeding practices should address aspects of the quilombola women's sociocultural context and adopt emancipatory approaches, guaranteeing quality care for this population.
