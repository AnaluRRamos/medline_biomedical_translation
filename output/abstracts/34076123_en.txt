The objective was to ve rify the association between sexual maturation and physical activity during adolescence. A systematic review of articles published between 2008 and 2018 was conducted using the following databases: PubMed/Medline, SciELO, Web of Science, Scopus, Lilacs, and BVS Adolec Brasil. The following descriptors and keywords were used in English and Portuguese: adolescent, sexual maturation, survey, questionnaire, and physical activity. The literature search retrieved 806 articles. Twelve articles were included after applying the selection criteria. Level of physical activity was highest in the initial stage of sexual maturation. Levels of physical activity appear to decrease with advancing sexual maturation status. There is no consensus about the association between sexual maturation and physical activity levels among adolescents within the literature reviewed by this study. Further research is needed to investigate whether this relationship exists and professionals involved in healthcare for adolescents should take effective steps to combat physical inactivity.
