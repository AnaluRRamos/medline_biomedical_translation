This article deals with a public policy in education, Post Graduation in Collective Health, to identify forms of dialogue of this policy, with the public health policy, the SUS, starting in 1990. The main product of PGSC policy is the training of masters and doctors, essential for teaching and research in the field. Bibliographic review and analysis of CAPES documents and databases based the analysis. Education policy was consistent over time and core to social development, alongside health policy, without presenting formal points of intercession, and its impacts occur mainly through the formation of good and committed professionals, teachers and researchers. In PGSC, professional masters programs are more relevant, for a more direct link of postgraduate programs with the SUS, and the initiatives of the Ministry of Health to finance priorities in research for the Health System. Even ininitiatives that explicitly seek to approximate the knowledge produced by PG with praxis in the SUS, the mechanisms involved in translating or impacting scientific knowledge into concrete practice are complex and must be context specific andthematic.
