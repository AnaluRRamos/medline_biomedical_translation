Infestation of Lynxacarus radovskyi (Lynxacarosis) on cats is usually asymptomatic - most cats are presented with a dull, dry, dishevelled coat, with easily epilated hairs. The physical presence of the mite gives the coat a 'peppered' appearance, and previous reports have described some cats developing pruritus and alopecia. To describe the clinical signs of Lynxacarus radovskyi associated self-induced alopecia. Eleven client-owned, indoor and naturally infested cats. Cats with the primary complaint of pruritus and alopecia with sole infestation of Lynxacarus radovskyi, were included in this case series. Their age, sex, breed and clinical presentation were recorded. Cats were treated with selamectin twice, with a 14Â day interval, followed by monthly maintenance therapy. Self-induced alopecia was found on the perianal (10 of 11), caudal-lateral thighs (eight of 11), sacral-tail base region, abdomen (each seven of 11), on the flanks (five of 11) and dorsal-lumbar (four of 11) areas. There were no eosinophilic dermatitis lesions nor head and neck pruritus in any cat. Lynxacarus radovskyi infested cats can have lesions which are strikingly similar to flea allergic dermatitis with lesions most commonly found on the perianal area.
