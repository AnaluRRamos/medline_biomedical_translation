This article sets out to identify the socio-demographic and nutritional factors associated with the nutritional status of iodine in the maternal-infant group. The review was based on the Prisma method and the Medline (PubMed), Scopus and Lilacs databases were consulted. The search was conducted in December 2018, using the key words nutritional status, iodine, infant, pregnant and lactating. The selection followed the stages of excluding duplicated articles, reading the titles, abstracts and texts in full. A total of 1,500 studies were identified and 26 met the inclusion criteria. The methodological quality of the studies was evaluated using the questionnaire proposed by Downs and Black. There was an association between the sociodemographic factors of income, education, maternal and gestational age, uniformity and place of residence in rural or urban areas with the nutritional state of iodine. In relation to dietary factors, the consumption of supplements, iodized salt and dietary sources of iodine, especially dairy products, play a protective role to avoid the deficiency. It is necessary to create more specific and effective strategies that address all the factors that affect the nutritional state of iodine to avoid the disorders resulting from the deficiency.
