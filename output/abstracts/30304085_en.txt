To analyze the characteristics and outcomes of children hospitalized for burns in a pediatric trauma intensive care unit for burn patients. An observational study was conducted through the retrospective analysis of children (< 16 years) admitted to the pediatric trauma intensive care unit for burn victims between January 2013 and December 2015. Sociodemographic and clinical variables were analyzed including the causal agent, burned body surface, presence of inhalation injury, length of hospital stay and mortality. The study analyzed a sum of 140 patients; 61.8% were male, with a median age of 24 months and an overall mortality of 5%. The main cause of burns was scalding (51.4%), followed by accidents involving fire (38.6%) and electric shock (6.4%). Mechanical ventilation was used in 20.7% of the cases. Associated inhalation injury presented a relative risk of 6.1 (3.5 - 10.7) of needing ventilatory support and a relative risk of mortality of 14.1 (2.9 - 68.3) compared to patients without this associated injury. A significant connection was found between burned body surface and mortality (p < 0.002), reaching 80% in patients with a burned area greater than 50%. Patients who died had a significantly higher Tobiasen Abbreviated Burn Severity Index than survivors (9.6 ± 2.2 versus 4.4 ± 1.1; p < 0.001). A Tobiasen Abbreviated Burn Severity Index ≥ 7 represented a relative risk of death of 68.4 (95%CI 9.1 - 513.5). Scalding burns are quite frequent and are associated with high morbidity. Mortality is associated with the amount of burned body surface and the presence of inhalation injury. Special emphasis should be given to accidents involving fire, reinforcing proper diagnosis and treatment of inhalation injury.
