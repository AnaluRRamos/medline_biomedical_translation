The authors report the case of a 41-year-old woman with a colonic perforation due to a ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) catheter. Left-sided colonic perforation was diagnosed by abdominal computed tomography 28 years after shunt placement, following acute meningitis caused by <i>Escherichia coli</i>. The proximal end of the VPS was exteriorized and it was decided to remove the distal end by colonoscopy. After pulling out the catheter with a polypectomy snare, it broke at the site where it was entering the colon, leaving a small perforation in the colonic wall which was closed with 2 endoclips. The endoluminal fragment of the catheter, being 20 cm in length, was removed through the rectum. The patient is asymptomatic at the 12-month follow-up. A review of the literature regarding 9 endoscopically managed cases of digestive tract perforation caused by VPS is presented.
