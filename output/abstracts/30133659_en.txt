The objective was to analyze the impact of the Brazilian Traffic Code and the Law Against Drinking and Driving on mortality from traffic accidents in the State of Paran√°, Brazil, from 1980 to 2014. This was an ecological time series study on mortality from traffic accidents in residents 15 to 49 years of age, stratified by the sex, age, and categories of victims, with data from the Mortality Information System. The time trend study used a segmented linear regression model and the Cochrane-Orcutt iterative procedure. The assumption of independence of residuals was verified by correlograms and the Box-Pierce test. The highest mortality rates during the period were in males 20 to 29 years of age. After enactment of the Brazilian Traffic Code, there was a decrease of 9.69 deaths/100,000 inhabitants per year for all categories of traffic accidents (p < 0.001), 6.90 for pedestrians (p = 0.001), and 1.96 for vehicle occupants (p < 0.001). As for age bracket, the greatest impact on mortality was in pedestrians 15 to 19 years of age (p < 0.001) and all victims 20 to 29 years of age (p < 0.001). Following enactment of the Drinking and Driving Law, the data displayed variability and the trends were not significant. However, there was a decrease in overall and pedestrian mortality. The rates for motorcyclists and vehicle occupants stabilized. The results showed an impact on traffic accident mortality after enactment of the new Brazilian Traffic Code and Drinking and Driving Law, followed by an increase in the rates. The study evidenced the need for more effective enforcement and progress with public policies in order to avoid a reversal of the gains achieved.
