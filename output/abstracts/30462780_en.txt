To analyze the communication of a child's death and the grief support provided to the women during puerperium. This is a qualitative study performed at a capital of the Northeast region of Brazil. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 15 women, whose children died from July 2012 to July 2014. The interviews contained questions about the child's death and the grieving process. The content analysis was performed with a thematic approach. The women expressed the suffering and the anguish of the loss of a child, sometimes aggravated by the way in which the news of death was delivered, and by the lack of support offered in the coping process. Two empirical categories were found: receiving the news of death and going back home empty-handed. The health care teams are not prepared to deliver bad news, nor to give support to women who lose a newborn child. According to the women, the support received from the family and religion helped them in the grieving process. The results indicate the need for professional qualification for the delivery of bad news and for grief support. They also showed the need for institutional policies that offer support to the professionals. Besides, the articulation with the primary health care team is imperative for the continuity of care.
