This study evaluated whether the use of dental services of the Unified Health System (SUS) by elderly Brazilians is equitable. Individual data collected by qualified professionals during the national oral health survey (2010) and contextual data from DATASUS and IBGE were used. The dependent variable was the type of service used: SUS and others. Multilevel analyses were conducted using logistic regression (Î±=5%) (OR/CI 95%) using SPSS 24.0. A total of 6,303 elderly people were included and the prevalence of dental service use in SUS was 30%. Associated contextual factors were: access to bathroom and running water (1.54/1.19-2.00) and the dental care index (1.41/1.10-1.81); the individual factors were: age (0.77/0.66-0.90), years of schooling (1.83/1.53-2.20), family income (2.57/2.20-3.01), reason for last dental visit (0.75/0.60-0.93), decayed teeth total (1.26/1.08-1.48), plugged teeth total (0.63/0.54-0.74), dental prosthesis use (2.23/1.91-2.59), dental pain (1.36/1.11-1.67), self-perception of the need for dental treatment (1.20/1.12-1.51) and need for dental prosthesis (1.38/1.20-1.59). Dental service from SUS has been equitable, however it is necessary to organize the working process, enabling its use in a regular and preventive manner, thereby seeking universality and comprehensiveness.
