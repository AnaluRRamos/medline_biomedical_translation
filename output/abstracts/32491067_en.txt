In spite of proven effectiveness of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), shock therapy delivered by the device may result in increased levels of anxiety and depression, leading to deleterious effects on quality of life. To carry out the translation, cross-cultural adaptation and validation of the <i>Florida Shock Anxiety Scale</i> (FSAS) scale into Brazilian Portuguese. In this psychometric study, construct validity was performed by exploratory (EFA) and confirmatory (CFA) factor analyses, and by item response theory (IRT). The adjustment indexes of the CFA were: Robust Mean-Scaled Chi Square/df NNFI, CFI (Comparative Fit Index), GFI (Goodness Fit Index), AGFI (Adjusted Goodness Fit Index), RMSEA (Root Mean Square Error of Approximation) and RMSR (Root Mean Square of Residuals). Reliability was evaluated through Cronbach’s Alpha, McDonald’s Omega and Greatest Lower Bound (GLB). The analyses were carried out with the programs SPSS 23 and Factor 10.8.01. A 5 percent significance level was used. The final Portuguese version of the FSAS was administered to 151 ICD patients, with a mean age of 55.7 ± 14.1 years, and predominantly male. The parallel analysis indicated that the FSAS is unidimensional, with an explained variance of 64.4%. The correlations ranged from 0.31 to 0.77, factor loadings from 0.67 to 0.86, and communalities from 0.46 to 0.74. The adjustment indexes of the CFA were above the quality threshold. Satisfactory reliability evidence was provided by the FSAS. The FSAS-Br showed consistent validity and reliability evidence. Therefore, it can be used in ICD patients in Brazil.
