Topical treatments can be beneficial for managing canine superficial pyoderma. A novel antiseptic agent, olanexidine gluconate, has become available recently for use in humans, and its efficacy for canine pyoderma as topical therapy is unknown. The antimicrobial effect of olanexidine was evaluated using minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) towards Staphylococcus pseudintermedius. Furthermore, its clinical efficacy in canine superficial pyoderma was assessed in a randomized, single-blinded study. Twenty-eight client-owned dogs with atopic dermatitis and superficial pyoderma. The MIC of olanexidine was determined for S. pseudintermedius isolates (n=73) by serial dilution of 96-well broth microdilution method. Regarding the clinical trial, all recruited dogs were randomized into two groups; one treated with 1.5% olanexidine spray once daily and the other with a 3% chlorhexidine shampoo once a week for 2 times, respectively. Clinical assessment was performed at days 0 and 14 according to the guidelines of the Japanese Society of Antimicrobials for Animals. The MIC values for methicillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius (MRSP) and methicillin-sensitive S. pseudintermedius (MSSP) were 0.23 μg/ml and 0.24 μg/ml (P =0.9), respectively. In clinical trial, olanexidine and chlorhexidine showed substantial improvement in clinical presentation compared to the baseline. Olanexidine showed comparable efficacy to chlorhexidine (P=0.73). Moreover, the MIC against S. pseudintermedius indicated high bactericidal activity, which was supported by the topical effectiveness of olanexidine.
