Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological disorder characterized by motor disturbances, neuropsychological symptoms and cognitive changes, including cases of dementia. The most frequently described cognitive changes in these patients involve executive and visuospatial functions, which are very important for the execution of daily life activities. To compare different tests used to examine visuospatial functions in patients with PD. Thirty-five patients (21 women) with PD symptoms (medicated and 'on') and mean schooling of 5.5±4.2 years were examined using the following tests: <i>Mini-Mental State Examination</i> (MMSE), <i>Dementia Rating Scale</i> (DRS), <i>Scales of Outcomes of Parkinson's Disease</i> (SCOPA-COG), <i>Hooper Visual Organization Test</i> (HVOT), <i>Judgment of Line Orientation, Form V</i> (JLO), and <i>Clock drawing task - CLOX</i> (1 and 2). The mean MMSE score was 24.8±3.03and 54.8% of the patients performed correctly in the copy of a pentagon drawing, with a medium-level performance in most tests. Good correlations were detected between JLO versus SCOPA <i>Assembling patterns</i> (0.67), JLO versus HVOT (0.56), JLO versus CLOX2 (0.64), SCOPA <i>Figure Composition</i> versus HVOT (0.54), CLOX1 versus CLOX2 (0.43), and DRS <i>Construction</i> versus CLOX2 (0.42). Although correlations were detected, not all were strong, probably because the tests employed do not measure solely visuospatial functions, but also other skills such as attention, motor ability and executive functions. A limitation of the present study was the lack of a control group for the establishment of adequate standards for this population.
