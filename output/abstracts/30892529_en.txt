This paper aims to describe the dream content of crack cocaine users as per their view and analyze its interference in the drug withdrawal process. This is a qualitative research with 21 crack cocaine users. Consuming crack cocaine during the dream meant a proof of failure or compensatory pleasure or warning of potential relapse; not consuming the crack cocaine meant the emergence of withdrawal symptoms or the success at overcoming drug dependence. Dream interpretation may lead users to craving and relapse. The outcomes may contribute to effective therapeutic interventions.
