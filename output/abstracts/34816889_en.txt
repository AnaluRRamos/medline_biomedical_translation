To describe the completeness and characteristics of reported gestational syphilis and congenital syphilis cases in the state of Bahia, Brazil, between 2007 and 2017. This was an ecological study using data retrieved from the Notifiable Health Conditions Information System (SINAN). Incidence rates at the macro-regional and state levels and percentage completeness were calculated. 15,050 gestational syphilis cases and 7,812 congenital syphilis cases were identified. The incidence rate varied from 1.3 to 15.1 cases in pregnant women/1,000 live births and from 0.5 to 6.7 cases in infants under 1 year old/1,000 live births. Completeness of 'clinical classification' of gestational syphilis varied from 58.2% to 67.2% in the periods studied. The study showed an increase in incidence rates, flaws in report form completion and the need to implement routine information quality evaluation.
