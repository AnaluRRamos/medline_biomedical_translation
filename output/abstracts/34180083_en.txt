Caparinia tripilis is a common ectoparasitic mite affecting African pygmy hedgehogs, and is associated with pruritus and self-trauma. There have been no published surveys on the prevalence of such mites in pet African pygmy hedgehogs in Italy. To evaluate the prevalence and clinical signs of C. tripilis infestation in African pygmy hedgehogs. Clinical records of hedgehogs examined between December 2017 and December 2020 were searched retrospectively. The prevalence of C. tripilis infestation was evaluated and exposure variables were assessed using stepwise conditional logistic regression and odds ratios (OR) were calculated. The overall prevalence of C. tripilis was 39.5% (81 of 205) in client-owned and 81.5% (66 of 81) in pet shop-housed affected hedgehogs. Fifty-two hedgehogs (64.2%) showed clinical signs of pruritus, scales, erythema, spine loss, crusting, alopecia and lichenification, while 29 infested hedgehogs (35.8%) were asymptomatic. The head was the most frequently affected area in 30 of 81 (37%) animals. In a multivariable analysis, affected hedgehogs were significantly younger [OR 0.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.1-0.73; P = 0.0097] and more likely to be from a pet shop (OR 2.1, 95%CI 1-4.4; P = 0.04) than unaffected hedgehogs. The results of this study indicate a prevalence rate of C. tripilis infestation that is consistent with trends observed in other studies. African pygmy hedgehogs, especially younger animals and those originating from a pet shop, should always be evaluated for C. tripilis.
