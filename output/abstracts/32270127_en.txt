Gas station attendants are at high risk of poisoning due to continuous exposure to fuel fumes. Benzene, present in gasoline, is considered a carcinogen and harmful to the health of gas station attendants. To investigate genotoxic effects on exfoliated oral mucosa cells in association with occupational exposure among gas station attendants in Santarem, Para, Brazil, and to establish the rate of adherence to personal protective equipment (PPE). The results of the micronucleus test performed with oral mucosa cells stained by means of the Feulgen and Fast Green methods were compared between 126 exposed gas station attendants distributed across six groups and controls. The frequency of micronuclei was higher among gas station attendants compared to the group not exposed to benzene (p<0.01). The frequency of micronuclei was significantly higher (p<0.01) among the gas station attendants who reported to drink alcohol compared to non-drinkers. None of the participants (0%) used PPE. The frequency of micronuclei in exfoliated oral mucosa cells was higher among gas station attendants compared to controls; frequency was even higher for the gas station attendants who reported to consume alcohol often.
