To characterize growth trajectories of children who develop multiple sclerosis compared to typically developing, regional peers and Centers for Disease Control (CDC) normative values. This case-control study collected weight, height, and body mass index (BMI) in 40 consecutive pediatric patients with multiple sclerosis (28 females, 12 males), in addition to 120 typically developing peers (84 females, 36 males), identified and matched for year of birth, sex, ethnicity, and socio-economic status. BMI values were converted to z-scores based on CDC reference values and were compared with respect to age between our two cohorts and by years relative to multiple sclerosis onset for cases. Median age for the clinical onset of multiple sclerosis was 15 years. BMI z-scores are significantly higher for patients with multiple sclerosis compared to typically developing, demographically-matched peers and CDC standards. These significant differences in BMI are noted from 4 years of age and onward. Height trajectories were similar among case and control individuals and CDC normative values. BMI in pediatric multiple sclerosis is markedly higher, beginning in early childhood, years before the clinical-onset of the disease. Children with multiple sclerosis are significantly more overweight than typically developing peers at the time of diagnosis. Body mass index trajectories are significantly higher years before the clinical manifestation(s) of multiple sclerosis.
