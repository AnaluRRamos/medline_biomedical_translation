Respiratory problems have a significant impact on morbidity and mortality in patients with cerebral palsy (CP). In particular, recurrent aspiration, impaired airway clearance, spinal and thoracic deformity, impaired lung function, poor nutritional status, and recurrent respiratory infections negatively affect respiratory status. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia may contribute to pulmonary problems, but asthma is not more common in CP than in the general population. We discuss treatment options for each of these factors. Multiple coexisting and interacting factors that influence the respiratory status of patients with CP should be recognized and effectively addressed to reduce respiratory morbidity and mortality. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Respiratory problems are a significant cause of morbidity in patients with cerebral palsy (CP). Respiratory status in patients with CP is influenced by recurrent aspiration and impaired airway clearance. Spinal and thoracic deformity, impaired lung function, poor nutrition, and respiratory infections also negatively affect respiratory status. These factors should all be addressed to reduce respiratory problems in patients with CP.
