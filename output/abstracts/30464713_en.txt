Myxofibrosarcoma (MFS) is a common soft tissue sarcoma (STS) that affects the extremities in elderly patients. The objective was to analyze the prognostic factors and outcomes of patients with MFS treated at a single institution. We retrospectively reviewed the records of 75 patients with MFS. We compared age, sex, tumor size and location, grade and stage of the disease. Median age was 49.7 years (range, 1 to 88 y). upper extremity (25.4%), lower extremity (66.6%) and pelvis (8%). Patients had high-grade tumors in 46.7% of the reports. Margins were negative in 76% of the cases. Bivariate Cox regression analysis was used to determine associations between clinical and treatment factors with local recurrence (LR). Median follow-up time was 30.7 months (range, 1.8 to 383.8 m). We found 26.7% of LR. Distant metastasis (DM) was reported in 27 (36%) patients. Lung was the most common site of DM, reported in 92.6% of patients. Overall survival (OS) with metastasis was 21.2 months (range, 4.8 to 114.8 m). Predictors of OS were grade, LR (hazard ratio [HR] 5.13, 95% confidence interval, 2.15-12.24, <i>P</i> <0.001), and DM (HR 540.97, 95% confidence interval, 5.04-58112.03, <i>P<</i> 0.001). Tumor grade, LR, positive margins and DM were significant predictors of poor OS prognosis. <b>Level of Evidence IV, Case Series.</b>
