To estimate magnitude and determinants of neonatal and postneonatal mortality rates in Goi√¢nia, Brazil, 2012. This was a retrospective cohort study based on data linkage of the Live Birth Information System and the Mortality Information System. Logistic regression was used to evaluate factors associated with neonatal and postneonatal death. Neonatal mortality (0-27 days of life) was 9.4 deaths per 1,000 live births; while postneonatal mortality (28-364 days of life) was 3.0 deaths per 1,000 live births. Neonatal mortality associated factors were: 0-3 prenatal care visits (OR=13.10 - 95%CI 7.48;22.96), 19-34-week pregnancy (OR=6.25 - 95%CI 2.26;17.29), birth weight <1,500g (OR=62.42 - 95%CI 22.72;171.48) and cesarean delivery (OR=0.54 - 95%CI 0.37;0.79). Postneonatal mortality associated factors were: 0-3 prenatal care visits (OR=4.16 - 95%CI 1.51;11.43) and birth weight <1.500g (OR=18.74 - 95%CI 4.04;87.00). A low number of prenatal care visits, premature childbirth and low birth weight were the main risk factors for neonatal and postneonatal mortality.
