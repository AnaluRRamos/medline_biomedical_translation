To revise HIV-1 vertical transmission (VT) rates in the metropolitan area of Belo Horizonte, Brazil, from January of 2006 to December of 2014.  Descriptive study of a prospective cohort of HIV-1-infected pregnant women and their children, monitored by the Maternal and Child HIV/Aids Research Group of Research Group at Faculty of Medicine of Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Brazil.  The VT general rate was 1.9% (13/673; confidence interval [CI] 95%: 1.0-3.3). The extensive use of combined highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) (89.7%; 583/650) strongly impacted the reduction of VT during this period. Maternal viral load (VL) higher than 1,000 copies/mL showed significant association with VT (OR:6.6; CI 95%:1.3-33.3). Maternal breastfeeding was described in 10 cases in this cohort (1.5%; CI 95%: 0.7-2.7), but it was not associated with VT.  The present cohort data were coherent with the low VT rate described in other global populations, and it was considerably lower in comparison to the results of the same cohort during the period of 1998-2005, when the VT rate was 6.2%. These data confirm the efficiency of the National Guidelines, and emphasize the importance of adopting the international recommended procedures for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV.
