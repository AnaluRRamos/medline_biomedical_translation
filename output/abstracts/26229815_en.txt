to compare the SALSA and risk awareness scales with the DASH scale in assessments on leprosy surgery. before the operation and 90 days afterwards, we applied the tests to 14 patients (11 females and three males) of ages from 28 to 67 years, who were operated between November 2011 and May 2012. the patients were evaluated after the operation using the SALSA and DASH scales, to measure their relationships and results. despite the small sample, this study showed that there were similar relationships of results between the SALSA/risk awareness and DASH scales.
