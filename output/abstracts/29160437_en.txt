To describe people with diabetes in Brazil and to compare their sociodemographic characteristics, access and self-reported adherence to diabetes prescribed drugs. Data analysis from the National Survey on Access, Use and Promotion of the Rational Use of Medicines, a household survey, with sampling by clusters, according to sex and age domains and national and macro-regional representativeness. Adults (≥ 20 years old) who reported having diabetes constituted the sample. The weighted frequencies of the variables in the sample were analyzed and the Pearson χ2 test was applied to evaluate the statistical significance of the differences between the strata for the data of access, form of financing and adherence to the drugs, considering the level of significance of 5%. We found a higher proportion of women, people over 60 years and economy class C. Most participants reported having two or more comorbidities, in addition to diabetes, and taking five or more drugs. Regarding access, 97.8% say they have access to prescription drugs for diabetes and 70.7% say they get them totally free of charge. There was low adherence to anti-diabetic treatment, with significant macro-regional differences (p = 0,001), and greater vulnerability in the South and Northeast regions. Better access to diabetes medicines in the country has been demonstrated. However, to improve the efficiency of health public spending, it is necessary to achieve higher rates of adherence to treatment.
