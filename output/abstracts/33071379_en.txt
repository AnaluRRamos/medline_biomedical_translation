Urothelial carcinoma is a rare malignant neoplasm, accounting for only 5% to 7% of kidney tumors and 5% of urothelial tumors. During the management of urothelial carcinoma, anatomopathological evaluation is used for stratifying the tumors into different prognostic groups to aid in the evaluation of treatment results and to optimize the management of patients. Percutaneous image-guided biopsy is a safe and feasible procedure, with high sensitivity and accuracy rates. Although image-guided percutaneous biopsy of the urinary tract is a relatively uncommon procedure, it can be considered an option in selected cases or when traditional methods, such as the ureteroscopic technique, are not possible.
