The scope of the study was to assess food consumption according to the level of processing and the ingestion of nutrients among adolescents in the rural areas of Pelotas-RS. It involved a cross-sectional census-type study with 462 students in grades 6 through 9 of elementary school from 21 municipal schools in the rural area. Food consumption was evaluated by 24-hour dietary recall (24HR), with food products being classified into four groups according to the level of processing in line with the NOVA classification. The average daily energy intake was 1,921 calories, namely 48.2% from in natura or minimally processed food and 31.9% from ultra-processed food. The products that contributed most to the total daily calory intake were rice, meat, legumes, sugar, homemade bread, cookies, candies, soda, and artificial juices. A higher proportion of macro and micronutrients was observed from ingestion of in natura or minimally processed food, although carbohydrates, fat and iron contents derived from ultra-processed food was also high. The results of the study indicate that adolescents in rural areas have a higher energy intake from fresh or minimally processed food, however, it is observed that ultra-processed food is also part of their diet, thereby revealing the nutritional transition.
