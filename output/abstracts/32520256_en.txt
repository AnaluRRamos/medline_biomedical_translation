The aim of this study is to estimate the prevalence of depression and its associated factors in elderly residents of the rural area of Rio Grande/RS. In this cross-sectional population-based study performed with 994 elderly (â‰¥ 60 years), whose sampling was based on the 2010 Demographic Census, the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) was used for Major Depressive Episode (EDM) screening. Descriptive, bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed using logistic regression. The overall prevalence for Major Depressive Episode screening was 8.1%. The variables independently associated with depression were: female gender, continuous use of medications, chronic diseases, body mass index and worse health perception. The creation of programs target at the elderly in the rural area, aimed at screening, early diagnosis of depression and maintenance of treatment, encompassing several factors related to health, are important actions that must be fostered by the health system.
