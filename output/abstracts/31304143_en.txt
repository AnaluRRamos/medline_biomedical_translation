Identify the etiology and incidence, as well to assess functional outcomes of patients, undergoing lower limb amputation after failure or complication of total knee arthroplasty. These patients were treated at the Center for Knee Surgery at the National Institute of Traumatology and Orthopedics (INTO), during the period of January 2001 to December 2010. The patients were interviewed and their charts were retrospectively analyzed to evaluate their functional outcome. The incidence of amputation due to failure or complication of total knee arthroplasty was 0.41% in 2409 cases. Recurrent deep infection was the cause of amputation in 81% of cases, being <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> the most frequent germs. Vascular complications and periprosthetic fracture associated to metaphyseal bone loss were also causes of amputation. In our study, 44% of amputees patients were using orthesis and 62.5% have had the ability to walk. Incidence of 0.41%, being the main cause recurrent infection. The functional outcome is limited, and the fitting achieved in 44% of patients and only 62.5% are ambulatory.
