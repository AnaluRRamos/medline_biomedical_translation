Femoral hernias comprise a small proportion of all groin hernias. They are more common in women and have a high rate of incarceration and strangulation, leading to emergency repair. A 61-year-old female patient was admitted to the emergency department complaining of a 2-day painful lump in the right groin, that had become more intense in the last 24 hours. Physical examination suggested the presence of a strangulated femoral hernia, and the patient underwent emergency surgical repair. Intraoperatively, the right fallopian tube was observed in the hernia sac. Since there were no signs of ischemia, the tube was reduced back into the pelvic cavity and the hernia was repaired. The postoperative period was uneventful, and the patient was discharged without complications, 3 days after surgery.
