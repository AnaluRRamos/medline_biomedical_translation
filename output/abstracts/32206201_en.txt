There are few studies on the religiosity of people with Alzheimer's disease (PwAD) and caregivers, relation with quality of life (QoL) and clinical aspects. To assess the religiosity and QoL of 39 PwAD and their caregivers; to compare perceived QoL and religiosity of the PwAD with those of their caregivers; to associate QoL and religiosity with the presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms, and depression with cognitive performance of PwAD. Organizational religiosity was greater in caregivers. The AD patients had poorer perceived QoL than their caregivers. Caregiver religiosity correlated with that of the AD patients. Higher intrinsic religiosity was associated with lower occurrence of neuropsychiatric symptoms. Better caregiver QoL correlated with cognitive performance. Lower occurrence of depression correlated with better QoL of the caregivers and AD patients. The religiosity of caregivers was correlated with that of the AD patients. Better QoL and lower religiosity were observed in caregivers when compared with the AD patients. Caregiver religiosity and QoL were associated with neuropsychiatric and cognitive aspects and depression.
