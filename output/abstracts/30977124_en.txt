The nurturing care framework (NCF) for early childhood development (ECD) launched at the 2018 World Health Assembly opens a range of opportunities and challenges for child neurodisability professionals. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities frame these pathways for collaboration and progress. This overview of the NCF and its contexts in inclusive ECD identifies avenues for innovation and collaboration in harmony with the field's clinical, scientific, and advocacy agendas. One avenue involves enhancing the alignment between health systems and human rights. A second avenue involves neurodisability professionals engaging with nurturing care as leaders, partners, and implementers. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Participation and leadership by neurodisability professionals can enhance quality and impact. A rights-based framework that includes young children with disabilities and their families is widely encouraged.
