Asthma affects more than 339 million people worldwide. In the Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries, in 2016, its prevalence ranged from 9.5% (Portugal) to 3.91% (Brazil). Chronic disease management programs aim to improve the health status of patients with chronic disease and reduce associated costs. The objective of this study is to identify models of asthma asthma 'management and control' that are that are implemented in the Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries (CPLP), and analyse them through the integrated disease management model. A rapid review of the PubMed indexed scientific literature and grey literature on 'management and control of asthma' in the countries of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries was carried out. Portugal, Brazil and Mozambique presented publications on 'management and control of asthma', at different stages of implementation. Clinical management and organization and service delivery are the dimensions of integrated disease management most addressed in publications. The implementation of asthma management and control programs is influenced by health systems, care delivery structures, and the surrounding political and social environment. The dimensions of funding and information systems are the most difficult to implement given the degree of economic, social and technological development of most countries under study. Only Portugal, Brazil and Mozambique adopted asthma integrated disease management as the main form of asthma management and control. The programs developed by these countries can constitute a model for asthma integrated disease management in the other countries under study.
