This paper aims to stir reflections on research with children by investigating aspects related to ethics, methods, play and contextualized activities. The possibility of recognizing adult authority as a mediator of interactive craftsmanship in the construction of the research environment also underlie the backstage and its craftsmanship. It builds on a survey of six-year-olds in schools that focused on the psychometric analysis of items in a test under construction. Returning to the memories of this environment, we discuss the importance of the leadership of children as research subjects. The foundation is anchored in the perspective of childhood sociology, discussing interactive craftsmanship. We conclude that it is possible to recognize this leadership in the engagement of negotiations with reference adults.
