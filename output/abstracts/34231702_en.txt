The aim of this study was to analyze and assess the association between functional status (FS) and muscle strength (MS) in young adults, adults and older adults in an intensive care unit (ICU). We conducted a prospective cohort study with 48 patients. FS was assessed using the Functional Status Score for the Intensive Care Unit (FSS-ICU) and MS was measured using the Medical Research Council Sum-Score (MRC-SS) and by testing handgrip strength (HS). The assessments were performed on awakening and ICU discharge. The data were analyzed using the Kruskall-Wallis, chi-squared, Wilcoxon and Spearman's correlation tests. FS and MRC-SS scores were higher on ICU discharge in all groups. Gains were lowest in the older adult group. HS was greater in both hands on ICU discharge in all groups except the adults. FSS-ICU on both awakening and ICU discharge was highest in the adults; HS-R was lowest in the older adults. There was a strong association between FS and MS in the young adults and adults. FS and MS showed progressive improvement during ICU stay. Gains in FS and MS on awakening and ICU discharge were lowest among the older adults. Important associations were found between these variables in all groups except the older adults. This can be explained by the multifactorial nature of illness and incapacity in this group.
