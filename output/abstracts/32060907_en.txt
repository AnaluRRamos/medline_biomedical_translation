To evaluate the impact of risk factors for intracranial hypertension (ICH) on cerebral cortex thickness in syndromic craniosynostosis. ICH risk factors including papilloedema, hydrocephalus, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), cerebellar tonsillar position, occipitofrontal circumference (OFC) curve deflection, age, and sex were collected from the records of patients with syndromic craniosynostosis (Apert, Crouzon, Pfeiffer, Muenke, Saethre-Chotzen syndromes) and imaging. Magnetic resonance images were analysed and exported for statistical analysis. A linear mixed model was developed to determine correlations with cerebral cortex thickness changes. In total, 171 scans from 107 patients (83 males, 88 females [including repeated scans], mean age 8y 10mo, range 1y 1mo-34y, SD 5y 9mo) were evaluated. Mean cortical thickness in this cohort was 2.78mm (SD 0.17). Previous findings of papilloedema (p=0.036) and of hydrocephalus (p=0.007) were independently associated with cortical thinning. Cortical thickness did not vary significantly by sex (p=0.534), syndrome (p=0.896), OSA (p=0.464), OFC (p=0.375), or tonsillar position (p=0.682). Detection of papilloedema or hydrocephalus in syndromic craniosynostosis is associated with significant changes in cortical thickness, supporting the need for preventative rather than reactive treatment strategies. Papilloedema is associated with thinning of the cerebral cortex in syndromic craniosynostosis, independently of hydrocephalus.
