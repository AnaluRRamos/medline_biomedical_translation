Moyamoya disease is a rare disorder that involves the cerebrovascular system. Usually, it leads to occlusion of the arteries of the cerebral system and causes cerebral circulatory complaints. A 48-year-old female patient was admitted to our clinic with intermittent claudication in both legs. Biphasic and monophasic waveform patterns were detected bilaterally in distal (trifurcation arteries) lower extremities with Doppler sonography. The patient therefore underwent systemic vascular examination. Computed tomography angiography revealed bilateral carotid occlusion at the level of supraclinoid segments, and opacifications were detected at the distal segments of the bilateral anterior cerebellar and middle cerebellar arteries. The patient was diagnosed with moyamoya disease, and anticoagulant treatment was started. In conclusion, most previous reports have presented the cerebrovascular involvement of moyamoya disease. However, this disease can involve different peripheral vascular systems and careful and systemic vascular examination is necessary for an exact diagnosis.
