To analyze trends in pesticide poisoning incidence rates in Brazilian regions, according to sex and circumstances of poisoning, between 2001 and 2014. Ecological time-series study, with data from the national Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN). The incidence rates were calculated by dividing the number of confirmed new cases of pesticide poisoning by the total resident population in the same period and location. Both Polynomial regression analysis and Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were performed. When significant differences were found, these tests were followed by the Bonferroni penalty, in order to identify the difference more precisely. In Brazil, 80,069 notified poisoning cases were recorded from 2001 to 2014. There was a steadily increasing growth of pesticide poisoning in this population, whose growth trend was 0,377 for 100,000 inhabitants per year. The highest incidence of poisoning occurred in the South and Midest Regions. Regarding sex, no significant differences were found (p < 0,347), and attempted suicide was the most significant circumstance of poisoning (p < 0,001). The incidence of pesticide poisoning in Brazil has been continuously increasing in the twenty-first century.
