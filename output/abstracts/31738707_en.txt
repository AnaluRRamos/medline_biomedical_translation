Hypertrophic and keloid scars represent hyperproliferative disorders that can have a significant impact on patients' lives. The authors present the case of a 53 years-old male with a sternal keloid after excision of a sebaceous cyst and multiple sessions of steroid infiltration, with worsening of the lesion. The patient underwent complete excision of the scar and reconstruction with an anterolateral thigh flap - ALT. The postoperative period was uneventful, with no signs of relapse. Keloid scar treatment in sternal area implies a reconstruction with no tension, in order to avoid relapse. Treatment of this type of scars is complex and a challenge to the plastic surgeon. In this case, a microvascular tissue transfer was used to reconstruct the large defect that ultimately resulted after scar excision, in a tension-free manner.
