Aneurysmal bone cysts are benign musculoskeletal tumours, which occur in young patients and, occasionally, with aggressive behaviour. Those tumours very often will need surgical treatment with curettage and bone grafting, but for aggressive lesions, inbloc resection is more advisable. Aggressive tumours use to be large and sometimes with difficult surgical approach and demanding complex surgical reconstructions. In this scenario, selective arterial embolization is a possible primary or adjuvant treatment option. This paper presents a paradigmatic case, where selective arterial embolization allowed a successful treatment of a large aneurysmal bone cyst with difficult surgical resolution.
