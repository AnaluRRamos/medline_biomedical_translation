The most widely used data for cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) referrals are from the Cooper Clinic, which uses calculated maximal oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2</sub>max) values. To develop CRF values from cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX) in a Brazilian population with high socioeconomic level and free of structural heart disease. VO<sub>2</sub>max testing results were compared with the Cooper Clinic and FRIEND Registry data. CPX data from consecutive individuals between January 1,2000, and May 31,2016 were used in this study. Inclusion criteria were: VO<sub>2</sub>max by a pre-specified definition. We built a CRF chart according to VO<sub>2</sub>max percentiles: very poor (≤20%), poor (20-40%), fair (40-60%), good (60-80%), excellent (80-90%), and superior (≥90%). Kappa correlation was used to analyze our data in comparison with that of the other two databases. Statistical tests with p<0.005 were considered significant. Final cohort included 18,186 tests: 12,552 men, 5,634 women (7–84 years). The most recurrent response was “good” (20.2%). There was a mean difference in weight, height, body mass index (BMI), and age in the CRF chart. An inverse correlation existed between VO<sub>2</sub>max and age, weight, and BMI. Using a linear regression and these variables, a predictive equation was developed for VO<sub>2</sub>max. Our findings differed from that of the other databases. We developed a classification for CRF and found higher values in all classification ranges of functional capacity in contrast to the Cooper Clinic and FRIEND Registry. Our findings offer a more accurate interpretation of ACR in this large Brazilian population sample when compared to previous standards based on the estimated VO2max.
