to identify the reasons for refusal of corneas. this was a cross-sectional, retrospective, descriptive and correlational study composed of 5,560 optical corneas. The information was taken from the notification, organ procurement and distribution centers database as well as donor records. Descriptive statistics were used for the analysis of categorical variables and specific tests with a significance level of 5% for assessing the associations between variables. This study met the ethical aspects of scientific research. 60% of the donors were male and 40% died by circulatory problems. The main reason for refusal as informed by transplant teams is the donor's age and the endothelial cell count. For each year added to the donor's age, there is a 1% decrease in the chance that this cornea will be used for transplantation, and the increase of 100 cells per mm2 increases the chances that this cornea will be used by 9%. the main cause of refusal in the acceptance of corneal tissue is related to the age and the endothelial cell count.
