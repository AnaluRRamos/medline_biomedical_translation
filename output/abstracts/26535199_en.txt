To determine the frequency and severity of injuries that affect amateur runners. This study was conducted by means of a questionnaire applied to 204 amateur runners. Individuals who were under the age of 18 years and those who were unpracticed runners were excluded. The data gathered comprised the number, type, site and degree of severity of the injuries and the individuals' age and sex. It was observed that male athletes predominated. The mean age was 32.6 ± 9.3 years with a range from 18 to 68 years, and the injuries were classified as mild, keeping the athlete away from practicing running for fewer than eight days. Sprains, blisters and abrasions were the most frequent injuries, located most often on the lower limbs and predominantly on the feet. In practicing running, sprains, blisters and abrasions occur frequently, but are mild injuries. They mostly affect the lower limbs.
