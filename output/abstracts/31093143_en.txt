Despite the United Nations Millennium Development Goals and the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, women in numerous countries still face many challenges in obtaining good-quality health care. For example, various nations in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) do not have access to complex radiology technologies. However, conventional radiography, ultrasound, mammography, and computed tomography are available and can be used to address such women's health concerns as breast and cervical cancers, postpartum bleeding, and tuberculosis. LAC countries face additional difficulties in radiology services with respect to quality human resources, quality assurance programs, standardization, and functioning of diagnostic imaging units. These deficiencies affect the quality of the services rendered. Appropriate measures must be implemented to produce quality services and quality images and to reduce adverse events. These steps will ensure better outcomes and consequently reduce mortality and morbidity.
