The environmental consequences associated with the Fundão tailings dam failure in Mariana, Minas Gerais, Brazil on 5 November 2015 are still being investigated. Bees are the main pollinators believed to be most affected by the accident because they occur throughout the area affected by the dam rupture and build their nests in the soil. In this study, we evaluated the richness of different bee species in areas affected and not affected by the accident and measured the concentration of different metals on the pollen basket, or corbicula, located on the hind legs of Apis mellifera. Diversity indices were similar and there was no statistical difference in the diversity of bees sampled when comparing the sites affected and not affected by the tailings mud, either before or after the dam rupture. It is possible that the similarity is due to nearby forests that may be serving as areas of refuge. The levels of Al, Cu, Cd, Hg, and Pb in A. mellifera suggest no change in the level of metals in pollen collected by the bees that can be attributed to the rupture of the dam.
