This article aimed to evaluate the efficacy of arthroereisis using synthetic polyethylene implants to correct excessive valgus deformity in pediatric patients with flexible valgus flatfoot. Retrospective study of 20 pediatric patients with flexible valgus flatfoot, totaling 23 feet, between five and 14 years old, operated between January 2009 and July 2016. Clinical evaluations were performed by the Valenti podoscopic classification and the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society criteria, based on radiographic images and podoscopic analysis. These patients underwent surgical treatment with the introduction of a synthetic implant in the sinus tarsi. Multiple linear regression analysis with Backward selection of variables, angles of pre and postoperative of radiographic images of the patients submitted to arthroereisis were performed. The arthroereisis with interposition of synthetic material was satisfactory, considering that 91% of the cases presented clinical and radiographic improvement, with correction of angles and improvement in deformity degrees. Two cases presented implant loosening. The variables of the Bordelon and Pitch angles significantly influenced (p < 0,05) the improvement of the correction of deformity degrees. The arthroereisis with the interposition of synthetic polyethylene material showed to be an effective technique for flexible flatfoot in symptomatic pediatric patients. <b><i>Level of Evidence II, Prognostic studies - Investigating the Effect of a Patient Characteristic on the Outcome of Disease.</i></b>
