This was a time trend study aimed at assessing inequalities in smoking and abusive alcohol consumption, considering schooling as a proxy for socioeconomic status, according to sex and region of Brazil. The study used data from the Risk and Protective Factors Surveillance System for Chronic Non-Comunicable Diseases Through Telephone Interview (Vigitel) survey collected from 2006 to 2017. The outcomes were abusive alcohol consumption and smoking. The inequalities were assessed based on schooling, with double stratification by sex and major geographic region. Weighted linear least squares regression was used to assess the trend in prevalence of outcomes and their inequalities. Prevalence of abusive alcohol consumption increased in women, from 7.8% in 2006 to 12.2% in 2017 and was consistently higher among individuals with more schooling. Prevalence of smoking decreased in both men and women and was consistently higher among those with less schooling. Inequality in alcohol consumption between schooling groups appears to have increased over time, higher in women, but inequality in smoking appears to have decreased. In some regions of Brazil, the measures of inequality suggest stability and in others an increase in inequality in alcohol consumption (Southeast, South, and Central regions in women) and a decrease in smoking (all regions except the Southeast in men; Northeast and Central in women). Despite the strides in smoking reduction, inequalities persist in schooling and are also present in alcohol consumption. The outcomes show opposite trends, so strategies should focus on each of the problems in order to reduce existing inequalities.
