There is a current concept that illiteracy and lower educational levels are risk factors for cognitive decline and dementia. Our aims were to review the association between illiteracy and dementia; and to describe some results on neuropsychological findings in illiteracy. A literature search of the PubMed database was performed. The search terms were 'dementia', 'illiteracy', 'neuropsychological evaluation', 'educational levels', and 'education'. Only papers published in Portuguese, English, and Spanish were reviewed. Illiteracy is an incontestable risk factor for dementia. It influences performance on almost cognitive tests. Many other factors could be connected to the high prevalence of dementia among illiterates: low cognitive reserve, poor control of cerebrovascular disease risk factors, difficulties in cognitive evaluation, and poor adaptation of neuropsychological tests for this specific population. Functional tests must be coupled with cognitive tests to ameliorate diagnostic accuracy.
