The study aimed to estimate the prevalence of arterial hypertension as the principal marker of chronic noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and to identify associated modifiable factors in male workers. Baseline data were used from a longitudinal study with a sample of 1,024 male workers 18 years or older in a municipality in Northeast Brazil. The marker for NCDs was arterial hypertension, defined as systolic pressure ≥ 140mmHg and/or diastolic pressure ≥ 90mmHg and/or prior diagnosis of arterial hypertension and/or use of antihypertensive medication. Poisson regression with robust variance was used, adopting hierarchical entry of variables. Population attributable fractions (PAFs) were calculated for the lifestyle variables to measure the impact of modifiable factors on workers' health. Prevalence of hypertension was 28.6% (95%CI: 25.9-31.5). Distal factors associated with hypertension were age > 40 years, black skin color, and family income ≥ 3 times the monthly minimum wage. Intermediate factors were alcohol abuse, smoking, high self-rated salt intake, and physical inactivity. Proximal factors were overweight and obesity. Calculation of PAFs showed that a reduction or elimination of unhealthy lifestyle habits and behaviors in this population group would reduce the prevalence of the target NCD, hypertension, by 56.1%. The identification of modifiable factors and the ways they can negatively impact male workers' health allows planning interventions in the workplace itself to reach the largest number of individuals, aimed at reducing the harmful effects of NCDs.
