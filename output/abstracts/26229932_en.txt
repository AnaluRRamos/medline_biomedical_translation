To evaluate the medium and long term results from total knee arthroplasty with rotating tibial weight-bearing. Between January 2000 and July 2007, 162 patients underwent total knee arthroplasty with mobile tibial weight-bearing. Among these, 96 were evaluated in a previous study with a mean follow-up of 4 years. In the present study, the same group was invited back for reassessment and the results were analyzed. Sixty-nine patients responded to this call (79 knees), and they were evaluated in accordance with the Knee Society Rating System (KSRS), after a mean follow-up of 8 years and 8 months (ranging from 5.5 and 13 years). A mean KSRS score of 74.41 points was obtained, with good or excellent results. The medium and long-term results from total knee arthroplasty with mobile tibial weight-bearing were good, and a mean score of 74.41 points in the Knee Society Clinical Rating System was attained.
