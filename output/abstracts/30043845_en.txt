The authors analyze the relations between two subareas of Collective Health - Planning and Evaluation - through a bibliometric study of articles, theses, and dissertations published from 1980 to 2016. The overall production on Evaluation exceeds that of Planning, particularly since the 2000s. The capacity to influence health sector administration appears to drive the dispute between the two subareas. Both have theoretical and methodological resources to overcome their reductions under the instrumental logic of so-called managerialism, as well as to consolidate themselves as devices for reflection and change.
