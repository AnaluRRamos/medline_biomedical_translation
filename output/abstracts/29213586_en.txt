Cerebral subcortical atrophy occurs in both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) but its significance for clinical manifestations and differential diagnosis between these common types of dementia has not been extensively investigated. To compare the severity of cerebral subcortical atrophy in FTD and AD and to analyze the correlations between cerebral subcortical atrophy and demographics and clinical characteristics. Twenty three patients with FTD and 21 with AD formed the sample, which comprised 22 men and 22 women, aged 33 to 89, with mean age (±SD) of 68.52±12.08 years, with schooling ranging from 1 to 20 years, with a mean (±SD) of 7.35±5.54 years, and disease duration with a mean (±SD) of 3.66±3.44 years. The degree of cerebral subcortical atrophy was measured indirectly with a linear measurement of subcortical atrophy, the Bifrontal Index (BFI), using magnetic resonance imaging. We evaluated cognition, activities of daily living and dementia severity with the Mini-Mental State Examination, Functional Activities Questionnaire and the Clinical Dementia Rating, respectively. There was no significant difference (p>0.05) in BFI between FTD and AD. The severity of cognitive deficits (for both FTD and AD groups) and level of daily living activities (only for AD group) were correlated with BFI. A linear measurement of cerebral subcortical atrophy did not differentiate AD from FTD in this sample. Cognitive function (in both FTD and AD groups) and capacity for independent living (only in AD group) were inversely correlated with cerebral subcortical atrophy.
