In the COVID-19 pandemic, the increase in the incidence of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and mortality from them has been recognized worldwide. In Brazil, the impact of COVID-19 on CVD must be evaluated. To assess the impact of the current pandemic on the numbers of hospital admissions (HA), in-hospital deaths (ID), and in-hospital fatality (IF) from CVD by use of national epidemiological data from the Brazilian Unified Public Health System. Time-series observational study using comparative analysis of the HA, ID, and IF due to CVD recorded from January to May 2020, having as reference the values registered in the same period from 2016 to 2019 and the values projected by linear regression methods for 2020. The statistical significance level applied was 0.05. Compared to the same period in 2019, there was a 15% decrease in the HA rate and a 9% decrease in the total ID due to CVD between March and May 2020, followed by a 9% increase in the IF rate due to CVD, especially among patients aged 20-59 years. The HA and IF rates registered in 2020 differed significantly from the projected trend for 2020 (p = 0.0005 and 0.0318, respectively). During the first months of the pandemic, there were a decline in HA and an increase in IF due to CVD in Brazil. These data might have resulted from the inadequate planning of the CVD management during the pandemic. Thus, immediate actions are required to change this scenario.
