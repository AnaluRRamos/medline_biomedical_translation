Eosinophilic dermatitis was observed in skin samples from Jersey cows, sampled in mid-October in south-west France. The inflammatory response was considered to be the result of Trombiculidae bites. Clinical signs were assumed to be due partly to self-trauma and included patchy alopecia with crusted papules; lesions were observed on the jaws, dewlap, perineum and distal limbs. Identified parasites were larvae of Leptotrombidium spp. The lesions had completely self-resolved by December.
