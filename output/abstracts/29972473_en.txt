to investigate the characteristics of health communication services taking the Municipal Health Department Councils network in Brazil as a basis. this was a quantitative study with an exploratory design conducted in 2014-2015, using non-probability sampling. Four structured questionnaires were used examining four dimensions: 1) structure of the communication advisory service work; 2) profile of the professionals working in these services; 3) the main duties of these advisory services, and 4) possible variants of municipalities not having this specialized service. 72 of the 122 participating municipalities did not have a communication advisory service and only two network members had communications directorates; work facilities were precarious, professionals had little length of communication advisory service; they did not have job stability and were not members of the health management councils. Although they provide direct advice to health secretaries, the working conditions of communication professionals compromise their planning actions.
