This study compares the availability of basic sanitation infrastructure in indigenous and nonindigenous household located in urban and rural areas using data from the 2000 and 2010 Brazilian National Censuses. The analyses were based on descriptive statistics and modelling with multiple logistic regression. While there was an increase in the availability of basic sanitation in Brazilian households over the decade, indigenous households continued to have worse conditions in 2010. Sewage was the sanitation service with the lowest coverage in both censuses, and indigenous households had a lower rate of sewage services than nonindigenous households did. Logistic regression results confirmed the findings of the descriptive analyses, attesting to the fact that sanitation conditions are worse in indigenous households. In some areas, such as the urban North and Southeast and rural areas of the Central-West region, the gap in basic sanitation infrastructure between indigenous and nonindigenous households increased from 2000 to 2010. This study not only indicates the less-adequate sanitation conditions in indigenous households in Brazil but also attests to the persistence of major inequalities associated with race or color in the country.
