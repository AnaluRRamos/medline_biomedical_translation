The access to healthcare of elderly individuals in their twilight years needing palliative care in the home serve as a wake-up call in terms of current healthcare programs and strategies. This study seeks to analyze the relevance of home visits within the scope of primary healthcare actions for the elderly from the standpoint of professionals of the Unified Health System (SUS). It is a study with a qualitative theoretical and methodological approach, involving comprehensive research together with 12 health professionals, based on the thinking of German philosopher Hans-Georg Gadamer. The data were systematized and analyzed using the Content Analysis method and interpreted by means of philosophical hermeneutics. It is perceived that home visits for the elderly are somewhat stressful, albeit effective, which generate human processes of trust and collective action for care with respect to the condition of others. The consensus of home visits embraces the dialogical reflection of the representation of human care and solidarity in the work of SUS. It is believed that this study will provide guidelines such that primary care managers may reflect on how important, necessary, and stressful the performance of home care in the Brazilian reality is in practice.
