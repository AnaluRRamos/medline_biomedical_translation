To evaluate the clinical and functional results of patients diagnosed with full-thickness chondral defects on symptomatic knees who underwent a biological repair technique using autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis. Seven patients who underwent surgical treatment due to chondral lesions in the knee by autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis were evaluated. The Lysholm, Kujala and visual analog scale of pain questionnaires were applied before and 12 months after the surgery. Nuclear magnetic resonance images were evaluated 12 months after surgery according to MOCART (magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue) cartilage repair tissue score. Of the seven patients evaluated, three presented defects classified as grade III and four as grade IV according to the International Cartilage Repair Society classification. Chondral defects were located in the medial femoral condyle (<i>n</i> = 2), patella (<i>n</i> = 2), and trochlea (<i>n</i> = 3). The mean age of the patients (six men and one woman) was 37.2 years (24-54 years). The mean chondral defect size was 2.11 cm<sup>2</sup> (1.0-4.6 cm<sup>2</sup>). After 12 months, post-operative nuclear magnetic resonance showed resurfacing of the lesion site with scar tissue less thick than normal cartilage in all patients. The mean MOCART score was 66.42 points. A significant decrease in pain and an improvement in the Lysholm and Kujala scores were observed. The use of the collagen I/III porcine membrane was favorable for the treatment of chondral and osteochondral lesions of the knee when assessing the results using the VAS, Lysholm, and Kujala scores 1 year after surgery, as well as when assessing the magnetic resonance image of the lesion 6 months after surgery.
