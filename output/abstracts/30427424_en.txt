With principles of respect to the protection and implementation of human rights, cultural, ethnic and racial diversity and also the promotion of equity, the Stork Network ensures the right to reproductive planning and continued provision of care in maternal and child health. This study sought to evaluate the Active Ombudsman Survey of the Stork Network conducted with women who had their births assisted by the Unified Health System (SUS) in 2012, in order to analyze ethnic/racial differences in prenatal and childbirth care. This descriptive study used the secondary database from the survey conducted by the SUS Ombudsman. The universe of this investigation was constituted by 253,647 women, and 50.8% self-declared themselves as brown, 35.4% white, 10.6% black 2.1% yellow, 0.6% Indians and for 0.5% race/color was not informed. Women of black/brown race appear to be worse off in socioeconomic characteristics, prenatal and childbirth care, in all variables studied, except concerning aggression and supplementary payment. Knowledge about inequalities and vulnerability of this group may serve to alert society and the government, and as a guideline for the development of policies and actions to reduce health inequalities.
