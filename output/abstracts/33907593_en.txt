In the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic, higher morbidity and mortality have been reported in older adults. This age group presents physiological changes and its own clinical conditions such as frailty, dementia, among others. To describe the characteristics of COVID-19 patients, both over and under 80 years old, by conducting a systematic review of the literature describing case reports, and to summarize and critically assess these characteristics. Systematic review. The study was registered on the Registry of Health Research Projects (PRISA) of the Peruvian National Institute of Health (code EI00000631). Five electronic databases (Scopus, PubMed, PubMed Central, LILACS, and SCIELO) were systematically searched during the period between December 31, 2019 and April 16, 2020. The search focused on case reports, case studies, and case series of older people with COVID-19 infection aged over or under 80 years. When selecting the cases, priority was given to clinical and epidemiological profile, laboratory and imaging patterns, and comprehensive geriatric evaluation. 1,149 articles were identified; after applying the filters, a total of 15 publications of case reports and complete records of 27 older adults were obtained. The most frequent age group was between 60 to 69 years old. There is little literature regarding case reports of older adults aged over 80 years. The most frequent parameters were hypertension, fever, cough, respiratory distress, ground-glass opacification in chest radiography and tomography. Furthermore, decrease in PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio and lymphocytes, and increase in C-reactive protein and Interleukin 6 were observed. This systematic review found little available information of patients under 80 years old, and far less for those over 80 years old, and an absence of comprehensive geriatric assessment.
