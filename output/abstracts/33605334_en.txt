The scope of this study was to assess the association between parental supervision and sedentary behavior and physical inactivity among Brazilian adolescents. Data of 102,072 students attending 9th grade from public and private school gathered in the 2015 Brazilian National Survey of School Health (PeNSE) were used. Adolescents were sedentary and physical inactive when they spent â‰¥3 hours/day sitting and practiced less then 60min/day of physical activity, respectively. Frequency of parental supervision (never, sometimes, always) was assessed through checking school homework, knowledge about what the adolescents do in their free time and understanding their problems. Logistic regression was applied and duly adjusted for sociodemographic variables. Among the adolescents, 56.3% were sedentary and 78.1% were inactive. Checking school homework was associated with lower odds of physical inactivity and sedentary behavior. Knowing what adolescents did in their free time and inspecting their belongings was associated with lower odds of physical inactivity. The understanding of problems by parents/guardians was associated with lower odds of sedentary behavior. The conclusion drawn is that greater parental supervision is associated with less physical inactivity and less sedentary behavior.
