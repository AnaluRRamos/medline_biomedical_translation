Recurrent urinary tract infection is frequent and it is related to morbidity, costs and growing antibiotic resistance. OM 8930 vaccine is composed by Escherichia coli polysaccharide and it is a possible prophylactic measure, but there is doubt as to its effectiveness. We performed a systematic review in evidence-based medicine databases with rigorous bibliography selection. We found an effective decrease of recurrences in test groups. We recommend the administration of the vaccine as prophylaxis of recurrent cystitis. The vaccine has impact on the recurrent cystitis relapse rate. We suggest that more studies be carried out to evaluate the vaccine cost-benefit and its effectiveness in complicated urinary infections.
