This paper addresses the challenges and difficulties in Work-related Mental Health (WMH) Surveillance in Brazil, based on a review of the bibliographic literature. From the compilation of identified academic research, it seeks to foster reflections about the current landscape of surveillance actions, its main obstacles, and possibilities for improvement. A survey of national publications was carried out using Scielo, Lilacs and PUBMED databases from 2002 until 2017. Systematizing the results allows us to group the following themes: Epidemiology of WMH in Brazil; Policies for WMH and VISAT; Work Environment for Mental Health; and, Actions and Interventions in the VISAT and WMH. The surveillance actions are still in the early stages; however, there is an effort to strengthen the RENAST, materialized in the creation of protocols and the promotion of national meetings which reflect the construction of a new surveillance model for worker health. We noted a search for new conceptual models of mental illness, a redefinition of the focus of care, and of intervention approaches highlighting the active role of workers, who are essential players in facing the challenges in this area.
