: The study analyzed the social representations of primary health care professionals on evaluative processes of groups that work with food and nutrition, and described the educational strategies used in this care. This was a qualitative study from 2012 to 2014 in the city of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, in which 48 interviews were analyzed. In the analysis of the interviews, for classification of the educational strategies in learning categories and contents, Bogdan & Biklen and Zabala were used, respectively. The evaluative processes used the collective subject discourse technique, based on Jodelet's social representations. Three learning contents were found in the educational strategies and four social representations of the evaluative processes which combined to reveal the presence of a conflict by a practice directed by the work process to quantitative and individual evaluative criteria and a health-promoting practice that used inclusive approaches and participant evaluation. In this practice, the study implicitly identified the presence of autonomy in health. The study revealed the need to acknowledge and systematize group planning as an educational tool that qualifies and empowers comprehensive care.
