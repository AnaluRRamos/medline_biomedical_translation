to establish a correlation between objective data collected at the initial evaluation and the outcomes in cases of acute abdominal pain. we conducted a retrospective, case-control study in which we reviewed medical records of patients treated at an emergency room in 2016, diagnosed with abdominal and pelvic pain. of the 2,352 medical records evaluated, we considered 330 valid for the study. Of these patients, 235 (71.2%) were discharged and the remaining 95 (28.8%) were hospitalized, submitted to surgery, or died. The statistical analysis demonstrated that male gender, age ≥50, axillary temperature >37.3ºC, anemia, leukocytosis >10,000/mm3, neutrophil count above 7,700/mm3, lymphocyte count less than 2,000/mm3 and hyperamylasemia were variables in independently associated with worse outcome. the presence of three or more of the evaluated variables greatly increases the chances of a patient suffering the outcomes of surgery or death, the chance of death being greater the greater the number of variables present.
