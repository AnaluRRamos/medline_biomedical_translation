Describe a proposal for a conceptual model to systematize the factors affecting food environments and the ways in which these factors are expressed in food behaviors in the Chilean population. Study conducted in Chile, with four sequential and iterative stages: literature review, initial discussion of the preliminary model, development of a second model and further discussion with experts, and development of a definitive conceptual model. A conceptual model was developed, including five interrelated food environments with distinctive characteristics: domestic environment, street environment, institutional and organizational environment, restaurant environment, and food supply environment. The food system and food culture are considered the broadest variables in the model. The social determinants of the food environments and eating habits constitute structural and intermediate factors in these environments. The food industry as well as food and nutrition policies are more directly related to food environments. Finally, individuals and social cohesiveness are included in the model, since individuals and groups move within food environments. <i>Conclusions</i>. This model presents a set of definitions, concepts and relationships with complex and multidirectional interactions. The model, therefore, contributes to a comprehensive understanding of how food environments condition food behavior.
