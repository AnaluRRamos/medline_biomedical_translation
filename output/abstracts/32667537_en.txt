The scope of this article is to analyze the time-series trend and factors associated with the consumption of soft drinks or packaged fruit juices among adults in Brazil. It is a study based on secondary data from the System of Surveillance of Risk Factors and Protection for Chronic Diseases by Telephone Survey conducted among Brazilian adults between 2007 and 2014. The consumption frequency and intensity (number of cups or cans per week) of soda or packaged juice was checked. Socio-demographic and behavioral data were the independent variables. The time-series trend of annual consumption was evaluated by means of Linear Regression. The factors (age, sex, region, work, schooling and TV screen time) associated with the consumption of these beverages were investigated by Poisson regression. There was a 32.7% reduction in soft drink or packaged juice consumption between 2007 and 2014. Factors associated with higher consumption were: male sex (p = 0.000); 18-29 year-age-range (p = 0.000); residence in the central-west, southeast and southern regions (p = 0.000); lower schooling (p = 0.616); being employed (p = 0.007) and more than 3 hours of TV screen time per day (p = 0.000). The analyses describe a downward trend in the consumption of soda or packaged fruit juice among adults in Brazil from 2007 to 2014.
