Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been considered a promising strategy for controlling the global HIV epidemic. However, it is necessary to translate the knowledge accumulated from clinical trials and demosntration studies to the reality of health services and the groups most vulnerable to infection in order to achieve broad coverage with PrEP. The article proposes a reflection on this challenge, focusing on three dimensions: users of prophylaxis, with an emphasis on the contexts of sexual practices and the potential exposures to HIV; the advantages of prophylaxis as compared to other methods and the challenges for protective and safe use; and health services, considering the organizational principles to ensure greater success in the supply and incorporation of PrEP as part of combination prevention strategies. The following principles were analyzed: uniqueness of care, freedom of choice and non-hierarchization of prevention methods, sexual risk management, scheduling flexibility, and complementary and multidisciplinary care. These principles can foster organization of the health service and care, facilitating linkage and retention in care. Some comments were offered on the relative incompatibility between the existing structure of services and the Brazilian Ministry of Health guidelines for offering PrEP. The conclusion was that the success of PrEP as a public health policy depends on two essential factors: ensuring that health services are culturally diverse settings, free of discrimination, and the intensification of community-based interventions, including social networks, in order to reduce inequalities in access to PrEP and health services as a whole.
