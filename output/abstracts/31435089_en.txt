Snapping scapula syndrome manifests as an audible or palpable crackling during the sliding movements of the scapula over the rib cage, often perceived during physical or professional activities.

In this pictorial essay, we review the main causes of snapping scapula syndrome, exemplified by a collection of didactic cases.
