To verify the effectiveness of the speech language intervention in the communicative behavior in group of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia. This is a semi-experimental, quantitative analytical-exploratory study. Users of a Psychosocial Care Center III (CAPS III) with a diagnosis of schizophrenia were included, divided into 2 groups: Experimental Group (EG), comprising the Speech Therapy Intervention Group (STIG) and Control Group (CG). The communicative behavior was evaluated through the Brief MAC Battery. The STIG was performed in 2 weekly sessions, during 12 weeks, totalizing 24 sessions. After this period, individuals were reassessed. Data were analyzed through Mann Whitney non-parametric Test, and Pearson's Correlation Test. A total of 19 individuals of both sexes participated, who are between 19 and 59 years old with a minimum schooling of 5 years, 14 participating in EG and 5 in CG. In the EG, it was possible to observe that there was improvement in the communicative behavior after the speech language intervention in all the tasks evaluated, except in the writing task. In CG, no significant changes were observed comparing evaluation and reevaluation after 12 weeks. The speech-language intervention in group was effective as a socialization tool and contributing to the improvement of the living conditions of these people with schizophrenia.
