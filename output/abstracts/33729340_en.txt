This study aimed to evaluate the racial inequality on childbirth care at the Rede Cegonha (Stork Network) using obstetric good practice and interventions indicators. Racial inequality, measured by the total effect of ethnicity/skin color in the crude model, was seen in many indicators. After adjusting for mediators, such as age, schooling, parity, high-risk hospital, and geographic macro-regions, the persistent direct effect suggests racial discrimination against black women with lower partograph completion (PR 0.88; 95% CI 0.80-0.95). Black women stayed less in lithotomy (PR 0.93; 95% CI 0.89-0.98), performed less episiotomy (PR 0.81; 95% CI 0.68 - 0.96), and had less episiotomy suturing pain (PR 0.66; 95% CI 0.51 - 0.87) when compared to white women, suggesting more good practice applied to black women. However, according to the interventionist care model still adopted by many professionals, these practices are routine, and lower achievement in black women would be better interpreted as evidence of racial discrimination against these women. For other outcomes, the ethnicity/skin color effect disappeared after adjusting for mediators, suggesting mitigation or disappearance of the skin color effect in some practices/interventions in childbirth.
