This article seeks to highlight the construction of social navigation in a hospital. Our focus is to reflect on scenes of application of a questionnaire on family costs of care/treatment of children with rare diseases.

It was possible to observe remarkable characteristics of the institution, of their employees and the families, to evaluate the used methodological strategies.
