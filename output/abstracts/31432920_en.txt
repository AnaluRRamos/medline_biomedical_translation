analyze the safety culture of multidisciplinary teams from three neonatal intensive care units of public hospitals in Minas Gerais, Brazil. a cross-sectional survey conducted with 514 health professionals, using the Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture; data were subjected to a descriptive statistical analysis in software R-3.3.2. the findings showed that none of the dimensions had a positive response score above 75% to be considered as a strength area. The dimension 'Nonpunitive response to error' was classified as a critical area of the patient safety culture, present in 55.45% of the responses. However, areas with potential for improvements were identified, such as 'Teamwork within units' (59.44%) and 'Supervisor/manager's expectations and actions to promote patient safety' (49.90%). none of the dimensions was considered as a strength area, which indicates safety culture has not been fully implemented in the evaluated units. A critical look at the weaknesses of the patient safety process is recommended in order to seek strategies for the adoption of a positive safety culture to benefit patients, family members and health professionals.
