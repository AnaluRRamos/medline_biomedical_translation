The study proposes the creation of a system to monitor cases of malignant mesothelioma in the municipality of Curitiba, Paran√° State, Brazil, based on the Italian model. This diagnosis-type action-research project featured exploratory and planning phases conducted from July 2015 to May 2017. The following search tools were used: Hospital-Based Cancer Registries Integrator with specific morphologies for mesothelioma; Hospital-Based Cancer Registry with codes C38.4 and C45 of the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision, and/or records coded by the ICD-O with topographies C38 and C48; Population-Based Cancer Registry of the Curitiba Municipal Health Department, with the same codes. The study also identified, analyzed, and adapted to the Brazilian reality the model, questionnaires, and registry software for mesothelioma from Lombardy, Italy. Fifteen cases of mesothelioma were recorded in the Hospital-Based Cancer Registries Integrator. Two cases were recorded in the University Hospital-Based Cancer Registry and 16 in the Cancer Hospital. There were 317 cases recorded in the Population-Based Cancer Registry during the same period. Although some information was complete, data were lacking on patients' occupational history, thereby preventing the determination of a causal nexus. Given a predicted increase in cases of mesothelioma in the coming decades and the response to court cases, the implementation of registries has become essential to facilitate knowledge and follow-up on the determination of the causal link and specific sources of asbestos exposure in the country.
