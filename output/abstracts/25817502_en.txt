In Portugal, there are no representative data on how many people are actively trying to control their weight and which strategies and motives underlie those attempts. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of weight loss/maintenance attempts and to identify the associated behavioral strategies and motives, in a representative sample of Portuguese adults. Cross-sectional study with a sample of 1098 Portuguese adults. Sociodemographic information, anthropometric data and weight loss/maintenance strategies and motives were assessed by telephone interview. About 44% of Portuguese adults (53% women and 35% men) are actively trying to control their weight. About 22% of women with normal weight are trying to lose weight while 53% of men and 34% of women with excess weight are not trying to manage their weight. About 49% of men with higher educational level are trying to control their weight, which compares to 32% among the least educated men. The most frequently used strategy to manage weight is regular vegetable consumption and the motives most frequently reported were improving health/preventing diseases and improving wellbeing. More than half of Portuguese women and about one-third of men are actively trying to control their weight, using behavioral strategies which are generally consistent with public health recommendations. The predominant motives are related to improving health and wellbeing. This study contributes to understanding weight management in Portugal, and could be useful in the development of obesity prevention strategies that match the population profile.
