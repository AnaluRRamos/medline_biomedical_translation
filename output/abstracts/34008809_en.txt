Six-minute step test (6MST) is a simple way to evaluate functional capacity, although it has not been well studied in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) or heart failure (HF). Analyze the association between the 6MST and peak oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2peak</sub>) and develop an equation for estimating VO<sub>2peak</sub> based on the 6MST, as well as to determine a cutoff point for the 6MST that predicts a VO<sub>2peak</sub> ≥20 mL.Kg<sup>-1</sup>.min<sup>-1</sup> In 171 patients who underwent the 6MST and a cardiopulmonary exercise test, correlation, regression, and ROC analysis were used and a p < 0.05 was admitted as significant. mean age was 60±14 years and 74% were male. Mean left ventricle ejection fraction was 57±16%, 74% had CAD and 28% had HF. Mean VO<sub>2peak</sub> was 19±6 mL.Kg<sup>-1</sup>.min<sup>-1</sup> and mean 6MST performance was 87±45 steps. Association between 6MST and VO<sub>2peak</sub> was r 0.69 (p <0.001). The model VO<sub>2peak</sub> =19.6 + (0.075 x 6MST) – (0.10 x age) for men and VO<sub>2peak</sub> =19.6 + (0.075 x 6MST) – (0.10 x age) – 2 for women could predict VO<sub>2peak</sub> based on 6MST results (adjusted R 0.72; adjusted R<sup>2</sup> 0.53). The most accurate cutoff point for 6MST to predict a VO<sub>2peak</sub> ≥20 mL.Kg<sup>-1</sup>.min<sup>-1</sup> was >105 steps (AUC 0.85; 95% CI 0.79 -0.90; p <0.001). An equation for predicting VO<sub>2peak</sub> based on 6MST results was derived, and a significant association was found between 6MST and VO<sub>2peak</sub>. The cutoff point for 6MST, which predicts a VO<sub>2peak</sub> ≥20 mL.Kg<sup>-1</sup>.min<sup>-1</sup>, was >105 steps. (Arq Bras Cardiol. 2021; 116(5):889-895)
