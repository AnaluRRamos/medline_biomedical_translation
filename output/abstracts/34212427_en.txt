Papillomavirus infections in dogs have a variety of manifestations and involve multiple viral genera. Canine pedal papillomas have been infrequently studied and reported in the literature. To report the signalment, history, treatment and outcome of biopsy-confirmed cases of canine pedal papillomatosis, collected from veterinarians across the United States and Canada ANIMALS: Medical records from 44 dogs were submitted by North American veterinarians. Surveys were submitted through the Veterinary Information Network for biopsy-confirmed cases of canine pedal papillomatosis. Submissions included information on patient signalment, history, biopsy report, treatment and outcome. Forty-four cases were reviewed. The median age of presentation was four years old. Dogs most commonly presented with lameness and/or paw licking/chewing. Only one paw was affected in 35 cases, and front paws were more often affected than back paws. Twenty-eight dogs presented with one mass. Histopathological evaluation documented 33 cases of noninverted papillomas and 11 cases of inverted papillomas. Thirty-four papillomas resolved in total; 25 resolved within three weeks after biopsy collection. Twenty-one dogs received no additional treatment and 15 of those cases resolved. Azithromycin was the most commonly reported treatment initiated after biopsy was collected. The biological behaviour of canine pedal papillomas in this case series was similar to oral papillomas, and most lesions resolved with or without additional treatment. Further research is needed to better characterise the causative papillomavirus types and genera involved in the development of canine pedal papillomas.
