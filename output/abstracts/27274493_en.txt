The solid variant of aneurismal bone cysts (ABC) is considered rare. It occurs with greater frequency in pediatric patients and in the tibia, femur, pelvis and humerus. We present a case of a metaphyseal lytic lesion on the distal extremity of the radius in a child whose radiograph was requested after low-energy trauma. The hypothesis of a pathological bone fracture secondary to an aneurysmal bone cyst was suggested. After biopsy, the child underwent intralesional excision without bone grafting and the histopathological findings were compatible with the solid variant of aneurysmal bone cyst.
