Intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) is a common morbid condition in critically ill patients. Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is a severe condition that requires surgical treatment, and it is an evolution of undiagnosed and untreated IAH. This study aims to highlight the importance of clinical evidence, and proposes screening as well as medical protocols for IAH and ACS, in intensive care units. Database searches were performed and the recommended World Society of the Abdominal Compartment Syndrome standards and protocols were used. Protocols for IAH and ACS investigation, measurements, management and control, tailored for the Brazilian ICU reality, were indicated. We extensively detailed IAH medical evidence, using the most up-to-date literature about IAH care and how to measure intra-abdominal pressure (IAP), which can be easily reproduced in any intensive care unit.
