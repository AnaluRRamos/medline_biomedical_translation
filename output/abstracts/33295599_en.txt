To propose a list of congenital anomalies having corresponding codes in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10thRevision (ICD-10), with the aim of applying it in health surveillance. In December 2019, the following data sources were searched: ICD-10; ICD-11; anomalies monitored by three surveillance programs; and a database of rare diseases (Orphanet). Anomalies were retrieved from these data sources, processed to check for correspondence with ICD-10 and reviewed manually to compile the list. 898 codes were identified, of which 619 (68.9%) were contained in ICD-10 Chapter XVII. Of the 279 codes contained in other chapters, 19 were exclusive to the ICD-11 search, 72 to the surveillance programs, 79 to Orphanet and 36 to the search for terms in ICD-10. The codes contained in ICD-10 Chapter XVII do not capture the totality of congenital anomalies, indicating the need to adopt an expanded list.
