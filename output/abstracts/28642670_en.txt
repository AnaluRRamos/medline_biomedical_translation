<i>Ginkgo biloba</i> extract (EGb 761) is a plant extract obtained from the leaves of the <i>G. biloba</i> tree. The aim of this study was to assess the histological and radiological effects of <i>G. biloba</i> extract on fracture healing in an experimental fracture model using rat femurs. Forty-eight female Sprague-Dawley rats (weight: 195-252 g; age: 20 weeks) were used in the study. The rats were randomly divided into six groups (n=8). A transverse fracture was made in the middle of the right femur of each rat and fixed with a Kirschner wire. The <i>G. biloba</i> groups received 60 mg/kg oral <i>G. biloba</i> extract once daily. No medication was given to the control groups. On days 7, 21 and 35, both sets of femurs were evaluated radiologically and histopathologically. Histological evaluation revealed that the <i>G. biloba</i> groups had significant differences at 21 and 35 days (p<0.05). The <i>G. biloba</i> group showed a significant difference in terms of bone formation on day 21 when compared to the control group (p<0.05). This study indicated that the use of <i>G. biloba</i> extract accelerated fracture healing. Both radiological and histological differences were detected, but the histological differences were more remarkable. <b><i>Level of Evidence I, High Quality Randomized Trial.</i></b>
