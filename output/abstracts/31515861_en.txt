Video otoscopy is a valuable tool for the diagnosis and treatment of otitis externa (OE) and otitis media (OM) in dogs. Procedures performed by video otoscopy often are painful and it can be challenging to maintain steady anaesthetic depth and provide smooth anaesthetic recovery. A multimodal approach to analgesia and anaesthesia is ideal to minimize complications associated with high doses of anaesthetic drugs while providing the patient with adequate analgesia. To describe a technique for regional anaesthesia of the canine ear. One canine cadaver, obtained as part of a teaching laboratory class for other clinical techniques, with institutional approval, was used for illustration purposes. Clinical technique for regional anaesthesia of the canine ear. Nerve blocks for regional anaesthesia are an important aspect of a multimodal anaesthetic approach. A technique for blocking the two major sensory nerves to the canine ear is described.
