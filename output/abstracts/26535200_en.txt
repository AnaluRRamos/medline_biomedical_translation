The present study had the objective of evaluating the effect of the use of intraoperative radioscopy in cases of primary knee arthroplasty, on the final alignment of the tibial component. Patients who underwent total knee arthroplasty (TKA) between April 13, 2013, and April 20, 2013, were included in the study. These patients were evaluated retrospectively and two groups were identified: one in which intraoperative radioscopy was used to assess the positioning of the tibial component during the surgery and the other in which this resource was not used. The mean angle of alignment of the tibial component in relation to the tibial diaphysis was greater in the group without use of intraoperative radioscopy (90.82) than in the group with radioscopy (90.63), which was a statistically significant result (p < 0.05). Use of intraoperative radioscopy during TKA produced a better mean angle of alignment between the tibial component and the tibial diaphysis, in comparison with nonuse.
