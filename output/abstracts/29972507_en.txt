This article reflects on the evolution of the theme of violence within the field of public health. It provides an overview of the strategies and actions developed within Brazil's Unified Health System developed in response to the country's main guiding policy on violence, the National Policy for the Reduction of Morbidity and Mortality due to Accidents and Violence, drawing on baseline documents, national and international research, data from the country's main violence information systems, and the firsthand experiences of the authors from their participation in the abovementioned actions. Violence against children and adolescents, women, and older persons have assumed a prominent position on the health agenda, while other forms of violence, such as child labor, human trafficking, homophobic and racial violence, and violence against street dwellers and people with disabilities, who are deprived of their liberty, are gradually finding their way onto the agenda. Despite undeniable progress in institutionalizing the theme, there is a need for greater investment in various areas including out-of-hospital emergency, rehabilitation, and mental health services. It is also necessary to incorporate the theme into the training and development of all of healthcare professionals and intensify continuing training to enhance capacity for detecting and reporting violence and delivering adequate care to victims.
