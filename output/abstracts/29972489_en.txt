This article analyses the process of construction of Health Surveillance in Brazil concerning the political, historical and organizational context of this component of the Unified Health System (UHS), by means of its historical view and presentation of the advances, limits, setbacks and perspectives. Throughout trajectory of Health Surveillance, its objects of study and intervention have been expanded, strengthening the integration among the different areas of surveillance, increasing its capacity for prediction and intervention. It evolved from surveillance of people, to surveillance of diseases and now to surveillance of health risks, promoting greater articulation of HS professionals with agents of endemics and Family Health Teams. The first National Health Surveillance Conference, in February 2018, provided opportunities for discussion and formulation of proposals aimed at strengthening HS, expanding its scope of actions with a view to achieving a comprehensive care model. Adequate and audacious alternatives are necessary so that there are no setbacks in the financing modalities in order to maintain and expand the advances achieved in the field of Health Surveillance in Brazil.
