Depressive symptoms are associated with a decline of episodic memory, but the relationship with semantic memory remains unclear. The aim of the study was to analyze the relationship of depressive symptoms with the semantic memory in a community-based sample of elderly adults. The sample comprised two groups, namely, clinical (with depressive symptoms) and control. The following instruments were used General Evaluation Questionnaire, Montreal Cognitive Assessment-Basic, Wechsler Abbreviate Scale of Intelligence, Geriatric Depression Scale-30 (GDS-30), Beck Depression Inventory-II, Boston Nomination Test (BNT), vocabulary, verbal fluency test (fruits and animals), and Brief Cognitive Screening Battery. The results showed a significant difference between groups only in BNT. A significant correlation was observed between the BNT and GDS-30. Participants with symptoms of severe depression performed poorly on BNT when compared with individuals with mild symptoms. These results support the hypothesis that depressive symptoms in elderly adults can affect semantic memory and may worsen with the severity of symptoms.
