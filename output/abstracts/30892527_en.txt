The scope of this study was to identify which categories of urban waste are associated with cases of dengue and to evaluate the impact of garbage collection on dengue infection in the City of Recife (Brazil). Data from categorized waste weighing and the confirmed cases of dengue in the city were used. The data were analyzed using Pearson's correlation coefficient for the 13 categories of urban garbage, followed by Multivariate Linear Regression, selecting the variables by the stepwise method. A negative correlation between dengue infections in seven categories was identified: household garbage (r = -0.835), differentiated residues (r = -0.835), special operations residues (r = -0.711), building rubble (r = -0.687), selective waste collection (r = -0.425) and tires (r = -0.423). The regression model was able to explain 75% of the variation, indicating that an increase of 1,000 tons in household garbage collection provides a decrease of 0.032 in cases of dengue, while the same increase in tire collection esults in a decrease of 0.465. The results show that garbage collection has a strong negative impact on dengue cases and can be adopted as a prevention strategy by municipal governments.
