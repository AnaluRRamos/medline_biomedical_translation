Verbal fluency (VF) has been one of the most frequently used instruments in clinics and research, both independently or included in a battery recommended for the detection of cognitive alterations. Phonemic-verbal fluency (PVF) is an interesting variant for cognitive diagnosis particularly because studies indicate that it is less influenced by age. 1. To estimate the effects of age on PVF tests in their original forms, with the /f/-/a/-/s/ phonemes. 2. To estimate the effects of the phoneme /p/ and compare it to the original form in item generation. 3. To verify associations between the Token Test (TT), Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) and depressive symptoms on performance with /f/-/a/-/s/-/p/ phonemes. Forty-eight healthy individuals with ages ranging from 30 to 80 years were evaluated with the MMSE, TT and PVF tests. Age was correlated with the MMSE, TT and depressive symptoms. There was no association between age and performance on the fluency test, independent of the phoneme used. Among the socio-demographic factors studied, age had a significant impact on performance. There was no phoneme effect in item-generation, when comparing the traditional form of VF (/f/-/a/-/s/) and the /p/ phoneme. The traditional form of FAS is interchangeable with the modified presentation, therefore both forms may be used in clinical or research settings. PVF is a valuable approach for detecting cognitive alterations in the aged, given its stability throughout the ageing process.
