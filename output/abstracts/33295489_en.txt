This text tells the story of the launching, development, and current status of the scientific Journal Ciência & Saúde Coletiva from the perspective of who was responsible for its creation, and aims to contribute to the construction of the memory of a national journal, its possibilities, and limitations. While it is a personal statement, the theoretical perspective of narrative is employed in its elaboration, which consists of the use of a singular sequence of events, mental states, events involving human beings as characters or authors, which can be real or imaginary without losing its power as history. Authors who work with studies of narratives and scientific construction processes are reference, and the context in which the story takes place is explained. The study shows the importance of having clear goals, persistent work, and interconnection of important social actors, institutional support, and national and international cooperation in the Journal's management. The role of individuals and organizations is highlighted. The paper concludes that the Journal endorses intellectual production, ensures intellectual property, legitimizes new themes, and defines the limits of what is publishable in Collective Health, in line with its primary principles.
