To analyze trends in mortality due to diseases and conditions fully attributable to alcohol in Brazil. This was an ecological time-series study. Proportional, specific, and age-standardized mortality rates between 2000 and 2013 that were due to underlying or contributing causes fully attributable to alcohol use were analyzed by sex, ethnicity/skin color, age group, and region of residence in the country. Data on deaths were obtained from the Brazilian Mortality Information System (SIM). Prais-Winsten regression was used to analyze trends. Deaths with underlying causes and/or conditions contributing to death fully attributable to alcohol accounted for 2.5% of total deaths in the period. There were more deaths among men (3.8%) than among women (0.7%). In both sexes, there was a higher proportion of deaths in those 40-49 years old (27.9%) and those of black or pardo (mixed race) skin color (48.8%). Between 2000 and 2013, there was an upward trend in specific mortality rates attributable to alcohol in the country as a whole (average annual growth rate (AAGR) = 5.59%; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.55%-7.68%), especially in people aged less than 20 years old, in pardos (AAGR = 13.42%; 95% CI = 9.70%-17.25%), and in residents of the North region (AAGR = 17.01%; 95% CI = 14.94%-19.13%), the Northeast region (AAGR = 15.49%; 95% CI = 10.61%-20.58%), and the Midwest region (AAGR = 8.40%; 95% CI = 5.57%-11.32%). Alcohol is an important and growing cause of premature death in Brazil, especially among men, black/pardo people, and the population living in the most disadvantaged regions. This overall increase in the harmful use of alcohol reflects ethnic and socioeconomic inequalities in Brazil, and it also points to the need for population-based policies to reduce the impact of morbidity and to prevent early mortality.
