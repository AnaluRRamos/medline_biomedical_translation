This article evaluated functional recovery and mortality after surgery to repair trochanteric fracture with regard to treatment technique through one year of follow-up. Eighty consecutive patients with trochanteric fractures were divided into two groups according to treatment technique (osteosynthesis and arthroplasty). We evaluated patient data including age, sex, time to surgery, total hospital stay, transfusion volume, and functional status according to FIM (Functional Independence Measure) scores. Scores for FIM were assessed three times: prior to fracture, six months after surgery, and one year after surgery. Patients who received osteosynthesis had shorter hospital stays than arthroplasty patients. The arthroplasty group had significantly higher functional independence six months after surgery, while no difference was detected one year after surgery. Patient age, transfusion volume, and FIM scores were detected as significant predictors of mortality. Trochanteric fractures lead to unavoidable functional loss, although this can be reduced in the short term by treating with arthroplasty instead of osteosynthesis. Age, transfusion and functional situation predict one-year mortality for patients with trochanteric fractures. The patient's functional situation must be considered when choosing treatment for trochanteric fractures in order to reduce patient morbidity. Level of Evidence II; Therapeutic prospective study.
