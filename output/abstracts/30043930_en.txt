To describe and interpret the experience of breastfeeding among women who underwent mammoplasty surgery prior to motherhood. A descriptive, qualitative study developed with women attended at a Human Milk Bank between 2014 and 2015. Data analysis was based on the content analysis method and supported by the Interactive Theory of Breastfeeding. 13 women participated in the study. Four categories emerged: 1) Success (or lack thereof) in Exclusive Breastfeeding: influence of maternal and child biological conditions; 2) Maternal feelings: perception about breastfeeding; 3) Decision making on the continuity of breastfeeding or the use of formula; 4) The role of health professionals in protecting, promoting and supporting breastfeeding: Information (or lack thereof) on the implications of the surgery. Unfavorable biological conditions of the women who underwent mammoplasty generated unsuccessful experiences in exclusive breastfeeding and limited their decision-making, despite their desire to breastfeed.
