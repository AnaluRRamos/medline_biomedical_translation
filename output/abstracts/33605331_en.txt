This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of prediabetes and intermediate hyperglycemia in Brazilian adults, according to different diagnostic criteria, and establish associated factors to its occurrence. We analyzed the National Health Survey laboratory data collected from 2014 to 2015. The prevalence of the conditions was calculated according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) diagnostic criteria based on glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) 5.7%-6.4%, and the World Health Organization (WHO) 6-6.4%, among those without criteria for diabetes. Crude and adjusted prevalence rates (PR) and 95% CI were calculated using Poisson regression with robust variance. The prevalence of prediabetes by ADA and WHO criteria was 18.5 and 7.5%, respectively. We observed a gradient of increased prevalence by the age of the population and risk factors, like arterial hypertension, obesity, elevated waist circumference, and low HDL cholesterol levels. Less educated people and the self-declared black had a higher prevalence. This study pointed out a range from 7.5 to 18.5% of Brazilian adults with prediabetes and intermediate hyperglycemia and identified a risk score to this condition's occurrence.
