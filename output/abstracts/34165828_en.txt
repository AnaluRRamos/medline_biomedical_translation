Next-generation sequencing techniques have revealed that human and animal skin is colonised by a rich and diverse population of bacteria, and that microbial composition varies between different body sites and individuals. Very little is known about the normal microbiota of healthy equine skin. To describe the taxonomic distributions of cutaneous bacterial microbiota in a population of healthy horses in Ontario, Canada, and to evaluate the effects of body site, individual and time of year on microbial diversity and community composition. Samples were collected from four body sites (dorsum, ventral abdomen, pastern and groin) from 12 clinically healthy horses from the same farm. Samples were collected from all individuals at four time points (winter, spring, summer, autumn) within a calendar year. Illumina sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was performed following DNA extraction. Data were analysed using mothur software. Bacteria from 38 phyla and 1,665 genera were identified. Alpha diversity was higher in the winter and summer than spring and autumn although this was not statistically significant. Community membership and structure clustered more based on season than skin site. Healthy equine skin is inhabited by a marked diversity of microbiota. Individuals living in a similar environment share overlapping cutaneous microbial populations. These populations vary significantly over time and between body sites.
