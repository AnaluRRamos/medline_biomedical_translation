This paper aimed to characterize actions directed to children's mental health (CMH) in Primary Health Care (PHC), based on an integrative review of Brazilian literature (2006-2017). The searches were carried out from LILACS, SciELO and VHL Network databases. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 13 articles were identified for analysis, which were presented in three thematic axes: 1) Characterization of the demands on CMH for PHC; 2) Actions and interventions on CMH carried out in PHC; and 3) Difficulties and propositions for the implementation of actions on CMH in PHC. The literature points, as the main actions, the identification of CMH problems and their referral to care by specialties. Some studies described specific actions of professionals such as physicians, pediatricians, and psychologists. Interventions of a local character or in partnerships with universities were also identified. The analysis of this material indicated that PHC has been considered as an important field of action in CMH, but that nevertheless requires greater investments, especially in professional training and work organization.
