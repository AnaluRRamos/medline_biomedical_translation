In the context of crisis and resource constraints, it is reasonable to assume the deteriorated weaknesses of the Unified Health System (SUS), such as regional inequalities, underfinancing, and care quality issues. This study explored the application of easily comprehensible and calculated access and effectiveness indicators that could reflect the hospital network crisis. Five indicators extracted from the Hospital Information System, related to Brazil and states of the Southeastern region, were analyzed in the 2009-2018 period: hospitalizations resulting in death; surgical hospitalizations resulting in death; elective surgeries in the total of surgical hospitalizations; hip prostheses in the senior population; and angioplasties in the population aged 20 years and over. Statistical control charts were used to compare indicators between states, before and from 2014. In Brazil, overall hospital deaths had a slight increase while surgical deaths declined; elective surgeries and hipprosthesis also decreased. In Southeastern Brazil, Rio de Janeiro was the worst performer, especially the decrease of the elective surgeries. The results illustrate the potential of indicators to monitor crisis effects on hospital care.
