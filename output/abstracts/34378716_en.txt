Neuropsychiatric drugs are used for a wide variety of neurological and psychiatric conditions. This article aims to analyze the trend and determinants of public expenditure of these medicines in Minas Gerais, from 2010 to 2017. Data from the Integrated Materials and Services Administration System (SIAD) database were used to estimate volumes of acquisition and expenditure. A breakdown analysis was performed, and the list of purchased drugs was reviewed, and the Drug Utilization technique (DU90%) applied concerning anti-Parkinson drugs. Annual expenditure dropped by 36%, from R$ 111.7 million in 2010 to R$ 40.9 million in 2017, and the determinant factors were the falling prices and volume, associated with changes in the drug mix, which favored the acquisition, on average, of more expensive products. Higher levels of expenditure for anti-Parkinson drugs stand out, however, with a significant change in the list purchased. This study contributed to a better understanding of public spending on neuropsychiatric drugs. A reduced volume can increase the risk of shortages. Regarding anti-Parkinson drugs, there is no evidence to suggest an increased supply to the population.
