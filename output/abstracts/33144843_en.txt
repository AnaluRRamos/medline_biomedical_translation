To evaluate the effect of lateral lumbar interbody fusion (LLIF) or oblique interbody fusion (OLIF) on low back pain due to degenerative intervertebral disc disease. We systematically reviewed articles on surgical treatment of low back pain by LLIF and OLIF, according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We searched through electronic databases, including Medline via PubMed, Lilacs through the Virtual Health Library (VHL), Cochrane Collaboration/Central and Cohrane/Dare Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, without language or publication date restrictions and with design for prospective cohorts and randomized clinical trials. We have selected and presented three studies. The literature review showed great relevance in the improvement of the new surgical approach (LLIF) in relation to TLIF, but greater content availability in the databases is necessary to reach a satisfactory conclusion regarding the efficiency of the lateral approach and its advantages over other traditional procedures. <b><i>Level of Evidence II, Systematic review of Level II studies.</i></b>
