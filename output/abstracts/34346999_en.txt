Scientific policy in Brazil has neglected the human and social sciences, especially in terms of investing in research. With the arrival of covid-19, efforts have focused on minimizing the impact of this health crisis on the country's social and economic life. In the scientific arena, this involved research financing and professional qualification grants that prioritized technological areas while restricting opportunities for researchers from the social, human, and artistic sciences. Here we maintain that Brazil's scientific policy is out of step with international scientific development programs, and has a limited view of what science is, as well as its role in the nation's development.
