Propose a protocol for instrumental assessment of adult speech considering psychometric and linguistic criteria. The choice of words was based on previously defined Brazilian Portuguese linguistic criteria after a search on the 'Portal da LÃ­ngua Portuguesa' database using the Portuguese Orthographic Vocabulary (VOP). The defined linguistic criteria considered grammatical class, vowel context, number of syllables, stress, and presence of words in the daily life of Brazilian adults. The choice of the images to represent the words considered the criteria of imageability, clearness, and cultural aspects. The words and images were rigorously evaluated by 13 non-specialist judges and six specialist judges. After being examined by the judges, the words were tested in adults through instrumental assessment. The protocol was composed of 19 words and images, with prevalence of nouns over adjectives. Each word included one target sound in Onset Medial position, in the context precedent and following the vowel [a], trisyllabic and paroxytone words. The adults that attended the instrumental assessments succeeded in producing the list of words spontaneously. The data obtained through the assessments provided adequate analysis. This study provided additional information on psychometric and linguistic criteria in addition to providing a protocol for instrumental assessment of adult speech.
