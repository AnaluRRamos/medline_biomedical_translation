This article presents new approaches for investigating the past using digital technologies. 'Pauliceia 2.0: collaborative mapping of the history of SÃ£o Paulo (1870-1920)' is an open-source project intended to broadly engage with the public through collaborative methodologies. This text discusses the concept, current status, and prospects of this project, and presents it as a case study to discuss the relationship between digital technologies and historical methods. The product of this journey (at least the outcome intended by the authors and the other team members listed at the end of the article) is meant to assign new meaning to the project at the juncture between digital humanities, public history, and open science.
