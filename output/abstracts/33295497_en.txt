The Journal Ciência & Saúde Coletiva appeared in the 1990s simultaneously to essential events that addressed the relationships between production, environment, health, and development, which generated an essential set of initiatives and scientific production and contributed to the development of Health and Environment in Brazil. We analyzed the papers published on this topic over the past 25 years to examine this Journal's contribution to the field. We examined 24 volumes and 170 issues and supplements of the Journal from 1996 to 2019. The texts were classified according to 4 domains. A total of 243 texts were included in the analysis, which represents about 5% of all scientific production published on the Journal's pages in the period. The production is quite varied, highlighting discussions about inequalities, vulnerabilities, development or economic aspects related to environmental issues and their impacts on health, the analysis of the production system and its relationship with health, and the predominance of studies on pesticides. We concluded that production in this field has been growing and tending to include affected territories, populations, and communities to produce this knowledge.
