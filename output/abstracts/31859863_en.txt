This study was multicenter with a qualitative approach, which sought to identify the elements that can increase or reduce the workloads of the Family Health nurse. Forty nurses were interviewed, from 36 teams from five regions of Brazil, considered successful according to the requirements of the National Policy of Primary Care and with good evaluation in the National Program for Improvement in Primary Care Access and Quality. Data collection was performed by instrument triangulation, using a semi-structured interview, observation and documentary study, from 2013 to September 2016. The findings were analyzed based on the Thematic Content Analysis and categorized with the help of Atlas.ti software. It was identified that the elements that most influence the increase of the workloads are the precariousness and deficits in the work environment, materials and equipment, added to the numerical deficit of the workforce and the excess of health care demand. However, teamwork, recognition for the performed work, bonding with users and good interpersonal relationships, all contribute to reduce the workloads. We highlight the dialectic present in the elements of the work process. They can increase or decrease workloads influenced by objective conditions, the moment and way they are handled.
