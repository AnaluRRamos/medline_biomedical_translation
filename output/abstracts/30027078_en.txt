To evaluate the labral height and pullout resistance after the repair of Bankart lesions in the glenohumeral joint of swine models, using double-loaded anchors with two suture configurations: simple and Mason-Allen. Ten swine shoulders were used, in which Bankart lesions were created. For each specimen, the lesion was sutured randomly with Mason-Allen sutures or simple sutures. The labral height was measured before the lesion was created and after the labral repair. The specimens were submitted to a tensile test for biomechanical evaluation. In specimens submitted to simple suture (<i>n</i> = 5), the mean labral height observed before the lesion was 3.86 mm, and after suturing, 3.33 mm. In specimens submitted to Mason-Allen suture (<i>n</i> = 5), it was observed that the mean labral height before the lesion was 3.92 mm, and after suturing, 3.48 mm. When comparing the labral height after simple suture and Mason-Allen suture, no significant difference was observed. The pullout force at the end of the tensile test on specimens with single suture was 130 N, and in specimens with Mason-Allen suture, 128.6 N. No statistically significant differences were observed between the shoulders treated with single suture and Mason-Allen suture; <i>p</i> = 0.885. Repair of Bankart lesions with Mason-Allen suture provides increased labrum height; however, it does not increase the pullout strength.
