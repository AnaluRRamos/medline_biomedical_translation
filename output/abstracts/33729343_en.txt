This study aims to evaluate the birthplace of preterm infants with less than 34 gestational weeks at birth by type of neonatal care service in maternity hospitals of the 'Rede Cegonha' and estimate the maternal factors associated with the inadequate place of birth for gestational age. This national cross-sectional study was performed in 2016/2017 to evaluate health establishments with the Rede Cegonha's action plan. Information was analyzed from 303 puerperae and the respective health establishments of their births. Newborns were classified by gestational age at birth (<30 and 30-33 weeks) and health establishments as hospitals with neonatal intensive care service, hospitals with intermediate neonatal care service, and hospitals without neonatal care service. Ministerial Ordinance NÂ° 930/2012 was used to classify the birthplace as appropriate for the newborn's gestational age. Preterm birth prevalence was 37.3 at less than 30 weeks' gestation and 66.8 at 30-33 weeks. Birth in inappropriate services for the newborn's gestational age occurred in 6.3%, with significant regional and social differences. Inequalities in access to neonatal care for preterm infants persist in the 'Rede Cegonha' despite advances.
