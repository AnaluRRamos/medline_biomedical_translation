Hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) ia s devastating hyperinflammatory syndrome. Heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) status is closely correlated with increased inflammation, both systemic and intramyocardial. This study sought to determine mortality predictors and reliable follow-up parameters in HPS that developed HFpEF during the clinical course. Thirty-nine patients, diagnosed as HPS, according to HLH 2004 diagnostic criteria, with an HScore of â‰¥169 and proven bone marrow aspiration or biopsy, were recruited retrospectively. Both traditional, serum C-reactive protein, albumin and ferritin levels with lymphocyte, and platelet counts, as well as non-traditional risk factors, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte count (NLR), monocyte-to-lymphocyte count (MLR), mean platelet volume (MPV), and N-Terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP), were investigated retrospectively. The relationship between time-changed laboratory values both among themselves and with mortality. The overall significance level was set at 5%. This study showed that temporal change of cardiothoracic ratio (CTR), serum NTproBNP, ferritin, CRP, and albumin levels were detected as mortality predictors (p<0.05, for all) in the univariate analysis. Lymphocyte and platelet counts with NLR and MPV values were also significant (p<0.05). The relationship between NT-proBNP and increased systemic inflammatory markers proved to be significant. In addition to traditional risk factors, serum ferritin levels, NLR, MLR, and MPV levels also proved to be significantly correlated with each other. Accompanied by reliable follow-up parameters, rapid diagnosis and aggressive anti-inflammatory treatment with tight volume control can be life-saving in HPS patients who suffer from HFpEF. Close monitoring of inflammation may predict the outcome of patients suffering from HFpEF.
