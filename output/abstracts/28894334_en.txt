Diagnostic imaging is crucial to the diagnosis and monitoring of spondyloarthropathies. Magnetic resonance imaging is the most relevant tool for the early detection of sacroiliitis, allowing the institution of therapeutic strategies to impede the progression of the disease. This study illustrates the major criteria for a magnetic resonance imaging-based diagnosis of spondyloarthropathy. The cases selected here present images obtained from the medical records of patients diagnosed with sacroiliitis over a two-year period at our facility, depicting the active and chronic, irreversible forms of the disease. Although computed tomography and conventional radiography can also identify structural changes, such as subchondral sclerosis, erosions, fat deposits, and ankylosis, only magnetic resonance imaging can reveal active inflammatory lesions, such as bone edema, osteitis, synovitis, enthesitis, and capsulitis.
