The study analyzes the structural characteristics of primary health care (PHC) in its contextual and organizational dimensions in remote rural municipalities (counties) in Northern Minas Gerais State, Brazil. This is a case study with a qualitative approach, using 21 semi-structured interviews with health system administrators and health care workers from the family health teams (EqSF), as well as secondary data. For the contextual dimension, the results show that socioeconomic factors in the remote rural municipalities condition the organization of PHC and leave the population vulnerable, especially in the rural areas of the remote municipalities. As for the organizational dimension, the principal characteristics are: coexistence of formal and informal assignment of the services' users, two modalities of first-contact services, namely basic health units (UBS) and 24-hour health centers; prioritization of response to the spontaneous demand; strong action by the Family Health Support Centers in the development of activities in promotion and prevention, expanded scope of practices by community health workers; partial guarantee of transportation for persons in treatment; partial computerization of the UBS with the implementation of the electronic patient record (e-SUS), telecardiology; and the More Doctors Program. The study found that remote rural municipalities are not a uniform unit, since the municipal (county) seat and the rural areas are unequal in terms of living conditions and lack specific organization, policies, and financing to guarantee access to PHC. With all the limitations, the observations show initiatives with major difficulties in maintenance and sustainability and sometimes without necessarily corresponding to the use of space and social life that define rural health itineraries.
