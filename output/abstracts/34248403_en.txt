To analyze the functional outcomes after arthroscopic treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI). 194 patients (131 males and 63 females), with a mean age of 39 (15-68) years old for men and 43 (16-58) years old for women. The average follow-up was 17 months (2 to 71). 103 patients presented Cam-type FAI, 102 mixed and 25 Pincer. 'Unilateral' arthroscopy was performed in 161 cases, 'Bilateral' (only once each side) in 46 cases and, 'Multiple' (more than one procedure on the same hip) in 23. The female sex was prevalent in the Pincer type FAI (76%), while males were prevalent in Mixed and Cam type, 74.5% and 72.8%, respectively. The mean HHSpre score was 63.7 and 87.1 for HHSpost, i.e. 73.11%. Differences appeared between 'mixed' and 'unilateral' groups. The complications percentage in this series was 18.7% and 7% progressed to total hip arthroplasty. The arthroscopic FAI treatment improved the postoperative clinical scores of these patients, especially in cases of mixed-type FAI, which presented a higher improvement rate. Insufficient femoral osteoplasty was the main cause for surgical re-intervention, particularly in the initial cases of this series. <b><i>Level of Evidence II, Retrospective study.</i></b>
