In this article, we analyzed the National School Feeding Program (PNAE) as a Healthy Public Policy (HPP). The Brazilian Law No 11,947/2009 established that at least 30% of the resources from the National Fund for Educational Development (FNDE) for school feeding must be employed in purchasing food from family farming. In addition, a HPP is a public policy whose formulation takes into account different domains that determine the population's health. The demand for purchasing food from family farming includes not only the appreciation of organic and local agricultural production of family farmers, but also the prioritization of a healthy diet for students, thus contributing to shape healthy eating habits. In view of this, the PNAE contributes to health promotion and hence can be understood as a HPP. The PNAE, by the articulation of actions from different sectors, makes public policy more effective and more efficient, generating positive results beyond health and maximizing the returns for society. In order to improve and strengthen the PNAE, in this article we propose mechanisms that aim to complement and reinforce actions carried out in SUS (Brazilian Unified Health System, called Sistema Único de Saúde).
