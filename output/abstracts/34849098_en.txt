The aim of this study is to purpose a novel approach to the concomitant triplanar and tibial shaft fracture. Retrospective study between 2001 and 2019. We collected the patients' general information, clinical and radiographic data, and complications after the following three-step treatment: (1) fixation of the Salter-Harris II fracture of the triplane fracture, (2) fixation of the Salter-Harris II/IV fracture with cannulated screws, and (3) fixation of the tibial fracture with flexible titanium nails. The study included seven patients (six males) with a mean age of 14 years and a mean follow-up of 6.4 years (minimum two years). Five triplane fractures had two fragments and two had three fragments. Five fractures were classified as Salter-Harris II and two as Salter-Harris IV. Three tibial fractures were long oblique, three were spiral, and one had a third fragment. Six fractures affected the middle third and one affected the distal third of the tibia. All triplane and tibial fractures consolidated without significant displacement. No physeal damage was identified. This study described the association of tibial fractures with triplane ankle fractures managed by our proposed treatment, which proved to be effective for this fracture association. <b><i>Level of Evidence IV, Case Series.</i></b>
