To evaluate the efficacy of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and tranexamic acid (TXA) applied in total knee arthroplasty. We selected and randomized 84 patients. TXA was applied in 23 patients, PRP in 20, and PRP in combination with TXA in 20. Hemoglobin was measured preoperatively and 24 and 48 hours postoperatively. The function questionnaire, pain scale and gain of knee flexion were monitored until the second postoperative year. There was a difference (p <0.01) in the decrease in hemoglobin 48 hours after surgery between the TXA group and the control and PRP groups. In terms of pain, the TXA group at 24 and 48 hours after surgery and the PRP group at 48 hours after surgery showed advantages (p <0.01). Knee flexion gain in the first 24 hours postoperatively was better in the TXA group (p <0.05). TXA was effective in lowering the drop in hemoglobin level, reducing pain and improving movement gain 48 hours after the procedure. PRP was not effective in reducing bleeding or improving knee function after arthroplasty, but provided better control of postoperative pain. <b><i>Level of Evidence I, Randomized, blinded, prospective clinical trial.</i></b>
