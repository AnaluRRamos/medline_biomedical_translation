Statin use is highlighted as the most commonly utilized therapy for the treatment of dyslipidemias and can be considered as the most efficient pharmacological intervention for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) reduction. On the other hand, physical training can be considered an efficient and safe non-pharmacological strategy to promote improvements in lipid profile. However, the influence of statins on lipid adaptations arising from water-based training in populations with dyslipidemia is not known. To analyze the influence of simvastatin use on lipid adaptations arising from water-based aerobics and resistance training in elderly women with dyslipidemia. Sixty-nine elderly (66.13 ± 5.13 years), sedentary, and dyslipidemic women, both non-users and users of simvastatin (20 mg and 40 mg), were randomized into the following 3 groups: water-based aerobic training (WA), water-based resistance training (WR), and control group (CG). Total duration of interventions, for all experimental groups consisted of 10 weeks, with 2 weekly sessions. Biochemical analyses were performed before the beginning of the interventions and repeated after the end of the trial. Generalized estimating equations were used to compare these data, setting α = 0.05. In intention-to-treat analysis, the medicated participants obtained a greater magnitude of decrease in total cholesterol (TC) (−3.41 to −25.89 mg.dl<sup>−1</sup>; p = 0.038), LDL (−5.58 to −25.18 mg.dl<sup>−1</sup>; p = 0.007) and TC/HDL ratio (−0.37 to −0.61; p = 0.022) when compared to the non-medicated participants, and this decrease was statistically significant only in the WR group. Statin use enhances the adaptations promoted by water-based physical training in CT, LDL levels, and CT/HDL ratio, and it is more pronounced after WR.
