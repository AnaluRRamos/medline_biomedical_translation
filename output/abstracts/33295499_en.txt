Noncommunicable Diseases are an important public health issue in Brazil and worldwide. This study aimed to analyze the scientific production published by the 'Journal Ciência & Saúde Coletiva' in order to shed light on its contributions for the dissemination of scientific knowledge and the debate regarding noncommunicable diseases. A bibliometric study on the publications from 1996 to 2019 related to noncommunicable diseases was carried out. A total of 458 documents that met the eligibility criteria were selected. An increasing trend in the number of publications per year was found; at some points, it coincided with political and institutional milestones in Brazil. Quantitative research papers stood out, as did studies on risk and protective factors. Public educational and research institutions led the publishing and the financing of the studies. Most authors were female. The journal has been reflecting the magnitude of the theme and its prioritization on the public agenda by promoting the debate and providing a scientific dissemination of content related to noncommunicable diseases.
