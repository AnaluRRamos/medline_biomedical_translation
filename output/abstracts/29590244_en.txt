The study proposes a differentiated approach to the localization of public services (unlike methods focusing solely on locational efficiency in the distribution of such services), with a nonlinear model that incorporates an accessibility indicator and allows rejecting solutions in which accessibility fails to comply with acceptably established minimum parameters. The method aims to minimize the total time spent by a region's population to reach a public services network, while controlling the range between the highest and lowest accessibility to the services. The resulting solution is not as efficient as other models (e.g., p-median) in relation to total cost for the population as a whole to access the system, but it seeks to prevent the most distant areas from experiencing greater difficulty due to their disproportional traveling time. The model was tested in a region in the hospital network of the State of Santa Catarina, Brazil, and the results show that incorporation of the indicator suggests improvement when compared to the current distribution of hospitals in that area. The proposed methodology can be a useful tool for planning balanced resource allocation during installation of health services for the population.
