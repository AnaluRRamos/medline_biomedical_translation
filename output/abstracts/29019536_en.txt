to study the correlation of trauma mechanism with frequency and severity of injuries in blunt trauma patients. retrospective analysis of trauma registry in a 15-month period was carried out. Trauma mechanism was classified into six types: occupants of four-wheeled vehicles involved in road traffic accidents (AUTO), pedestrians struck by road vehicles (PED), motorcyclists involved in road traffic accidents (MOTO), falls from height (FALL), physical assault with blunt instruments (ASSA) and falls on same level (FSL). Injuries with AIS>2 were considered severe. One-way ANOVA, Students t and Chi-square tests were used for statistical analysis, considering p<0.05 significant. trauma mechanism was classified by group for 3639 cases, comprising 337 (9.3%) AUTO, 855 (23.5%) PED, 924 (25.4%) MOTO, 455 (12.5%) FALL, 424 (11.7%) ASSA and 644 (17.7%) FSL. There was significant difference among groups when comparing the Revised Trauma Score (RTS), the Injury Severity Score (ISS) and the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) of the head, thorax, abdomen and extremities (p<0.001). Severe injuries in the head and in the extremities were more frequent in PED patients (p<0.001). Severe injuries to the chest were more frequent in AUTO (p<0.001). Abdominal injuries were less frequent in FSL (p=0.004). Complex fractures of the pelvis and spine were more frequent in FALL (p<0.001). Lethality was greater in PED, followed by FALL and AUTO (p<0.001). trauma mechanism analysis predicted frequency and severity of injuries in blunt trauma patients.
