To verify if there are differences in the vocal aspects of older people from three different age groups with presbyphonia diagnosis. Sixty older adults joined this study. They were both female and male, with an age range from 60 to 90 years old (average: 72.3) and with presbyphonia diagnosis established after otolaryngology evaluation. From their voice recordings, it was possible to make the acoustic and auditory-perceptual analysis. The data collected was compared through statistical tests considering the division of the participants into the following groups: 60-70 years old, 71-80 years old, and 81-90 years old. Even though the older people from all of the three groups have presented deviation in multiple vocal aspects such as instability and vocal noise in low frequencies, those with more than 80 years old have presented a higher deviation of the general grade of dysphonia, roughness, breathiness, and pitch. In this group, it was also observed higher deviations in jitter, shimmer, vocal breaks, and the GNE measure on the edge of normality. All the differences were statistically significant. The majority of the older participants from that group presented even a deviation in the phonatory deviation diagram and frequency break. Various acoustic and auditory-perceptual aspects had a higher deviation in the older adults over 80 years old, which reinforces the need to consider those specificities in the evaluation of the vocal aging impacts and also in the development of actions to minimize vocal declination.
