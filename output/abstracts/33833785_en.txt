To identify patient- and provider-related factors associated with the success of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) treatment in the six municipalities of Colombia with the highest number of MDR-TB cases. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to analyze the association between treatment success (cure or treatment completion) and characteristics of the patients and physicians, nursing professionals, and psychologists involved in their treatment. The importance of knowledge in the management of MDR-TB cases was explored through focus groups with these providers. Of 128 cases of TB-MDR, 63 (49.2%) experienced treatment success. Only 52.9% of the physicians and nursing professionals had satisfactory knowledge about MDR-TB. Logistic regression showed that being HIV negative, being affiliated with the contributory health insurance scheme, being cared for by a male physician, and being cared for by nursing professionals with sufficient knowledge were associated with a successful treatment outcome (<i>p</i> â‰¤ 0.05). Qualitative analysis showed the need for in-depth, systematic training of health personnel who care for patients with MDR-TB. Some characteristics of patients and healthcare providers influence treatment success in MDR-TB cases. Physicians' and nurses' knowledge about MDR-TB must be improved, and follow-up of MDR-TB patients who are living with HIV and of those affiliated with the subsidized health insurance scheme in Colombia must be strengthened, as these patients have a lower likelihood of a successful treatment outcome.
