To analyze whether association between bone fragility and risk of fracture depends on the trauma level. All participants along with their mothers underwent DXA scan and body measurements. The subjects answered a self-report questionnaire about their physical activities and the precipitating causes. The questionnaire results were associated with DXA performed at the baseline visit. A total 374 children with available DXA scan and complete follow-up of 5 years were included in the final analysis. Of the 374 children, 53 (14.2%) had one fracture, and 11 (20.7%) had more than one fracture. Based on the modified Landin classification, the trauma level was determined. Of the 53 (14.2%) children who had one fracture, 39 (73.6%) were classified, namely 19 (48.7%) with mild trauma, 16 (41%) with moderate trauma and four (10.2%) with severe trauma. Trauma level could not be assigned to 14 (26.4%) children due to limited information. Children without fractures had significantly higher values in all bone parameters compared to those with fractures caused by mild trauma. Subjects with mild trauma fractures had an inversely proportional ratio between bone fragility parameters and fracture risk compared with subjects without fractures. <b><i>Level of Evidence IV, Case Series.</i></b>
