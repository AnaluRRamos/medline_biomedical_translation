To compare serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels, a serum marker of vitamin D3, between patients with and without proximal hip fracture. This was a case-control study in which serum samples of 25(OH)D were obtained from 110 proximal hip fracture inpatients and 231 control patients without fractures, all over 60 years of age. Levels of 25(OH)D lower than or equal to 20 ng/mL were considered deficient; from 21 ng/mL to 29 ng/mL, insufficient; and above 30 ng/mL, sufficient. Sex, age, and ethnicity were considered for association with the study groups and 25(OH)D levels. Patients with proximal hip fracture had significantly lower serum 25(OH)D levels (21.07 ng/mL) than controls (28.59 ng/mL; <i>p</i> = 0.000). Among patients with proximal hip fracture, 54.5% had deficient 25(OH)D levels, 27.2% had insufficient levels, and only 18.2% had sufficient levels. In the control group, 30.3% of patients had deficient 25(OH)D levels, 30.7% had insufficient levels, and 38.9% had sufficient levels. Female patients had decreased serum 25(OH)D levels both in the fracture group and in the control group (19.50 ng/mL <i>vs</i>. 26.94 ng/mL; <i>p</i> = 0.000) when compared with male patients with and without fracture (25.67 ng/mL <i>vs</i>. 33.74 ng/mL; <i>p</i> = 0.017). Regarding age, there was a significant association between 25(OH)D levels and risk of fracture only for the age groups 71-75 years and above 80 years. Patients with proximal hip fracture had significantly decreased serum 25(OH)D levels when compared with the control group. Female patients had significantly lower serum 25(OH)D levels in both groups.
