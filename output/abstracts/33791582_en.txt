Researchers have surmised that the ability to obtain dominance during reproduction is related to an individual's ability to better sequester the energy required for reproductive behaviors and develop secondary sexual characteristics, presumably through enhanced physiological performance. However, studies testing this idea are limited. Using sockeye salmon (<i>Oncorhynchus nerka</i>), we explored the relationship between heart rate and dominance behavior during spawning. We predicted that an individual's reproductive status and energy requirements associated with dominance can be assessed by relating routine heart rate to changes in spawning status over time (i.e., shifts among aggregation, subordinance, and dominance). Thus, we used routine heart rate as a proxy of relative energy expenditure. Heart rate increased with temperature, as expected, and was higher during the day than at night, a known diel pattern that became less pronounced as the spawning period progressed. Routine heart rate did not differ between sexes and average heart rate of the population did not differ among reproductive behaviors. At the individual level, heart rate did not change as behavior shifted from one state to another (e.g., dominance versus aggregation). No other trends existed between routine heart rate and sex, secondary sexual characteristics, survival duration or spawning success (for females only). Therefore, while our study revealed the complexity of the relationships between cardiac performance and reproductive behaviors in wild fish and demonstrated the importance of considering environmental factors when exploring individual heart rate, we found no support for heart rate being related to specific spawning behavioral status or secondary sexual characteristics.
