The study sought to identify dietary patterns and associated factors of elderly Brazilians. It involved a cross-sectional study based on data from the National Health Survey ('PNS/2013') of 11,177 elderly individuals, whose dietary patterns were identified by cluster analysis. Poisson regression with robust variance was used for the analysis of associated factors. The cluster analysis produced 2 clusters of dietary patterns, one healthy (55.4%), with greater consumption of raw and cooked vegetables and legumes, chicken, fruits, natural fruit juices and milk. And an unhealthy cluster (44.6%), with greater consumption of red meat and soft drinks or artificial juices. The prevalence of the healthy dietary pattern was greater for females (PR = 1.32, 95% CI 1.25- 1.40), Caucasian (PR = 1.09, 95% CI 1.02-1.15), elderly individuals with graduate or post-graduate degree (PR=1.56, 95% CI 1.41-1.72), living in the Southeast (PR = 1.54, 95% CI, 1.33-1.79) and South (PR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.30-1.76), non-smokers (PR = 1.19, 95% CI, 1.07-1.31) and physically active (PR = 1.24, 95% CI, 1.17-1.32). These results indicated an association between better social conditions and beneficial life habits with the consumption of healthy foods, reinforcing the hypothesis of social determination and the coexistence of health behaviors.
