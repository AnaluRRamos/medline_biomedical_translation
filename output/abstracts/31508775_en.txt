The paper introduces and discusses the new players that now have a growing presence on the research scene, namely the entrepreneurial researcher and the entrepreneurial university. It also discusses the current scenario of the diffusion of scientific knowledge that presents increasing problems, with difficulty in publishing results and difficulties in accessing the results of published research. It also discusses the implications of the strategy of translational research and presents and discusses some relevant ethical challenges that result from the reorganization of the relationship between science and business. In particular, it deals with conflicts of interest and the results of excessive competition between scientists and institutions in a scenario of diminished public financial support for science.
