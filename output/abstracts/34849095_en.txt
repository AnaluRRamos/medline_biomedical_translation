To compare the application of partial meniscectomy concomitant with primary ACL reconstruction, using the graft from the patellar tendon with individuals who underwent only ACL reconstruction, in clinical functional criteria and degree of osteoarthritis (OA), after 10 years of the surgical process. This is a retrospective cross-sectional study with 37 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction with a graft from the patellar tendon, associated or not with partial meniscectomy, divided into 2 groups: with meniscal injury (n = 22) and without meniscal injury (n = 15). Anthropometric data and four outcome measures were used to analyze the results: SF-36 questionnaire, arc of motion assessment, Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and AhlbÃ¤ck Radiographic Classification. No differences were found for health-related quality of life, arc of motion, functional condition and knee OA severity/grade in patients who underwent partial or no meniscectomy in conjunction with ACL reconstruction (p > 0.05). Participants who underwent partial meniscectomy in conjunction with primary ACL reconstruction with a graft from the patellar tendon, after 10 years of the surgical process, showed no significant differences in the clinical functional criteria and severity of knee OA, compared to individuals who underwent only ACL reconstruction. <b><i>Level of Evidence II, Prognostic study.</i></b>
