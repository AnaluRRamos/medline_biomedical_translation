To analyze the elements present in the missions of Brazilian hospitals accredited with an international standard of excellence. Mission elements were obtained from the websites of the Brazilian hospitals accredited with an international standard of excellence. Of eight elements proposed by Pearce II (1982), the most relevant and frequent elements for the mission of hospitals were mentioning products and services and their competition. The studies also identified elements that are required but were not found in any of the missions analyzed, namely, geographical domain, survival, growth or profitability, and concern for public image. It is possible to observe that none of the missions analyzed presented the eight elements proposed by Pearce II (1982) to become efficient. This can affect the purpose of the organization, which is defined through its mission, thus compromising its role as an essential element of strategic planning.
