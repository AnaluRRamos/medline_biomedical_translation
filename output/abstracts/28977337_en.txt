To critically examine the existing Brazilian and International scientific literature regarding the influence of short lingual frenulum over growth and development of the stomatognathic system, as well as how it impacts the achievement of the shape-function balance. An electronic literature search was conducted in databases, including MEDLINE/PubMed, Google Scholar, LILACS, SciELO, and ScienceDirect, using the key words 'lingual frenum' and 'development', as well as their equivalents in Brazilian Portuguese. The literature search yielded 51 papers published between January 1997 and the present date; 14 articles of clinical trials were selected for meeting the inclusion criteria and were read in full. The integrated literature review supported the proposition that some malocclusions are closely related to the presence of ankyloglossia and, although very few clinical trials on this topic have been published so far, there is a consensus among authors concerning the negative effects of functional imbalances over the stomatognathic system's proper growth and development. Half of the studies found state that surgical interventions for releasing the lingual frenum are both safe and effective, concerning improvement in breastfeeding scores. Moreover, 4 out of the 14 studies included in this integrated review, report a negative influence of ankyloglossia over the orofacial muscular system. There is a consensus among the authors concerning the negative effects of lingual frenulum's anatomic and functional alterations over craniofacial growth and development. The opinion about the early surgical intervention, however, is not unanimous.
