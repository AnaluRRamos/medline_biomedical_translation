The aim of this study was to evaluate functional independence and trunk control during maximum-range tasks in individuals with spinal cord injuries, who were divided into sedentary (SSI, n=10) and physically active (PASI, n=10) groups . Anamnesis was conducted and level and type of injury were identified (according to the American Spinal Injury Association protocol, ASIA) and the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) questionnaire was applied. For the forward and lateral reach task, the subjects were instructed to reach as far as possible. Mean data were compared using the unpaired t test and Mann-Whitney test and differences were considered significant when p<0.05 . The PASI group performed better in self-care activities (PASI: 40.8±0.42 points, SSI: 38.0±3.58 points, p=0.01), sphincter control (PASI: 10.5±1.84 points, SSI: 8.2±3.04 points, p=0.02), transfers (PASI: 20.7±0.48 points, SSI: 16.9±4.27 points, p=0.04), and total FIM score (PASI: 104.0±2.30 points, SSI 105.1±8.56 points, p=0.01). On the maximum reach task, the PASI group had a greater average range in all directions evaluated (p<0.05) . The continuous practice of exercise increased motor function independence and trunk control in individuals with complete spinal cord injury. Level of Evidence II, Prospective Comparative Study.
