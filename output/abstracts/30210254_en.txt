Patients with metastatic bone lesions have a limited life expectancy. These metastatic lesions compromise the proximal femur, and fractures are quite common. The survival of these patients depends on the behavior of the primary tumor. The aim of this study was to evaluate the quality of life of patients with extensive metastatic lesion of the proximal femur with pathological or imminent fracture, treated with non-conventional endoprosthesis. From May 2008 to August 2012, twenty-five (25) patients with bone metastases of the proximal femur, with pathological or imminent fracture were recruited into this study. These patients had survived for at least six weeks after surgery and the TESS questionnaire (Toronto Extremity Salvage Score) was administered. The final score of the TESS was an average of 57 points (SD 23.78 points). There was no significant difference in TESS values considering: sex, presence of fracture, or site of the bone lesion. The TESS questionnaire provides information about the function and quality of life of patients with malignant tumors of the lower limbs, from the patient's perspective. The results can be considered positive, when compared to the limited life expectancy and complexity of this group of patients. <b><i>Level of evidence III, Therapeutic studies, retrospective comparative study.</i></b>
