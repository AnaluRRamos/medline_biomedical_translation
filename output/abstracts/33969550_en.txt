A period of isolation in allopatry typically precedes local adaptation and subsequent divergence among lineages. Alternatively, locally adapted phenotypes may arise and persist in the face of gene flow, resulting in strong correlations between ecologically-relevant phenotypic variation and corresponding environmental gradients. Quantifying genetic, ecological, and phenotypic divergence in such lineages can provide insights into the abiotic and biotic mechanisms that structure populations and drive the accumulation of phenotypic and taxonomic diversity. Low-vagility organisms whose distributions span ephemeral geographic barriers present the ideal evolutionary context within which to address these questions. Here, we combine genetic (mtDNA and genome-wide SNPs) and phenotypic data to investigate the divergence history of caecilians (Amphibia: Gymnophiona) endemic to the oceanic island of São Tomé in the Gulf of Guinea archipelago. Consistent with a previous mtDNA study, we find two phenotypically and genetically distinct lineages that occur along a north-to-south axis with extensive admixture in the centre of the island. Demographic modelling supports divergence in allopatry (~300 kya) followed by secondary contact (~95 kya). Consequently, in contrast to a morphological study that interpreted latitudinal phenotypic variation in these caecilians as a cline within a single widespread species, our analyses suggest a history of allopatric lineage divergence and subsequent hybridization that may have blurred species boundaries. We propose that late Pleistocene volcanic activity favoured allopatric divergence between these lineages with local adaptation to climate maintaining a stable hybrid zone in the centre of São Tomé Island. Our study joins a growing number of systems demonstrating lineage divergence on volcanic islands with stark environmental transitions across small geographic distances.
