To translate into Brazilian Portuguese and conduct the cross-cultural adaptation of the 'Injury Report Form for Rugby Union' questionnaire. This is a cross-sectional study, level of evidence II, with following the steps: translation; synthesis; back-translation; review by a committee of experts and pre-final version; pre-test to verify comprehension; elaboration of the final version of the instrument and clinical application. The two versions resulting from the translation and adaptation process did not show great differences. The pre-final version was filled by 23 male rugby players; three questions were not understood by 40%, 27% and 82.5% of the players, respectively, which required a new meeting with a multidisciplinary committee of experts. The modifications were made, requiring then a new application. The new version was filled by 25 male rugby players, aged 29.44 ± 5.90 years; of which 56% had complete higher education; finalizing the process of cross-cultural adaptation. The questionnaire 'Formulário para Notificação/Avaliação de Lesão em Jogadores de Rugby' was translated and transculturally adapted into Brazilian Portuguese. <i>Level of Evidence II, Diagnostic Studies - Investigating a Diagnostic Test.</i>
