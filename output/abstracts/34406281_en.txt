To analyze health service utilization and associated factors among university students. This was a cross-sectional study conducted with a sample of 2,708 students at the Federal University of Pelotas between November 2017 and July 2018. Of the 1,865 individuals included in the study, 55.8% used health services in the last 12 months, 39.3% used specialized services, and 22.6% used health centers; 45.9% used services funded by the Brazilian National Health System (SUS); 49.1% used health services for the purposes of prevention. There was greater use among females (prevalence ratio, PR=1.34 - 95%CI 1.23;1.46) and students with health needs (PR=1.51 - 95%CI 1.40;1.63). Greater association was found with SUS-funded services: primary health care center (83.0% [95%CI 77.3;87.5]), accident and emergency (81.3% [95%CI 73.2;87.5]) and urgent care center (83.6% [95%CI 76.2;89.0]). The analysis indicated that women and people with health needs use health services more and that the SUS is the main service provider.
