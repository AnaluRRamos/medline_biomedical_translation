Ameloblastomas are odontogenic tumors that are locally invasive and slow-growing. Their etiology is still not well defined, but the forms of treatment have been widely discussed because of the possibility of tumor recurrence and postoperative complications. In this study, six patients who were diagnosed with ameloblastoma in the mandibular region and were treated in the Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology of Hospital das Clínicas, Federal University of Goiás, between 1958 and 1963, were evaluated. The radiological, clinical and therapeutic characteristics were evaluated. There was no predominance regarding gender in the sample studied. The symptoms most often presented by the patients were pain and tumor formation. The radiological characteristics with greatest incidence were multilocular lesions and the treatment used for all the patients was radical surgery. There was no recurrence over the minimum follow-up period of one year and six months.
