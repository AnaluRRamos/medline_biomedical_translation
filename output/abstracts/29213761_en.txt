Cholinesterase inhibitors (ChE-Is) are among the main drugs approved for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Rivastigmine in the form of a transdermal patch is an alternative delivery method, and can give greater treatment compliance. To conduct a preliminary assessment of the neurocognitive and biological effects of oral and transdermal Rivastigmine in patients with AD and to identify a potential biological marker and demonstrate a possible relationship between esterase levels and behavioral scores of AD patients. Forty patients with AD were treated with cholinesterase inhibitors (ChE-Is), evaluated using the MMSE and NPI, and simultaneously sampled to determine their serum levels of AChE and BuChE for 180 days. The differences obtained between oral and transdermal forms, as assessed by the MMSE and NPI scores of the AD patients, were not significant at the three time points examined (0, 90, and 180 days). However, serum BuChE levels of the transdermal group differed significantly (p<0.0004) compared with those of the oral group at 90 days. Use of a transdermal ChE-I, rivastigmine tartrate significantly reduced BuChE levels in the AD patients studied.
