Analyze results with respect to cortisol reactivity (CR) in experimental stress paradigms in adults with or without a psychiatric disorder who suffered violence in early developmental stages (infancy or early adolescence); and use these results to propose a clinical tool to determine biological stress indicators. A systematic review was conducted using several databases and following PRISMA criteria; of a total of 231 articles, 16 satisfied the inclusion criteria and the results were analyzed qualitatively. Despite heterogeneity, the results suggested that the people who suffered violence at an early age present a pattern of low CR. In contrast, people who also developed symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, regardless of the type of violence, showed increased CR. The majority of studies focused on people who suffered childhood sexual abuse and half of the articles supported the hypothesis that CR is more pronounced in men than in women. The results of this review suggest that cortisol hyperreactivity can be considered a biomarker for treatment and intervention in people with post-traumatic stress disorder and depression who suffered violence at an early age. The results also support evidence that experiencing violence alters stress response and mental health in the long term. However, it is necessary to conduct more studies, in particular studies on hyporeactivity and gender differences.
