Most stress fractures occur in the lower limbs and are rarely observed in the upper limbs. The second metacarpal is the longest of all the metacarpals and has the largest base, articulating with the trapezium, trapezoid, capitate, and third metacarpal. In athletes, stress fractures in non-weight bearing joints are uncommon. Therefore, the shaft of the second metacarpal bone undergoes a higher load - the maximum tension at the base of the second metacarpal is amplified when the hand grasps a tool such as a tennis racquet.
