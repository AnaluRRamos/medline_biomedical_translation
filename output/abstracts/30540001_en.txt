Analyzing quantitative and qualitative aspects of school meals represents the initial stage to ensure that the National School Food Program (PNAE) is an effective space for the promotion of healthy eating habits and establishing individual rights. The objective of this study was to evaluate the nutritional adequacy of meals served and consumed, as well as quantifying food waste in Child Daycare Centers in Macei√≥, in the state of Alagoas. All meals served and consumed by 359 children (aged 17 to 63 months) were analyzed by the direct weighing method for three non-consecutive days in all institutions. Food waste was determined by the leftover factor and the nutritional value of meals served and consumed was compared to the PNAE reference values regarding energy, carbohydrates, protein, lipids, vitamins A and C, iron, calcium, zinc, magnesium and fiber. Of the 85 meals/preparations featured on the menu, 58 (68%) revealed a high leftover percentage; in excess of 10%. The meals served and consumed met approximately 50% of the recommended energy and macronutrient values. The difference between the averages of the nutrients offered and consumed was statistically significant (p < 0.05) for fiber, vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, iron and zinc.
