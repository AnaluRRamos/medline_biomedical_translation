Occupational aspects have been described as additional risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). Workers whose job interferes with healthy eating and physical activity might be more susceptible to disease. To investigate sociodemographic, clinical, occupational and lifestyle factors associated with DM2 among employees of a public hospital in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Cross-sectional study with 443 employees of a public hospital in Belo Horizonte. We administered a sociodemographic and occupational questionnaire and the Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (FINDRISC) and collected biochemical data. We performed multivariate logistic regression analysis to investigate factors associated with diabetes. The significance level was set to 5%. 6.3% of the participants had a diagnosis of DM2 and 13% were found to be at high or very high risk to develop disease within 10 years. Participants aged above 54, with abnormal waist circumference, who took antihypertensive drugs or had family history of diabetes exhibited higher odds of developing disease. Older age, abdominal obesity, hypertension and family history of diabetes were associated with diagnosis of DM2.
