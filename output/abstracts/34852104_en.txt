The scope of this study was to analyze the prevalence and the factors associated with sufficient leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) among Brazilians diagnosed with hypertension, diabetes and/or hypercholesterolemia. It involved a representative, cross-sectional population-based study for the entire Brazilian territory. Adults aged 20 years and over were interviewed. Prevalences were estimated and, by means of logistic regression, the crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR) of the outcome were calculated in accordance with each of the exploratory variables. The prevalence of sufficient LTPA was 15.9%, 15.3% and 21.4% among people with hypertension (n=12,228), diabetes (n=3,577) and hypercholesterolemia (n=7,124), respectively. These values were lower than those observed among adults who did not report one of the three diseases. Adjusted analysis showed that individuals with positive self-perception of health and with more schooling, who reported a public space near their homes for physical activity, the existence in the city of public programs that encourage physical activity and the recommendation of health professionals to practice LTPA, were associated with a greater chance of being sufficiently active.
