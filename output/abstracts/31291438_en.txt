to describe the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), long term (current) drug therapy, blood pressure levels and capillary glycemia among a nursing team at a charitable hospital in Pelotas/RS. This was a cross-sectional study. The questions were adapted from the Vigitel system questionnaire (Telephone Surveillance of Chronic Disease Risk and Protection Factors). All participants had their blood pressure and blood glucose measured. Of the 272 staff assessed, 29.4% reported having NCDs, 48.9% were on long term (current) drug therapy and 73.9% reported a family history of NCDs. Among those interviewed, 20.6% reported using antihypertensive drugs, of these 27.7% had high blood pressure levels, and 2.6% reported using antihypoglycemic agents, 42.9% of whom had high blood glucose. Among those professionals who stated they had high blood pressure and diabetes, those who were on medication had higher blood pressure and glucose levels than those who were not on medication.
