The scope of this study is to present an integrative review of the prevalence of the use of phytotherapy during pregnancy. A review of the topic was made by research in the Scielo, Medline and Science Direct databases using the following key words: 'herbs and pregnancy,' 'plant and gestation,' with their respective terms in Portuguese. Forty-six articles published between 2000 and 2015 met the study's inclusion and exclusion criteria and were included in this review. Of these, 11 were carried out in Europe, 10 in Asia, 5 in Africa, 3 in Oceania, 16 in America and only one of which was a multinational study. In most of these (67.39%), the interview method was used. A substantial variability in the prevalence of phytotherapy use was reported in the articles. In addition, camomile, ginger, garlic, mint and echinacea were the species most used by pregnant women. Despite the socioeconomic and ethnic-cultural variables among women worldwide, phytotherapy use during gestation is a widespread practice.
