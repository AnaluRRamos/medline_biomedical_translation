To evaluate and compare anatomical measurements of C7, T1 and T2 vertebrae in children from 3 to 12 years of age to provide useful epidemiological data for determining the safe anatomical margin for transpedicular and translaminar fixation with screws in this population. This observational retrospective cross-sectional study evaluated 76 computed tomography scans obtained over 6 months, analyzing the following parameters: the angle of attack, length, thickness and diameter of the pedicle; and the angle of attack, length and thickness of the lamina. The lamina length and thickness, as well as pedicle length varied in size according to age. Although the angle of attack was similar across different ages, age-dependent variation occurred in the T1 vertebra. Screws with a 3.5 mm diameter are safe to use in the C7 and T2 pedicles, while the T1 pedicle allows the introduction of larger screws ranging from 3.5-4.5 mm in diameter. In the lamina, 3.5 mm screws are safe for use only in children older than 7 years. However, each case should be analyzed individually, with the present study not aiming to replace the preoperative use of CT. <b>Level of Evidence III, Retrospective comparative study.</b>
