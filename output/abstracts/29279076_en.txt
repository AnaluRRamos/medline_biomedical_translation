Bowel preparation for colonoscopy and/or colorectal surgery can cause electrolyte imbalances. The risk of electrolyte imbalances seems to be related to the type of bowel cleansing solution, age of patients and comorbidities. We report two cases of symptomatic hyponatremia (focal neurological signs and coma) after bowel preparation with sodium picosulfate/magnesium citrate for colonoscopy. In both cases, symptoms related to hyponatremia rapidly disappeared after sodium level correction with intravenous administration of hypertonic saline (3% NaCl). Electrolyte imbalances are more common with sodium phosphate-based solutions (NaP) and sodium picosulfate/magnesium citrate, in patients older than 65, in patients treated with thiazide diuretics, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, betablockers or antidepressants and in gastrectomized patients. These patients should use macrogol-based solutions (polyethylene glycol). In patients at risk (patient > 65 years old, patients taking thiazide diuretics, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers and antidepressants and with previous gastrectomy) we recommend macrogol-based solutions.
