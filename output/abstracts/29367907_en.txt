Synthetic adhesives are used by various medical specialties, especially in surgery; however, studies reporting their use in orthopedic practice are scarce. The aim of this study was to compare the results in using ethyl-2-cyanoacrylate or butyl-2-cyanoacrylate in the treatment of fractures in rats. This was an experimental prospective controlled study in 90 rats, with humerus, femur, and tibia fractures, treated with ethyl-2-cyanoacrylate (SB group; <i>n</i> = 45) or butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (HA group; <i>n</i> = 45). Biomechanical and histomorphometric analyses were performed at three different moments (60, 120, and 180 days); besides a clinical study performed weekly by measurement of the animals body mass. No differences were observed regarding body mass (<i>p</i> = 0.07). In both groups, there were no significant differences regarding maximum load (<i>p</i> = 0.6), yield point strength (<i>p</i> = 0.6), and stiffness coefficient (<i>p</i> = 0.4) of the femurs. The same was observed in tibias for maximum load (<i>p</i> = 0.4), yield point strength (<i>p</i> = 0.7), and stiffness coefficient (<i>p</i> = 0.6). The humerus from both groups had similar bone callus area (<i>p</i> = 0.66). In both groups, there were no statistical differences related to inflammatory cells (<i>p</i> = 0.4), osteoblasts (<i>p</i> = 0.2), and osteoclasts (<i>p</i> = 0.2). Ethyl-2-cyanoacrylate was more effective than butyl-2-cyanoacrylate in the treatment of fractures in rats.
