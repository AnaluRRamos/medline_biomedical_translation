The populations of lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transvestites, and transsexuals (LGBTT) have not had a place in the 'official history' of humanity, except as secondary actors that deviate, distort, or even tarnish popular memory, guided by cisheteronormativity. These same subjects often experience obstacles in the care provided by the Family Health Strategy (ESF) within a universal, comprehensive, and equitable system. This paper seeks to analyze experiences narrated by primary care professionals in health care for LGBTT populations in Teresina, Piau√≠, Brazil. This is qualitative research conducted with 32 professionals working at a PHC unit. The analysis was based on three dimensions - relational, organizational, and contextual - inspired by the Giovanella and Fleury theoretical discussion. Primary care, which should be one of those responsible for community health actions and prioritize health promotion and prevention, is the same that has provided denials, violence, and neglect in the care of LGBTT people. Therefore, we selected listening as one of the keys to respecting sexual and gender diversity so that these people are recognized as ESF users.
