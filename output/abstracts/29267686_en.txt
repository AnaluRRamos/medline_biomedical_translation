The article presents an analysis of contributions and challenges associated with bodily practices and meditation for health promotion in the public primary care system. The qualitative study was developed in 16 healthcare units in the city of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, using interviews with 29 health professionals and 36 practitioners of bodily practices and meditation, including participant observation of 31 practices such as Tai Chi, Lian Gong, Qigong, Yoga, Capoeira, Dance, Meditation, Relaxation, Mindfulness, and Body Awareness. There was an improvement in joint pain, mobility, balance, memory, depression, and anxiety, besides greater ease in coping with chronic conditions. Such contributions are related to favoring practitioners' autonomy, building health references through self-awareness; the combination of health promotion and therapeutic care in the approaches; and support for access to cultural goods and community spaces. The challenges identified here were precarious integration with the supply of other health services, lack of supervision and evaluation, and the predominance of a health-sector culture.
