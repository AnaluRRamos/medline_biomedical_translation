To analyze the impact of Resolution 2.173/2017 of the Federal Council of Medicine on results from the Central Estadual de Transplantes de Santa Catarina. This was a cross-sectional observational study of medical records of all patients (1,605) with suspected brain death notified to the Central Estadual de Transplantes de Santa Catarina; for this study, procedures to confirm this diagnosis were initiated between July 2016 and December 2017 and between January 2018 and June 2019. The median duration of the protocol in each period was considered for the comparison between the intervals. The collected data were transformed into rates (per million population). The mean rates for the periods before and after the implementation of the protocol were analyzed by Student's t-test, and qualitative variables were analyzed by Pearson's chi-squared test. The mean duration of brain death confirmation procedures decreased more than 1 hour in the second period compared to the first period, with statistical significance (p = 0.001). The rates of harvested livers and transplanted pancreas, the number of notifications by hospital size and the rate of cardiac arrest in the macro-region of the Itaja√≠ Valley were significantly different between the two periods. In the period after the new resolution on brain death, there was a reduction in the duration for diagnosis. However, other indicators did not change significantly, providing evidence for the multidimensional nature of the organ transplantation process in Santa Catarina and the need for further studies to better understand and optimize the process.
