The basal forebrain complex (BFC) is a small but intricate structure. Its organization and function is hard to investigate using conventional methods, especially in humans. By combining new methods of research we present a comprehensive overview of this complex, in order to better understand its function in normal and diseased brains. The right and left BFC of a 29-year-old male were reconstructed from gallcocyanin (Nissl) stained 440 Âµm-thick serial horizontal sections by using advanced computer-assisted 3D reconstruction software. The reconstructed components in the present case include Ch2, Ch3, Ch4am-al, Ch4i, Ch4p, juxtacommissural, Ayala's medial (subpallidal) and lateral (periputaminal) subnuclei. These components are arranged in an arch-like course mainly beneath the anterior commissure. The bilateral volume of all subnuclei was 99.06 mm<sup>3</sup>, the left side accounting for 48.05 mm<sup>3</sup>. Some of the subnuclei exhibited volume asymmetry indices varying from 28.3 to 12.9%.The volume of Ayalas' lateral or periputaminal nucleus was 9.7% higher on the right, than on the left side. Our methodological approach promises to be highly efficient and reproducible in studying morphofunctional correlations in complex cognitive features.
