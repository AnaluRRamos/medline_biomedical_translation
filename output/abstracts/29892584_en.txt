The use of open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) for unstable pelvic injuries is associated with extensive blood loss, iatrogenic neurovascular injury, and infection. Moreover, the placement of sacroiliac (SI) screws is a blinded procedure, guided primarily by palpation and two-dimensional radiological screening, which demands expertise. The complex three-dimensional anatomy of SI joint and its proximity to neurovascular structure require a safe and precise technique. Computed tomography (CT)-guided SI joint stabilization allows an accurate intra-operative assessment of screw placement. This study demonstrated a technique of CT-guided closed reduction and screw fixation of the SI joint in unstable pelvic fractures. This was a retrospective non-randomized cohort study conducted at a tertiary care hospital. Six patients with unstable pelvic fractures were operated; the anterior rim was stabilized first by ORIF with plate on the superior and anterior aspects of the pubic symphysis. Subsequently, the posterior stabilization was made percutaneously under CT guidance with a 7-mm cannulated cancellous screw. The mean operative time was 48 min (35-90 min), the mean effective radiation dose was 9.32 (4.97-13.27), and the mean follow-up was 26 months (6-72 months). All patients had satisfactory healing, with near-anatomic reduction and no complications, except in one case where the plate broke at 61 months post surgery, but no intervention was required. The mean VAS score at the final follow-up was 1.8, and all patients returned to their original occupation without any limitations. CT-guided SI joint stabilization offers many advantages, including safe and accurate screw placement, reduced operating time, decreased blood loss, early definitive fixation, immediate mobilization, and fewer infections and wound complications.
