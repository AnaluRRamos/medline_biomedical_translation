Primary lung tumors in the pediatric age group are rare, histologically diverse and have different therapeutic approaches. The inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor of the lung accounts for 0.04% - 1.2% of all lung tumors, is more common in children and young adults and its etiology is unknown. The diagnosis is difficult as clinical and radiological findings are highly variable. We report a case of a 15-year-old adolescent who presented with a single pulmonary nodule on a chest radiograph, in the context of a respiratory infection, and whose etiological investigation revealed an inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor of the lung. Atypical resection was performed by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, with full recovery. We highlight the rarity of this entity, the need for a high suspicion index and the diagnostic investigation undertaken to reach a definitive diagnosis and a successful outcome.
