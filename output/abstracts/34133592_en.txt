The non-invasive quantification of the fractional flow reserve (FFRCT) using a more recent version of an artificial intelligence-based software and latest generation CT scanner (384 slices) may show high performance to detect coronary ischemia. To evaluate the diagnostic performance of FFRCT for the detection of significant coronary artery disease (CAD) in contrast to invasive FFR (iFFR) using previous generation CT scanners (128 and 256- detector rows). Retrospective study with patients referred to coronary artery CT angiography (CTA) and catheterization (iFFR) procedures. Siemens Somatom Definition Flash (256-detector rows) and AS+ (128-detector rows) CT scanners were used to acquire the images. The FFRCT and the minimal lumen area (MLA) were evaluated using a dedicated software (cFFR version 3.0.0, Siemens Healthineers, Forchheim, Germany). Obstructive CAD was defined as CTA lumen reduction ≥ 50%, and flow-limiting stenosis as iFFR ≤0.8. All reported P values are two-tailed, and when <0.05, they were considered statistically significant. Ninety-three consecutive patients (152 vessels) were included. There was good agreement between FFRCT and iFFR, with minimal FFRCT overestimation (bias: -0.02; limits of agreement:0.14-0.09). Different CT scanners did not modify the association between FFRCT and FFRi (p for interaction=0.73). The performance of FFRCT was significantly superior compared to the visual classification of coronary stenosis (AUC 0.93vs.0.61, p<0.001) and to MLA (AUC 0.93vs.0.75, p<0.001), reducing the number of false-positive cases. The optimal cut-off point for FFRCT using a Youden index was 0.85 (87% Sensitivity, 86% Specificity, 73% PPV, 94% NPV), with a reduction of false-positives. Machine learning-based FFRCT using previous generation CT scanners (128 and 256-detector rows) shows good diagnostic performance for the detection of CAD, and can be used to reduce the number of invasive procedures.
