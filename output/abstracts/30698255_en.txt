The scope of this article was to analyze the evolution of knowledge about Toxocara sp. from a zoonotic point of view by means of scientific data published between the years 1996 and 2015 using epistemology as a tool. The epistemological analysis of the evolution of knowledge on the zoonotic aspect of Toxocara sp. in Brazil revealed that, in general, little new information was added which had, over the period studied, slow and discontinuous absorption, and was not incorporated in the social reality from the standpoint of public health.
