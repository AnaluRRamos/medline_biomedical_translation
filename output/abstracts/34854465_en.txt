To analyze ecological association between socioeconomic, occupational and sanitation characteristics and scorpionism in Brazil. This was an ecological study with data on scorpion sting accidents reported on the Notifiable Health Conditions Information System (2007-2019). Negative binomial regression was used to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRR) and confidence intervals (95%CI). In the study period there were 1,079,333 scorpion sting accidents, with a cumulative incidence rate of 41.5/100,000 inhabitants. In the adjusted analysis, there was association with the municipal percentages of: women (IRR=1.65 - 95%CI 1.18;2.30) and men (IRR=0.90 - 95%CI 0.88;0.91) working in the construction industry, women (IRR=1.21 - 95%CI 1.18;1.25) and men (IRR=0.73 - 95%CI 0.69;0.77) working in domestic service, women (IRR=1.03 - 95%CI 1.02;1.04) and men (IRR=0.93 - 95%CI 0.92;0.93) working in farming, households with refuse collection (IRR=0.99 - 95%CI 0.98;0.99) and households with refuse left nearby (IRR=1.02 - 95%CI 1.01;1.02), expected years of schooling (IRR=0.88 - 95%CI 0.83;0.92), and unemployment rate (IRR=1.07 - 95%CI 1.05;1.09). Scorpionism was associated with precarious infrastructure/sanitation, job availability, education and female occupation.
