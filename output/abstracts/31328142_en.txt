Neurosarcoidosis is a rare manifestation of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, mainly in patients exposed to interferon-based therapies. Although we are living in a new era of HCV treatment, there is still little data concerning the treatment of extrahepatic complications of the disease with direct antiviral agents, especially rare ones such as neurosarcoidosis. We present a rare case of central nervous system vasculitic lesions in the context of chronic HCV infection associated with mixed cryoglobulinemia, elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels, and documentation of viral RNA in the cerebrospinal fluid in a treatment-naïve chronic HCV patient. Successful treatment with an interferon-free regimen improved all clinical manifestations, reduced the levels of serum ACE, and reduced the cryoglobulin levels to undetectable. Neurosarcoidosis and cryoglobulinemia are rare but well-recognized complications of HCV infection, even in treatment-naïve patients. Direct antiviral agents can be useful in the management of this condition.
