To analyze frequency of condom use according to vulnerability factors for sexually transmitted infections in quilombola communities in Sergipe state, Brazil. This was a descriptive cross-sectional study carried out in 2016-2017. A structured questionnaire with sociodemographic and behavioral questions was used; rapid HIV and syphilis tests were performed. Comparisons between categorical variables were performed using Fisher's exact test. Among the 367 individuals from 14 communities, the majority had low levels of education (72.8%), were not working (59.7%) and had a stable sex partner (90.7%). Lack of access to prevention supplies and information accounted for respondent programmatic vulnerability. There was a higher proportion of inconsistent condom use with a stable partner (90.1%) among individuals who reported lack of access to information (p=0.001) and inconsistent use with a casual partner (p<0.001). Frequency of condom use with a stable partner was significantly proportional to condom use with a casual partner and access to information on prevention.
