To evaluate bone mass by quantitative ultrasound of the phalanges in young karate practitioners compared to a control group. Sample composed of 162 karate practitioners (52 females) and 326 healthy controls (110 females) aged 6 to 16 years old, in Western Paraná (Southern Brazil). Weight, height, BMI, amplitude-dependent speed of sound (AD-SoS) and bone transmission time (BTT) were evaluated. BMI, AD-SoS and BTT values were converted to Z scores. Mann-Whitney, chi-square or Fisher Exact tests and multiple linear regression were applied, with significance level set at p≤0.05. Both genders showed higher values of BTT as Z scores when compared to control group. Females from the control group had higher AD-SoS values (m/s and Z score) compared to female karate practitioners. When relative and absolute frequencies were assessed according to BTT Z score in both groups, male karate practitioners' bone mass was shown to be adequate more frequently. In female practitioners, age and weight were independent predictors of AD-SoS (R2=0.42) and BTT (R2=0.45), respectively. Among male karate practitioners, age was related to 26% of AD-SoS variances and height was responsible for 36% of BTT variances. Children and adolescents who practice karate were shown to have more bone mass in comparison to the control group, regardless of gender. BTT was more sensitive for this evaluation.
