Virtual chromoendoscopy (VC) in small bowel capsule endoscopy can improve the visualization and characterization of different small bowel lesions (SBLs). There are few studies of its usefulness in the Given速 system, and there is no evidence yet of its utility in the MiroCam速 system. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether VC can improve the characterization of SBLs with the MiroCam速 system. Twenty-two patients were selected, in which 100 elementary lesions were identified, including erosions (<i>n</i> = 45), ulcers (<i>n</i> = 17), and angioectasias (<i>n</i> = 38). For each lesion identified, images were captured without chromoendoscopy (normal image [NI]) and with chromoendoscopy modes 1 (color mode [CM] 1), 2 (CM2), and 3 (CM3). A score from 1 to 4 was assigned to each image, in which a better evaluation of the characteristics and limits of the lesion was classified in ascending order, where 1 is the worst and 4 the best evaluation. The scores of the various modes were compared with Kendall's tau-c coefficient. The average scores attributed to the photographs in NI, CM1, CM2, and CM3 were 3.83, 2.89, 1.85, and 1.43, respectively (tau-c = -0.75, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Evaluating the elementary lesions independently, the average scores for modes NI, CM1, CM2, and CM3 were 3.83, 2.92, 1.86, and 1.38 (tau-c = -0.77, <i>p</i> < 0.001) for erosions, respectively; 3.87, 2.96, 1.76, and 1.40 (tau-c = -0.80, <i>p</i> < 0.001) for ulcers, respectively; and 3.81, 2.82, 1.87, and 1.50 (tau-c = -0.71, <i>p</i> < 0.001) for angioectasias, respectively. VC using the CMs available in the MiroCam速 system has not proven useful for a better assessment of any of the SBLs.
