This article analyzes high school education reform and its impact on the education project on those who work for a living. By analyzing Law 13.415/2017, recent statistics and the new proposal for curricular organization, arguments will be identified that point to the flexibilization of high school education as an expression of the pedagogical project of the flexible accumulation system, whose logic continues to be the unequal distribution of knowledge, but in a differentiated way. The aim is the formation of flexible subjectivities submitted to the precarity of work, naturalizing instability, insecurity and deregulation for an alleged autonomy of choice. From the ontological viewpoint, the article shows that the high school education reform responds to the alignment of the flexible accumulation system formation. In epistemological terms, it compares the conception of praxis that guided the drafting of the curricular guidelines in 2012 with the dimensions of individualism, fragmentation, presentism and pragmatism present in the new guidelines. Based on the analysis, the author emphasizes the need to create other forms of curricular organization in the exercise of autonomy by the school as an alternative for the integral formation of young individuals.
