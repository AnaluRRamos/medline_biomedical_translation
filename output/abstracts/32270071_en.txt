Metallurgical and metal-mechanic companies stand out within this sector as a function of the frequency of leaves resulting from work-related accidents and illnesses. To analyze the occupational profile and hazards associated with work accidents at a metal-mechanic company for the period from 2007 to 2015. Cross-sectional study that analyzed data available in work accident report forms issued by the employer. Thesociodemographic and occupational profile predominantly associated with work accidents at the investigated company included: male gender, age 18 to 29 years old, white people, married or in stable union, with incomplete higher education, welders/assemblers and less than 5years of work at the company. The most frequent types of injuries caused by accidents were fractures, dislocations, strains, contusions, excoriations, cuts and amputations. The most common causative agents were metal parts. The highest accident rates corresponded to 2008 and 2012, in which years economic recession hit the metal-mechanic segment. In addition to pointing to an economic sector with a high-risk work accident profile, the analyzed work accidents - the predominant consequence of which was leave for more than 15 days - might express a selective strategy from the company, which chose not to record less serious accidents.
