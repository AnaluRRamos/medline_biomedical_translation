Agrammatism is characterized by morphosyntactic deficits in production of sentences. Studies dealing with the treatment of these deficits are scarce and their results controversial. The present study describes the rehabilitation of a case diagnosed as chronic Broca's aphasia, with agrammatism, using a method directed to sentence structural deficits. The method aims to expand the grammatical repertoire by training production of sentences with support from contexts that stimulate actions and dialogues. The patient showed positive results on all types of sentences trained and generalized the gains to spontaneous speech. However, these benefits were not sustained in the long term.
