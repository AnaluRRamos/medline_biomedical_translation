To analyze the association between the coverage of psychosocial care centers (CAPS) and Primary Health Care (PHC) and the number of psychiatric hospitalizations in the metropolitan regions of the capitals of Rio de Janeiro (RJ) and SÃ£o Paulo (SP) states. This is an ecological time-series study with population consisting of dwellers of metropolitan areas of the municipalities of RJ and SP hospitalized in the Unified Health System (SUS). Secondary data were collected from DATASUS and IBGE portal and indicators calculated (CAPS supply, PHC coverage, provision of psychiatric beds and psychiatric hospitalization rates). Indicators' time trends and the association between CAPS and PHC coverage and hospitalization rates were calculated. Reduced psychiatric hospitalizations rates and psychiatric beds and increased CAPS and PHC coverage were observed in the two location under study, with inverse and statistically significant association. Results confirmed the hypothesis of association between increasing CAPS and PHC supply with decreased psychiatric hospitalization rates, in the study's period and regions. This finding reinforces the importance of continuous and improved health and psychiatric reform-related policies.
