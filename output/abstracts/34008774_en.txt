Adapt and validate the content and appearance of the Expanded Protocol of Orofacial Myofunctional Evaluation with Scores (OMES-E) for nursing infants aged 6 to 24 months. This is a validation study. The parameters were based on the literature on orofacial motor development, the authors' experience, and on a committee of ten members. Data analysis was performed using descriptive statistics, content validity index, and agreement among experts. The protocol was organized into functional blocks after maintenance, exclusion, modification, and addition of items, and was adapted according to the age group. A high level of agreement between experts was obtained for 90% of the items. The final version of the protocol includes new items such as history of feeding, orofacial parafunctional habits, facial mobility, dentition, oral breathing mode, swallowing of pasty food, and details specific for the age group. An operational manual and a table for recording the scores were also included. The OMES-E Infants protocol was validated for its content and appearance, and may contribute to orofacial myofunctional diagnosis in the 6 to 24-month age group.
