Musculoskeletal injuries such as dislocation of the shoulder and hip joints and fractures of the femoral neck are known complications of seizures. Bilateral central subluxation of the hip joint with associated bilateral quadrilateral plate fracture is a rare entity and is prone to delayed diagnosis, even more so in patients who experience post-seizure disorientation. The authors report the case of a 74-year-old male patient with bilateral central subluxation of the hip joint with associated bilateral quadrilateral plate fracture due to seizure activity. Bilateral open reconstruction and fixation of the quadrilateral plate with a 3.5-mm pre-bent reconstruction plate reinforced with 3.5-mm pelvic brim reconstruction plate was performed. In conclusion, this case is an example of rare bilateral quadrilateral plate fracture caused due to seizure activity, a fracture for which a high level of suspicion should be kept in mind while evaluating the patient post-seizure episode.
