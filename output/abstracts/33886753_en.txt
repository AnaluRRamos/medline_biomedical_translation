The scope of this study was to describe the consumption of fruit in Brazil and its association with the intake of ultra-processed (UP) foods in a representative sample of 32,900 individuals from the 2008-2009 Household Budget Survey. The association between calory contribution of fruit to the diet and quintiles of UP food intake was analyzed using linear regression. Fruit accounted for just over 5% of the calories, about half of which (2.4%) was in the form of juice. Men revealed lower consumption than women, and consumption increased with increasing age, income, and schooling. An inverse association between consumption of whole fruits and UP food was observed. Among the individuals who reported consuming fruit (68%), there was little diversity (mean: 1.16 types/day). The fruit most consumed included orange, banana, and apple. Whole fruit was consumed mainly at lunchtime and as snacks. The consumption was inversely associated with UP food intake at lunch, afternoon snack, and dinner. Juices were consumed mainly at lunchtime and did not vary with UP food intake. Higher fruit consumption outside the home occurred in all quintiles of UP food intake. Low fruit intake in Brazil and the association with UP consumption highlight the need for initiatives to promote healthy eating.
