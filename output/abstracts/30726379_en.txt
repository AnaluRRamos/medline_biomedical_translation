The scope of this study was to investigate the factorial structure of the questionnaire for the inclusion of vegetable oil in natura in the diet of children. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 220 mothers using the Likert Scale questionnaire. Thirteen Child Nutrition experts/judges semantically evaluated the items and the Generalizability Coefficient (GC) assessed the errors according to a one-off, two-facet random model (item/judge). The Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) indicated dimensionality of the tools applied: Doornik-Hansen Test; Main Factor Analysis; Kaiser Guttman criterion; Promax rotation; Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test (KMO); convergent and discriminant validities, Cronbach's Alpha; Composite Reliability. The GC = 0.8407 was considered satisfactory. The Doornik-Hansen test (chi2 (28) = 198.053, prob>chi2 = 0.0000) confirmed the multivariate normality of data. The Kaiser Guttman criterion explained 76.32% of the latent construct. The correlation between factors 1 and 2 (-0.4042) suggests the two-dimensional nature of the instrument. The KMO (0.8440) indicated the adequacy of the data to perform EFA. Cronbach's alpha showed values around 0.70, considered acceptable. The two-dimensionality of the questionnaire was verified to assess the inclusion of in natura vegetable oils in the diet of children.
