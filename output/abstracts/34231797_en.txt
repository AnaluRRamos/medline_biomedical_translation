The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) may lead to severe disease that can cause death. COVID-19 is known to affect the cardiovascular system. Early detection of the progression to the severe disease stage that affects the cardiovascular system may play a critical role in the treatment of COVID-19. To explore the possible relationship between the COVID-19 pneumonia and right ventricular strain findings on electrocardiography (ECG). We conducted a retrospective study of 141 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Spearmanâ€™s correlation and logistic regression analyses were applied to assess relationships between ECG manifestations of right ventricular strain and levels of biomarkers and other laboratory and chest imaging findings. The significance level was considered as < 0.05. The ECG signs of right ventricular stress were significantly more frequent and the levels of fibrinogen, CRP, and ferritin were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients with elevated levels of hs-cTnI, procalcitonin and D-dimer. The univariate analysis showed there are significant relations between the presence of bilateral pneumonia, most of the ECG signs of right ventricular strain and cardiac injury and inflammatory and thrombotic biomarkers. The multivariate analysis revealed that ST-segment elevation in V<sub>1</sub>and the S<sub>1</sub>Q<sub>3</sub>T<sub>3</sub>pattern are independent predictors of cardiac damage (odds ratio=0.23; 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.90; p=0.035) and elevated procalcitonin levels (odds ratio=0.19; 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.62; p=0.006), respectively. The findings of the present study suggest that right heart damage is prevalent in COVID-19. In addition, our study shows the clinical value of ECG in evaluating and monitoring the patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.
