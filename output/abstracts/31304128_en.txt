To assess if the initial results of viscosupplementation are improved by the addition of corticosteroid. We evaluated 104 patients receiving usual care for knee osteoarthritis at the Universidade de São Paulo Medical Center. Patients were randomized to receive either a single intra-articular injection of 6 mL of Hylan GF-20 (Group 1) or a single intra-articular injection of 6 mL of Hylan GF-20 plus 1 mL (20 mg) of Triamcinolone Hexacetonide (Group 2). VAS, WOMAC and Lequesne questionnaires were applied at weeks zero (prior the injection), and after one, four, and 12 weeks. The baseline measurements of the two groups with 52 patients each were not statistically different. At week one, WOMAC and VAS showed significantly better results for Group 2 compared to Group 1 (p < 0,05). At week four the scores did not show a statistically significant differences. The groups showed similar results at week 12. The addition of Triamcinolone Hexacetonide improves the short term symptom/functional scores of viscosupplementation.
