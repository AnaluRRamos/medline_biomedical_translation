To validate the Pediatric Vocal Symptoms Questionnaire (PVSQ) for Brazilian Portuguese. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee (758,309). A total of 716 individuals participated in this research, of which 367 were children and adolescents, with and without vocal alteration, aged 6-18 years, and 349 were parents/guardians, who responded to the final version of the instrument. Among the interviewed of this version, 272 participated in the test-retest, and 32, of the sensitivity. Children and adolescents aged 6-18 years responded to the self-evaluation version of the PVSQ, and their parents/guardians to its parental version. The PVSQ showed acceptable reliability and reproducibility for the Brazilian population and sensitivity to vocal treatment. The PVSQ was validated for Brazilian Portuguese, being a good instrument of vocal self-evaluation, both in the parental version and in the self-evaluation version.
