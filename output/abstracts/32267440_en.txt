In Primary Health Care (PHC), access, and integrality are strongly influenced by the coordination of care, which in turn receives a positive impact from the articulation of telehealth actions for teleregulation of care. We created a teleregulation method (RegulaSUS Project) based on specific protocols firmly grounded in scientific evidence. From data of the regulatory system and Telessa√∫deRS, we explored the effects of RegulaSUS on PHC and access to specialized care. This method set comprehensive protocols, with a significant mean reduction of 30% in the specialized visits queue over 360 days. It reduced waiting time for medical clinical visits (median of 66 days) but not for surgical appointments. Waiting times for queued cases varied inversely, increasing for clinical and declining for surgical specialties. The use of teleconsultations unrelated to regulation increased with the exposure of professionals to RegulaSUS. The intervention evidence potentiality in the integration of health systems, mainly among low- and middle-income countries, and makes telehealth act as a meta-service, building efficient, qualified, and equitable networks.
