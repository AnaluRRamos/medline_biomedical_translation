Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is a widely used surgical technique in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) that can lead to significant reductions in motor symptoms. To determine, from publications, the most commonly used instruments for cognitive evaluation of individuals with PD undergoing DBS. A systematic review of the databases: PubMed, Medline, EBECS, Scielo and LILACS was conducted, using the descriptors 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Verbal Fluency', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Executive Function', 'Cognition' and 'Cognitive Assessment' in combination. The Verbal Fluency test was found to be the most used instrument for this investigation in the studies, followed by the Boston Naming Test. References to the Stroop Test, Trail Making Test, and Rey's Auditory Verbal Learning Test were also found. The validation of instruments for this population is needed as is the use of batteries offering greater specificity and sensitivity for the detection of cognitive impairment.
