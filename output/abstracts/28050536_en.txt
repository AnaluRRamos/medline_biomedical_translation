To analyze and evaluate functional and clinical results in patients with congenital clubfoot treated with Ponseti's technique. This study evaluated 31 patients diagnosed with 51 congenital clubfeet, treated between April 2006 and September 2011 with Ponseti's technique. The patients who did not achieve an equinus correction with manipulation were treated with Achilles tenotomy. An anterior tibial tendon transfer was performed in patients who maintained residual adduction. All plasters were made by fellows and supervised by Ankle and Foot Chiefs. The technique was performed without the need for physical therapists, orthotics, and plaster technicians. Patients were submitted to pre- and post-treatment examination and evaluated under Pirani's classification. Male patients had an increased incidence and the right side was more affected, while bilateral involvement was observed in 64.5% of the cases. The mean number of cast changes was 5.8, and Achilles tenotomy was necessary in 26 patients. There were significant deformity improvements in 46 of the 51 treated feet (90.2%); Pirani's mean score improved from 5.5 to 3.6 after treatment. The Ponseti method was effective in both functional and clinical evaluation of patients, with significant statistical relevance (<i>p</i> = 0.0001), with a success rate of 90.2% and mean improvement in the Pirani's index of 65.5%.
