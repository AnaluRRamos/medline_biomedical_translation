To evaluate the complication rate of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in octogenarian patients and identify predictive factors. The study comprised 70 octogenarians and 70 non-octogenarian patients as control group, all submitted to TKA. We analyzed the medical records of these patients, seeking for complications during the first postoperative year. Regarding the risk factors, we evaluated: age, sex, race, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, body mass index, smoking, hypertension and diabetes mellitus. In the control group, the incidence of complications was 7.1%. Whereas in the octogenarian group it was significantly higher, reaching 34.3% (OR 6.8; 95% CI 2.4-19.1). We found no association to sex, skin color, and comorbidities. Age is an independent risk factor for postoperative complications. Our data may help patients to acknowledge the risks of undergoing primary TKA and physicians to assess and adjust perioperative risk. The incidence of postoperative complications is significantly higher in octogenarians. <b>Level of Evidence III, Case-control study.</b>
