to characterize the profile of potential and effective organ donors, and to identify the factors related to non-donation. the data was collected from the Organization of Organ Donation forms during the period of January 2013 to April 2018. The statistical analysis was done by the Biostatistic Service of the School of Medical Sciences of UNICAMP. the study analyzed 1,772 potential donors; the male gender was predominant (57.39%). Vascular injuries (n=996) were the main cause of brain death. The family refusal (42.8%) was the leading cause of non-donation of organs. There was statistical difference between donors and non-donors in regard to the mean age and mean systolic blood pressure. There was also a relationship between the donation of organs and the absence of diabetes and smoking. the majority of effective organ donors were young males. The main causes of brain death (BD) and family refusal of organ donation were cerebrovascular disorder and no desire to donate organs after death, respectively. Alcoholics and males were more frequently found in traumatic causes of BD. Therefore, initiatives for population awareness and discussion among the families regarding organ donation can lead to increase the number of effective organ donors.
