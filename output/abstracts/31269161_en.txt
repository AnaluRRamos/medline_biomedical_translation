This article emphasizes PHC as a fundamental strategy for the sustainability of the SUS, based on its impact on health indicators. The attributes and requirements for Robust PHC are based on statements from researchers, policy makers and institutions, including the PAHO/WHO Representation in Brazil. The model proposed is the result of discussions with workers, researchers and health managers in Brazil, endorsing the commitments outlined in the Alma Ata Declaration. The article details the methodology of Health Innovation Laboratories used by PAHO/WHO in Brazil to systematize knowledge generated by innovative health experiences, including the Healthy Brasilia Project, an ongoing activity run by the Health Department of the Federal District (DF) of Brasilia, which has made important changes in the healthcare model, with emphasis on the expansion of Family Health Strategy coverage. This article analyzes the results of the Innovation Laboratories in Robust PHC in the FD that will be consolidated in a Case Study. The initiative aims to raise awareness amongst managers and health workers about innovation in health processes and policies that are essential for the sustainability of theSUS, focusing on the exchange of knowledge between peers about relevant initiatives in PHCin Brazil.
