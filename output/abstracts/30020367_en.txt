In this paper an attempt was made to analyze some of the main indicators of the evolution of the welfare state in OECD countries between 1980 and 2016. In particular, an assessment was made to evaluate if the so-called Great Recession starting in 2008 led to a contraction of the social state. The analysis focused on three dimensions: social expenditure, funding, and effectiveness. The conclusion drawn was that the twenty-first century has been a period of expansion, both in terms of social expenditure and the catch-up of the latecomers. In particular, all traditional areas of social policy have expanded in tandem with a slight increase in 'active' social policies. The rise in social expenditure has been financed by increasing taxation not thoroughly alien to progressivity principles. Overall, it has been translated into an increased effort for redistribution. However, inequality and poverty are advancing at a higher rate.
