To identify the most frequent type of urinary incontinence in women assisted in two outpatient clinics of urogynecology, and to compare general and specific quality of life among the different types of incontinence measured through validated questionnaires. Cross-sectional study conducted at the urogynecology outpatient clinic. The following questionnaires were used for quality of life assessment: Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), International Consultation Incontinence Questionnaire Short-Form (ICIQ-SF), King's Health Questionnaire (KHQ), and Pelvic Organ Prolapse Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire (PISQ-12). The study included 556 women. Mixed Urinary Incontinence was the most frequent type (n=348/62.6%), followed by Stress Urinary Incontinence (n=173/31.1%) and Urge Urinary Incontinence (n=35/6.3%). Women with mixed urinary incontinence had greater impact on the general (SF-36) and specific quality of life (KHQ and ICIQ-SF) compared to the others (p<0.05). In the evaluation of sexual function (PISQ-12), there was no difference between groups (p=0.28). All types of urinary incontinence interfere both in the general and specific quality of life, but women with mixed urinary incontinence are the most affected.
