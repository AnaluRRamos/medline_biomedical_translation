The objective of this article is to examine factors associated with preventive health services search among Brazilian adults. Sample included adults participants from the National Health Survey (2013), that had reported any health service search in prior 15 days, categorized into 'treatment/diagnosis' or 'preventive' service. Exploratory variables included sex, age, race, marital status, education, household situation, private health plan enrolment and time of FHS enrolment. Associations were verified by prevalence ratios (PR), estimated using robust Poisson regression, considering complexity of sampling parameters. Final sample included 32,377 individuals, 12,94% have searched 'preventive' services. Preventive search was more often among women and less often among the older adults, those not living with partner, with less education. Having private health plan was associated with less preventive services search. FHS enrolment were not associated with preventive search. By conclusion, although some efforts and the importance of preventive actions, most of individuals search for treatment services.
