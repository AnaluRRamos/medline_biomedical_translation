Malocclusion is public health problem because of its high prevalence, treatment possibility, and impact on the individual's quality of life. This article aims to determining the prevalence of malocclusion in adolescents and to test its association with social vulnerability. A representative transversal study was performed with 1612 adolescents aged between 11 and 14 years old who came from public and private schools in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. The adolescents were examined by three calibrated examiners for diagnosis of malocclusion, using the Dental Aesthetic Index. The Social Vulnerability Index from Belo Horizonte was used to determine the degree of social vulnerability from adolescents. The data were analyzed using Poisson regression with robust variance (p<0,05). Most adolescents presented absence/minor malocclusion (68.7%). Dental crowding was diagnosed in 51.9% from the sample, diastema in 23.7%, anterior open bite in 7.6 %. Malocclusion was associated with social vulnerability (PR=1.25;95% CI=1.01-1.55). Dental crowding was the most prevalent type of malocclusion. The more socially vulnerable adolescents had worse indicators of malocclusion.
