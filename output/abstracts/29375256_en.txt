To identify the prevalence of osteoporosis and hypovitaminosis D among patients at the Siriraj Metabolic Bone Disease (MBD) Clinic, and to compare initial vitamin D levels in patients with and without a history of fragility fractures. Medical records of patients who attended our MBD clinic between 2012 and 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Patient baseline demographic, clinical, bone mineral density (BMD), and laboratory data were collected and analyzed. Osteoporosis was diagnosed when patients had a BMD T-score <-2.5 or presented with fragility fractures. There were 761 patients included in this study. Of these, 627 patients (82.4%) were diagnosed with osteoporosis and 508 patients (66.8%) had fragility fractures. Baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels were available in 685 patients. Of these, 391 patients (57.1%) were diagnosed with hypovitaminosis D. When evaluated only in patients with fragility fractures, the average initial 25(OH)D level was 28.2Â±11.6 ng/mL, and the prevalence of hypovitaminosis D was 57.6%. A high prevalence of osteoporosis and hypovitaminosis D was found among patients at our clinic; two-thirds of patients had a history of fragility fractures, and no difference in initial 25(OH)D levels was seen between patients with and without fragility fractures. <b>Level of</b><b>Evidence III, Retrospective Study</b><b><i>.</i></b>
