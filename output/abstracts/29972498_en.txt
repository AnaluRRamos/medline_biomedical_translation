Since its creation in 1994, the Family Health Program has become the main strategy for changing care models and increasing access to the first contact service of the Unified Health System (SUS). A little more than ten years later, in 2006 the program was transformed into the Family Health Strategy (FHS) within the National Policy on Primary Care (PNAB). This article evaluates the effects of the implementation of the FHS over the last two decades in Brazil, demonstrating the access provided and the trends in ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSC). This is an ecological, time series study with secondary data referring to the number of family health teams that were established and the number of hospital admissions due to ACSC in the SUS from 2001-2016. The results show a 45% reduction of the standardized ACSC rates per 10,000 inhabitants, from 120 to 66 in the period 2001-2016. Although it was not possible to isolate the specific effects of primary care, it is quite plausible that this reduction in ACSC rates is linked to the progress of FHS coverage in Brazil, especially in terms of improved follow-up of chronic conditions, improved diagnosis and easier access to medicines.
