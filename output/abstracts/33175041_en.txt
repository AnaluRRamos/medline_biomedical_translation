Information Technology (IT) has become fundamental in the provision of healthcare services, encompassing the entire gamut of aspects involved in the area. For this reason, IT can make a significant contribution to the performance of health organizations. There is a knowledge gap about how to introduce and implement improvements in these technologies, one of the reasons cited being the lack of studies on the topic of Evaluation of the Performance of Information Technology in health. The objective of this work is to contribute to the dissemination of knowledge on the subject, by conducting a systematic review using Proknow-C (Knowledge Development Process-Constructivist). By means of the analysis of production metrics, it was seen how the studies comprised in the Bibliographical Portfolio of research represent the area of knowledge investigated. Based on a systematic analysis of the content of these publications, it was possible to ascertain the knowledge gaps still existing in the area. As a limitation of the study, the constructivist nature of Proknow-C is the main issue and, in the suggestions for future research, it is recommended that, based on the analysis performed, the knowledge gaps identified be filled.
