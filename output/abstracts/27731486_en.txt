This study evaluated the masking ability of two opaques applied in different thicknesses. Eighty NiCr metal discs 16 mm in diameter and 1.0 mm thick were prepared. The disks were divided into 8 groups (n = 10). Ceramic opaque in paste (groups 1 to 4) or powder (groups 5 to 8) presentations were applied. They were machined with aluminum oxide burs to the following thicknesses: G1 and G5 = 0.10 mm; G2 and G6 = 0.15 mm; G3 and G7 = 0.20 mm and G4 and G8 = 0.30 mm. Dentin ceramic 0.7 mm thick was applied over these discs, sintered and glazed according manufacturer's instructions. Color was assessed with a Minolta CR10 spectrocolorimeter on the CIELab scale. Powder opaque had higher values on (L) and (ΔE) variables, and lower values on (a) and (b) variables compared to paste opaque. For opaque thickness, 0.10 mm had higher ΔE than all other thicknesses. L values were higher for 0.20 mm and 0.30 mm. Lowest and highest a* values were observed for 0.10 mm and 0.30 mm, respectively. No difference was observed for b* values. There were differences between paste and powder opaque types; 0.10 mm thickness behaves differently from the other thicknesses, with higher ΔE, while 0.15 mm does not differ statistically from thicker layers.
