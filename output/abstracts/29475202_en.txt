Melanomas of the female genital tract may occur in the vulva, the vagina, the ovary or the cervix. Pregnancy has been considered an aggravating factor in the evolution and prognosis of melanoma. A 35-year-old female presented with vaginal bleeding 2 months after a term cesarean delivery. An endovaginal ultrasound revealed a lesion in the uterine cervix. The pathological report revealed a small round-cell neoplasm, and the immunohistochemistry confirmed the diagnosis of malignant melanoma. A positron emission tomography revealed an expansive hypermetabolic lesion centered on the cervix, and hypermetabolic lesions in the liver and right kidney. Non-surgical treatment was provided, with biochemotherapy followed by ipilimumab and nivolumab. The patient died one year later. Postpartum vaginal bleeding, even if late-onset, should be investigated, as it may be a pregnancy-associated malignant melanoma, which has a poor prognosis.
