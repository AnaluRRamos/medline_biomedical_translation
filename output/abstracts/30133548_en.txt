Peritoneal carcinomatosis is the natural course of gastrointestinal, gynecologic, and primary peritoneal neoplasms. In recent years, our understanding of carcinomatosis has changed; it is no longer considered a disseminated condition, but rather a disease confined to the peritoneum. Thus, the combination of cytoreductive surgery and intraperitoneal chemotherapy has become the cornerstone of control of peritoneal metastases. Traditionally, intraperitoneal chemotherapy is delivered in the form of liquid solutions. However, a new mode of chemotherapy delivery to the abdominal cavity has arisen as an alternative to the conventional method. In Pressurized Intraperitoneal Aerosol Chemotherapy (PIPAC), the liquid solution is aerosolized into a spray, potentiating the distribution and penetration of the chemotherapeutic agent intraperitoneally. The present study aims to describe a novel form of this innovative surgical technique performed for the first time in Brazil, in a modification of the technique originally described for PIPAC: delivery through a single-port device.
