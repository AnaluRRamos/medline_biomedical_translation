The study aimed to describe cases and verify the frequency of anaphylaxis related to measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine produced by manufacturer A and to assess associated risk factors. This was a case-control study (1:4) in Santa Catarina State, Brazil, from July 14, 2014, to January 12, 2015, in children from one year to less than five years of age, vaccinated with MMR and reported with anaphylaxis, while the controls were without anaphylaxis. The measure of association was odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95%CI), using the chi-square and Fisher's exact tests. Anaphylaxis rates were calculated per doses distributed/administered. Fifteen cases and 60 controls were interviewed in 12 municipalities (counties). Anaphylaxis rates were 2.46 and 5.05 cases per 100,000 doses distributed and administered, respectively. Among the cases of anaphylaxis, eight (53.4%) were males, and among the controls, 36 (60%), with p = 0.64. The bivariate analysis of anaphylaxis and cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) showed OR = 51.62, with p = 0.00002 and 95%CI: 5.59-476.11. The variables family food allergy, breastfeeding, previous post-vaccine adverse event (PVAE), and simultaneous vaccination were not statistically significant (p = 0.48; p = 1.00; p = 0.49; p = 0.61). Anaphylaxis rates per doses distributed/administered exceeded 1/100,000 doses administered (expected rate). Anaphylaxis and CMPA showed a statistically significant association. No statistically significant associations were found with simultaneous vaccination, breastfeeding, family food allergy, or history of PVAE. the manufacturer should specify the product's components in the package insert, and children with a history of CMPA should not be vaccinated with this vaccine.
