To present our institution's experience with negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) as an adjuvant in wound healing of patients who have undergone revision total hip arthroplasty (THA) due to septic loosening in the presence of active fistula. We prospectively assessed patients presenting with THA infection, associated with the presence of fistula, treated with a PICO<sup>®</sup> device for NPWT, in combination with the standard treatment for prosthesis infection in our institution. Resolution of the infectious process and healing of the surgical wound without complications were considered an initial favorable outcome. We assessed 10 patients who used PICO<sup>®</sup> in our department. No complications were identified in association with the use of the NPWT device. The mean follow-up of the patients after use of the device was 12.7 months. Only one patient progressed with fistula reactivation and recurrence of infection. NPWT can be used in wound complications and infection following THA procedures safely and with promising results. Randomized prospective studies should be conducted to confirm its effectiveness. <b><i>Level of Evidence IV, Case Series.</i></b>
