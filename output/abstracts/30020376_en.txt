The article analyzes the implementation of integrated healthcare networks (RISS) and the strategies for care coordination by PHC in the Chilean public health system. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with policymakers from the public health system and academics, complemented by documentary analysis and bibliographic review. The country stands out for the institutionalization of care coordination instruments widely recognized, such as referral maps, demand manager physician, electronic records and, mainly, definition of protocols, under the strong leadership of the Ministry of Health and conduction by the Servicios de Salud managers, regional space for the construction of RISS. However, segmentation and fragmentation's degrees within the public subsystem were identified, with the maintenance of free-choice for specialized medical appointment and double waiting lists - one for procedures with explicit access guarantees and another for others cases. The Chilean experience demonstrates the need for a greater role for PHC so it will be able to take on the leadership of RISS. In the country, the network seems to orbit around large and powerful hospitals. Elements of a broader context of the health system also condition advances and impasses in the development of the analyzed strategies.
