To evaluate the frequency and reasons for missed nursing care and to verify whether the reasons for omission differ between professional categories. A quantitative and cross-sectional study carried out in the adult hospitalization units of a public hospital of a teaching institution. Data collection was performed from February to April 2017, through a personal and professional characterization form and the MISSCARE-BRASIL instrument. Fifty-eight (58) nursing professionals responsible for direct patient care participated in the study, of which 74.1% reported at least one missed nursing care activity during the work shift. The main reasons attributed to missed care situations were an inadequate amount of professionals, urgent situations with the patients during the work shift, and the non-availability of medicine, materials or equipment when necessary. Most care was 'always' or 'often' performed, and the reasons given for missed care are related to work resources, materials, and management style. Nurses differ from the technicians as to the reasons for not performing care.
