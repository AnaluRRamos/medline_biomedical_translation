To analyze the Interprofessional Collaborative Practice in Health from the perspective of professionals of the Primary Health Care teams. Participatory, qualitative, exploratory-descriptive study, performed in Basic Health Units of a municipality in the northwest of the Paran√°, with 88 professionals of thw Primary Health Care teams. The data collection took place from February to April 2017, through the 'Photovoice' data collection and analysis technique. Two categories of analysis emerged: A picture of the process of constructing concepts of the Collaborative Interprofessional Health Practice; A picture of the configurations of the Collaborative Interprofessional Health Practice in the work process among the Primary Health Care teams. It was pointed out that Collaborative Interprofessional Practice is a new term and little explored in the Primary Health Care scenario, but the reflections about the photos allowed the assimilation, the thematic approximation and the collective construction of knowledge validated by the practice.
