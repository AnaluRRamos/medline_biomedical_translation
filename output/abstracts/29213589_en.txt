Reaching a diagnosis may be difficult in the initial stages of dementia, especially in low educated individuals, when informant reports may be useful. To compare the sensitivity and specificity of the IQCODE against cognitive tests applied in clinical practice and to evaluate the possible cut-off points in Brazil. Individuals without dementia (CDR=0; N=5), with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) (CDR=0.5; N=15) and demented (CDRâ‰¥1; N=29) were evaluated using the Short IQCODE, a 16-item questionnaire applied to an informant, and on standard cognitive and functional scales. Diagnosis was reached by a consensus team with expertise in dementia, according to DSM-IV criteria, which was blind to the IQCODE results. IQCODE scores were positively correlated to the CDR (r=0.65, p<0.001) and negatively correlated with years of schooling (r= -0.33, p=0.021). IQCODE scores were positively correlated with CDR controlled by age and education (r=0.61, p<0.001). Linear regression showed that age was associated with the IQCODE (p=0.016) whereas education was not associated (p=0.078). IQCODE means according to the CDR classification were: CDR 0-3.37; CDR 0.5-3.75; CDR 1-4.32; CDR 2-4.61; CDR 3-5.00. The area under the ROC curve for dementia vs. controls was 0.869 (p<0.001), MCI vs. controls, 0.821 (p<0.001); and according to the groups classified by the CDR was: CDR 0.5 vs. CDR 1=0.649 (p=0.089), CDR 1 vs. CDR 2=0.779 (p=0.009), and CDR 2 vs. CDR 3=0.979 (p=0.023). These preliminary findings suggest that the short IQCODE can be used for the screening of MCI and dementia in Brazil.
