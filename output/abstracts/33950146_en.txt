To analyze if the use of synthesized voice anchor emissions in auditory-perceptual evaluation improves intra- and inter-rater agreement. This is a quantitative study. Thirty-two inexperienced evaluators were selected and performed two activities on a Programming Interface created by the authors: Active Calibrator Activity - auditory-perceptual evaluation of the roughness and breathiness parameters as 0-no deviation, 1-slight deviation, 2-moderate deviation, or 3-intense deviation of 25 voices with the support of anchored emissions of synthesized voices; and Inactive Calibrator Activity - auditory-perceptual evaluation of these same voices without the support of anchored vocal emissions. The voices were randomized for each activity, and the order of the activities was drawn randomly for each evaluator. The second activity was performed 15 days after the first. The Kappa coefficient was used to analyze intra- and inter-rater agreement, and the confidence interval (CI) was employed to compare concordances. Inter-rater agreement was higher for the intense degree of the breathiness parameter in the Active Calibrator Activity when compared to the Inactive Calibrator Activity, as well as the intra-rater agreement of the roughness parameter.333. Use of anchor emissions of synthesized voices directly in the evaluation improves intra- and inter-rater agreement in auditory-perceptual voice analysis.
