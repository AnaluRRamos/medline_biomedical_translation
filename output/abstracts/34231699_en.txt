This essay proposes a reflection on the social phenomenon that involves communication and construction of facts and narratives around science and the pandemic. We divide the text into four parts. It begins with a rapid overview on the disinformation over health in the context of the global digital integration: in the sequence, we argue about how this phenomenon is characteristic of the post-factual era in which we live, and then critically situate the denial of science in the pandemic context. Finally, the text discusses some propositions on the legal and institutional field commenting on recent advances in the United States and Europe. Our intention is to contribute to an initial reflection that can reposition science in health governance.
