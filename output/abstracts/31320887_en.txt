Anti-angiogenic regulators may have therapeutic implications for onset and progression of atherosclerosis. To demonstrate histological changes secondary to the use of bevacizumab in the aorta of pigs after interruption of flow in the vasa vasorum. Twelve pigs were divided into two groups. The intercostal arteries of the descending aorta were dissected and ligated and wrapped with a polyvinyl chloride membrane. The treatment group received an intravenous dose of bevacizumab. After 15 days, the animals were euthanized and the aorta removed. Histological slides were prepared for control and treatment groups and for non-manipulated areas and analyzed for degree of angiogenesis, injury, inflammation, and intimal thickening. Data were expressed as mean (SD) of scores and groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney test. The Poisson distribution was used to calculate 95% confidence intervals for mean scores, in order to determine effect statistics. Bevacizumab had adverse effects on all treated pigs. The analysis using a Scale of Magnitudes for Effect Statistics showed a trend toward a decrease in angiogenesis [0.58 (1.79/-0.63)] and injury [0.55 (1.76/-0.66)] and an increase in inflammation [0.67 (1.89/-0.55)] with threshold moderate effects. There was no difference in intimal thickening [0 (1.19/-1.19)]. The medication exhibited a trend toward reduced angiogenesis and injury, but no reduction in the inflammatory process or intimal thickening of the aortic wall. These findings are in disagreement with studies that correlate neovascularization with increased migration of inflammatory cells. Bevacizumab exhibited toxicity in the porcine model.
