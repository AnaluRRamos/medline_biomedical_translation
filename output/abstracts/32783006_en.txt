Demands as to productivity transform the work environment more and more stressful, and negatively impact on the motivation of workers and the performance of their work activities. Initiatives seek to consolidate advances in policies for comprehensive care for workers health, with actions to prevent injuries and promote health. Offering workers a Labor Gymnastics Program (PGL), which is not restricted to attention to musculoskeletal disorders, becomes a tool to encourage change in habits. To identify possible changes in workers habits after the implementation of a PGL. 41 workers in the administrative area and support from a teaching hospital in the municipality of Santa Cruz do Sul answered the questionnaire. The questionnaire includes variables on eating habits, displacement and physical activity, applied before and after intervention. The sessions were held during the workday, with frequency of three times a week, on alternate days, for 4 months, composed of physical activities and information on dietary reeducation, postural education, body awareness and the importance of regular physical activity. There is a predominance of females (61.0%), and age of 33.5Â±10.2 years. Changes in some habits were identified: increase in the number of workers who practice regular physical activity (p=0.01), increase in the duration and frequency of activity (p=0.04), and maintenance / reduction in the frequency of consumption of 'Embedded' (p=0.03). It was possible to identify positive changes in workers habits after the implementation of the PGL, suggesting that it is an important strategy in the field of health promotion.
