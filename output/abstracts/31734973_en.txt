True arterial aneurysms of the upper limb are rare and their treatment is intended to avoid complications as distal embolization, compression of surrounding neurovascular structures or rupture. The purpose of this study is to review the experience of a department in the surgical treatment of true arterial aneurysms of the upper limb. A retrospective study was performed between January 2007 and August 2017. From a total of eleven patients, nine were male and two were female. One of the patients had surgery twice because of two consecutive aneurysms of the upper limb. From a total of twelve cases, two were subclavian, one was axillary and nine were brachial aneurysms. Three of them had degenerative/idiopathic aetiology, one was associated to a cervical rib and seven occurred in the setting of arteriovenous fistula or kidney graft. Five patients had emergent surgery and the others had elective surgery. All of the patients were submitted to aneurysmectomy. As 30-day complications, there were two haematomas, one compartment syndrome and two early graft occlusions. Four patients needed re-intervention. During the follow-up period, all the grafts initially preserved were patent. There were no further known complications or amputation procedures. In this review most of the aneurysms were found in patients with haemodialysis vascular access or kidney grafts. Despite the need for early re-intervention in some cases, the surgical treatment of true arterial aneurysms of the upper limb is a low morbidity procedure.
