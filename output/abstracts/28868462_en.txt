Mucosal prolapse polyps (MPPs) are rare inflammatory lesions that are part of the mucosal prolapse syndrome. We present the case of a 40-year-old male with history of constipation referred to our institution with suspected rectal malignancy due to hematochezia and a palpable rectal mass. Colonoscopy revealed a 25Â mm wide lesion suggestive of subepithelial origin but with marked erythema and erosion in the mucosa. Crypt dilatation and distortion, mixed inflammatory infiltrate and fibrosis were apparent on histological evaluation after bite-on-bite biopsies. Due to the initial suspicion of malignancy, resection was decided after discussion with the patient. However, due to non-elevation partial resection was performed allowing the diagnosis of MPP. Hematochezia ceased after obstipation treatment and endoscopic follow-up showed maintenance of the lesion with the same characteristics except for reduced dimension. MPP may mimic neoplastic lesions and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of rectal masses. History, endoscopy and histological characteristics are all necessary and important in the diagnosis of MPP.
