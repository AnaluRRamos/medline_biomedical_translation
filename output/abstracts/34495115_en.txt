The Casa da CiÃªncia at the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro is a cultural center meant to stir curiosity by connecting science, art, and culture. Different languages are used in an entertaining and interactive manner to discuss and popularize scientific concepts. This bibliographical and exploratory article addresses the historical aspects around the creation of the institution, its function, and its funding. It also provides a brief history of contemporary scientific dissemination in Brazil. A reflection on cultural, artistic and scientific/cultural policy for the implementation of the university's integrated system for museums, collections, and university heritage is also included, and indicates the difficulties in the processes of institutionalizing these spaces.
