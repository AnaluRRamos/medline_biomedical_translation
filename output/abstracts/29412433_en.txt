To validate the content of an educational material aimed at mothers and caregivers on healthy feeding for children less than two years of age. Quantitative study for content validation of an educational material containing three educational modules and respective folders, elaborated on the basis of official references for healthy feeding for children under two years old and adapted to the Brazilian context. Content validation was made through consensus conference in two stages by seven experts. In the first stage, an individual and anonymous evaluation was made and the items analyzed by the seven experts averaged seven or more, with standard deviation below three. However, some items in the educational modules (operational and adherence) and Leaflet I (motivation and culture) reached cut-off values. The second stage involved a face-to-face meeting with five of the seven experts, expressing their opinions and seeking for a new consensus. The items whose results were close to the cut-off had an expressive increase in importance and consensus level after the meeting. The quantitative data obtained after the consensus meetings were superior to the predefined cut-offs, and the content of the proposed educational material was consensually validated by all participating experts. The consensus conference was an efficient methodological technique to build and validate educational instruments.
