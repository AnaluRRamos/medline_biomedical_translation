Vascular Dementia (VaD) and Vascular Cognitive Impairment (VCI) are increasingly common worldwide. Nevertheless, the clinical-neuropsychiatric profile of these patients at presentation is still poorly characterized in developing countries. We aimed to characterize the prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms, as well as the clinical and cognitive profile of patients with VaD and VCI in our tertiary University outpatient cognitive clinic. We reviewed data on 253 patients diagnosed with VaD or VCI at our center between January 1996 and December 2005, located in an industrial region of the state of Sao Paulo, southeast Brazil. We excluded 19 patients who did not complete the medical investigation or who did not meet the clinical or neuroimaging criteria for vascular dementia. We collected socio-demographic data, educational level, vascular risk factors, behavioral and neuropsychological symptoms and cognitive complaints at presentation. Two hundred and thirty-four cases were included in this analysis. The mean age was 67.77±10.35 years; 72% were males and 82% had less than four years of education (average 2.84±2.96 years). The initial Clinical Dementia Rating score was 2 & 3 in 68%. A total of 185 patients had neuropsychiatric symptoms distributed in main categories as follows: psychosis (52.6%), hallucinations (23.5%), psychomotor agitation (22.5%), depression (17.5%) and apathy (17.5%). Hypertension and previous stroke were the most prevalent risk factors. We found a high prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms. The clinical-neuropsychiatric profile of patients presenting to cognitive clinics in developing countries may differ greatly to that of more developed nations. These characteristics may have implications for public health strategies.
