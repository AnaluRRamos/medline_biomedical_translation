Analyze the clinical and sociodemographic data on acetabular fractures in a Brazilian quaternary care hospital and compare with data reported in the literature. A descriptive, analytical cross-sectional epidemiological study analyzing 87 patients with acetabular fractures at Hospital SÃ£o Paulo (UNIFESP/EPM) between 2005 and 2016. Demographic variables such as age, sex, occupation, educational level and color were investigated. Acetabular fractures were classified according to the AO/OTA group and Judet and Letournel classification. Therapeutic approach, hospital length of stay and waiting time for surgery as well as complications were analyzed. Associations were established among the various variables obtained. The mean age of patients with acetabulum fractures was 39.8 years (SD 13.1 years). There was a predominance of posterior wall (34.5%) and dual-column (14.9%) fractures. The average hospital length of stay was 14.4 days. More than 90% of patients underwent a surgical procedure. One-fourth of patients had complications, the main one being infection (12.6%). Unimodal age distribution was obtained with a predominance of white male economically active patients. There was a predominance of posterior wall fractures. More than 90% of patients underwent surgery before they had been in hospital for 14 days. A statistically significant association was found between complications and exceeded length of hospital stay. <b><i>Level of evidence II, Retrospective study.</i></b>
