Among 1,693 individuals aged 2 to 22 years, 6.1% tested positive for COVID-19 and, among these, 35.5% did not present any symptoms. Differences were identified between positive and negative cases regarding the number of symptoms (p-value=0.001).Coughing was reported by 40.4% of positive individuals. Only 14.3% sought health care, namely 29.8% among those who tested positive and 13.3% among those who tested negative (p-value=0.001).
