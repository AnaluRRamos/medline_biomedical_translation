The purpose of this article is to report the case of a 53-year-old black man, with no previous comorbidities, who presented 48 days after a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, complaining of an initially insidious epigastric pain that had progressed to severe pain radiating to the interscapular vertebral region, with hyporexia and episodes of projectile vomiting, with no nausea or fever. Laboratory tests revealed no signs of acute infection or pancreatic injury. Abdominal computed tomography showed dilated, fluid-filled small bowel loops with thickened walls. After clinical treatment, the patient developed persistent abdominal pain. An exploratory laparotomy was performed, finding two sites of small bowel stenosis, with no extrinsic cause, and signs of local ischemia and considerable distension of jejunal and ileal loops. After enterectomy and side-to-side enteroanastomosis, the patient recovered satisfactorily and was discharged with a prescription for oral anticoagulants for outpatient use.
