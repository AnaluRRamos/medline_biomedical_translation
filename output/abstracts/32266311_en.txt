Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare and difficult-to-diagnose disease that often associates with inflammatory bowel disease. We present a case of a 57-year-old female with ulcerative colitis receiving 5-ASA who presented with rapidly progressive ulcers in the right foot and on the inside of the thigh, extending from the left large vaginal lip to the perianal area, compatible with PG. She was initially treated with corticosteroids with no response. After multidisciplinary consultation, it was decided to initiate in-fliximab 5 mg/kg, and to perform ileostomy for fecal diversion and negative-pressure wound therapy. The patient presented with marked improvement of the lesions, being discharged after 2 months and demonstrating almost complete resolution of the lesions within 4 months. Due to the rarity of PG, there is no evidence of the optimal management. The role of surgery is controversial as PG lesions can demonstrate pathergy and theoretically could worsen with surgical intervention. In this case it was decided based on the extent of the lesions and the experience in other septic/ulcerative perianal conditions.
