To estimate prevalence and factors associated with hypertension in adults in Senador Canedo, Goiás, Brazil, in 2016. This was cross-sectional survey, with three-stage cluster sampling. A questionnaire was applied and weight, height, waist circumference, blood pressure and total cholesterol levels were measured. Poisson regression was used to estimate prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Hypertension prevalence was 23.6% (95%CI - 19.3;28.6) among the 709 participants. The associated factors were: sedentarism (PR=1.7 - 95%CI% 1.1;2.5); enlarged waist circumference (PR=5.9 - 95%CI 3.6;9.6); hypercholesterolemia (PR=2.6 - 95%CI 1.3;5.2); and age ≥60 years (PR=2.9 - 95%CI 1.3;6.2). Hypertension prevalence was lower than that described for Brazil as a whole in 2013. Physical inactivity, accumulated abdominal fat and age were factors associated with hypertension.
