To build, validate and test a high-fidelity clinical simulation scenario for sepsis management. Methodological study developed in three phases: construction of a simulation scenario using the framework Model of Nursing Training Simulation and protocols established by the Latin-American Sepsis Institute, content validation by nine judges, and scenario testing by two nurses from a hospital institution. Data analysis was carried out through Content Validity Index, with values > 0.90 among the judges being considered satisfactory. The simulation scenario was observed to be appropriate and obtained an overall value > 0.90. However, some adjustments to the scenario and the test were performed concerning textual clarity, functionality, and the protocol's pertinence, following the judges' suggestions. The validated simulation scenario is expected to be a facilitator instrument for educators and professionals in the permanent/continued education nuclei of teaching and health institutions.
