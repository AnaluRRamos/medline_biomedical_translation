The aim of the present study is to report an original, unusual, case of bilateral anatomical variation of the sciatic nerve, with low origin and high division. Anatomical dissection was performed on a 66 year-old female cadaver. The corpse was embalmed and conserved through our original embalming techniques. The particular anatomical variation was first detected during routine dissection classes for undergraduate students. The study was completed with contralateral dissection to unveil bilateral variation. In both hind limbs, the sciatic nerve had a low origin, deep below the mid-gluteal region, and suffered high division, near the lower margin of the gluteal region, after a short length of circa 8 cm, to divide into the common fibular and tibial nerves. We detect several cases of sciatic nerve high division, in the reports of the earliest anatomists, such as Leonardo da Vinci, Vesalius, Da Cortona, or Eustachius. Such ancestral interest for these anatomical variations demonstrates the importance of their knowledge for health professionals of different areas. The accurate study of sciatic nerve anatomical variations bears evident surgical, anaesthesiology and clinical applications. As more meticulous as our anatomical studies may get, one will never reach the state of perfection to consider such studies as definitive.
