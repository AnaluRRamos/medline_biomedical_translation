To test the use of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in stratifying suspicious breast lesions (BI-RADS 4), correlating them with histopathology. We also investigated the performance of DWI related to the main enhancement patterns (mass and non-mass) and tested its reproducibility. Seventy-six patients presented 92 lesions during the sampling period. Two independent examiners reviewed magnetic resonance imaging studies, described the lesions, and determined the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values. Differences among benign, indeterminate- to high-risk, and malignant findings, in terms of the ADCs, were assessed by analysis of variance. Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, we compared the performance of ADC values in masses and non-mass lesions, and tested the reproducibility of measurements by determining the coefficient of variation and smallest real difference. Among the 92 lesions evaluated, the histopathology showed that 37 were benign, 11 were indeterminate- to high-risk, and 44 were malignant. The mean ADC differed significantly among those histopathological groups, the value obtained for the malignant lesions (1.10 × 10<sup>-3</sup> mm<sup>2</sup>/s) being significantly lower than that obtained for the other groups (p < 0.001). ROC curves demonstrated that DWI performed better when applied to masses than when applied to non-mass lesions (area under the curve, 0.88 vs. 0.67). Reproducibility was good (coefficient of variation, 7.03%; and smallest real difference, ± 0.242 × 10<sup>-3</sup> mm<sup>2</sup>/s). DWI can differentiate between malignant and nonmalignant (benign or indeterminate- to high-risk) lesions, showing better performance for masses. Nevertheless, stratification based on histopathological criteria that are more refined has yet to be achieved.
