Although health is a recurrent topic in newspapers, some diseases are visibly excluded from this coverage, originating diseases neglected by the media. The goal of this study was to identify - based on the opinion of journalists, press officers, health managers, and government health advisors - these diseases along with strategies for dealing with media neglect. The qualitative study was based on 19 semi-structured interviews with key actors. Data was submited to thematic content analysis using Maxqda software. The neglected diseases include infectious and parasitic diseases, rare diseases, periodontal diseases, cancer, and work-related illnesses.
