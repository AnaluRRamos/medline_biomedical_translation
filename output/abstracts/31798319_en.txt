This anatomical study aimed to analyze the possibility of transferring the radial nerve branches destined to the brachioradialis (BR), extensor carpi radialis longus (ECRL), extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB), and supinator (SM) muscles to innervate the AIN. Ten limbs from five male cadavers were prepared by intra-arterial injection of a solution of 10% glycerol and formalin. The presence of only one branch to the BR muscle was noted in 7 limbs and two branches were noted in three limbs. In two members of a common trunk with branch to the ECRL. In eight cases, we identified one branch for the ERLC and two branches in two cases. We identified only one branch for the ECRB, while in six limbs, two branches were noted, penetrating the muscular body at two different points. We identified at least two branches innervating the supinator muscle. The AIN was detached from the median nerve distal to the intercondylar line of the humerus. In seven limbs, it originated from the nervous fascicles of the posterior region of the median nerve and from the posterolateral fascicles in three limbs. The flexor pollicis longus and flexor digitorum profundus muscles received more than one branch of the AIN in all limbs. The radial nerve branches for the ECRL, ECRB, and supinator muscles can be transferred directly to the AIN or to one of its branches after intraneural dissection, without tension even in elbow movements. <b><i>Level of Evidence IV; Case series.</i></b>
