to analyze lung cancer mortality trends in Brazil, 2000-2015. this was a time series study; lung cancer death records were corrected; linear autoregressive models were used to calculate regression coefficients (β1) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) in trend analysis according to sex, in the 30 and over age group, for 19 metropolitan areas (MAs) and the interior regions of 14 Brazilian states; positive β1 indicates upward trends while negative β1 indicates downward trends. increases were found in males from interior regions of North and Northeastern Brazilian states, especially in Rio Grande do Norte state (β1=1.03 - 95%CI0.47;1.58); downward trends were also found in males, notably in the Porto Alegre MA (β1=-2.55 - 95%CI-2.79;-2.31); the highest increase in females was found in the interior of Ceará state (β1=0.86 - 95%CI0.79;0.92). differentiated patterns according to location and sex were revealed; cancer control measures should be considered above all for women and the interior regions of Brazil.
