The objective of this article is to determine the relationship between frailty and socio-demographic/clinical characteristics in patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 107 participants. Descriptive, correlation and logistic regression analyses were performed, with the level of significance set to 5% (p < 0.05). The prevalence of frailty was 47.66%. Frailty was negatively correlated with cognition (r = -0.30; p = 0.002), functioning on instrumental activities of daily living (r = -0.41; p = 0.000) and hematocrit level (r = -0.19; p = 0.04). The proportion of frailty increased with the age of the participants (OR = 1.03; 95%CI: 1.004-1.069; p = 0.02). Individuals with chronic kidney disease on dialysis had high percentages of frailty, which was associated with an older age and correlated with cognition, functioning on instrumental activities of daily living and a lower hemotocrit level.
