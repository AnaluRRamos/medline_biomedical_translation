This article provides details and tips on the dry arthroscopic technique, based on our experience and its clinical applications. The technique was applied to 65 patients (33 men and 32 women) aged between 20 and 62 years (average of 35.4 years) for treating: synovial cyst resection, scapholunate ligament injury repair, ulnocarpal impact correction, triangular fibrocartilage injury repair, and assisted reduction of distal radius fractures. A minimally invasive intra-articular evaluation has been observed as a benefit, with low infection rate, small scars, and high rates of early recovery, without affecting intra-articular fluid use, reducing the risk of compartment syndrome and infiltrated soft tissues, in the case of need for associated open surgery. As for the difficulties, we report the surgeon's view, which is commonly prevented by optical blurring or debris that hit the lens, and the need for radiofrequency care, since the heat generated is dissipated with greater difficulty than in the classical technique. Dry arthroscopy emerges as an effective choice to treat wrist pathologies, however, deep knowledge and ease with the classical technique, as well as a learning curve, are key to obtain a good outcome. <b>Level of Evidence V, Expert Opinion.</b>
