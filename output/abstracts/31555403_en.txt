Depression is characterized by physical or psychological distress and in many cases can lead to suicide. to assess the prevalence of depression and its possible relationship with dietary total antioxidant capacity (DTAC) and nutritional parameters in climacteric women participating in an extension university program in a Southern Brazilian city. data were obtained through questionnaires and anthropometric measurements. Diet was assessed using a 24-hour dietary recall. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was used to assess the intensity of symptoms of depression. DTAC of the population ranged from 435.60 to 4502.62 mg VCE/day. Among the most consumed antioxidant food/beverages, coffee ranked highest. Polyphenols were found to be directly linked to the antioxidant capacity of fresh foods (r=0.905; p=0.0001). Prevalence of depression in the population was 44%, and depressed women had lower intake levels of polyphenols (p=0.022; Cohen's d=0.80), and vitamin B6 (p=0.038; Cohen's d=0.65), vitamin A (p=0.044; Cohen's d =0.63), and vitamin C (p=0.050; Cohen's d =0.61). There was a significant negative correlation between BDI scores and polyphenol intake (r=-0.700; p=0.002). these results may contribute to a better understanding of the recommended dietary antioxidant intake as an adjuvant for preventing depression in women.
