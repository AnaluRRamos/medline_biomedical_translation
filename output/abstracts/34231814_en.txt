We report a case of Influenza B infection and Kawasaki disease in an adolescent, diagnosed during the COVID-19 pandemic. An asthmatic female adolescent presented with fever and flu-like symptoms for 7 days and was admitted with acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. She progressed with hemodynamic instability responsive to vasoactive drugs. Antibiotic therapy and support measures were introduced, showing progressive hemodynamics and respiratory improvement, however with persistent fever and increased inflammatory markers. During the hospitalization, she developed bilateral non-purulent conjunctivitis, hand and feet desquamation, strawberry tongue, and cervical adenopathy, and was diagnosed with Kawasaki disease. She was prescribed intravenous immunoglobulin and, due to the refractory clinical conditions, corticosteroid therapy was added; 24 hours later, the patient was afebrile. No coronary changes were found. A full viral panel including COVID-19 C-reactive protein and serology could only isolate the Influenza B virus. During the hospitalization, she was diagnosed with pulmonary thromboembolism; coagulopathies were investigated, and she was diagnosed with heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation. There is a potential association between Kawasaki disease and infection with Influenza B or with other viruses such as coronavirus. Therefore, this association should be considered in pediatric patients, adolescents included, with prolonged febrile conditions.
