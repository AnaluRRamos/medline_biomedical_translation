Based on Brazil's commitment to the fulfillment of the Agenda 2030 and its 17 Sustainable Development goals (ODS), the State Secretariat for health of the Federal District, sought partnerships to address the ODS 3-Health and welfare 'securing healthy and promote welfare for all, at all ages'. Because it is an ODS that permeates all others, governmental actions directed to health and well-being are of extreme relevance to the success in the implementation of Agenda 2030. In this article we present the initiatives for the activation of social networks in the locality called the Estrutural city, in the Federal District, as a strategy for measuring health determinants, the implementation of a monitoring approach and cooperative evaluation of risk situations and social and environmental vulnerability of the territory, having the prospect of making it healthy and sustainable from the reference of the new local production process and the Agenda 2030 of the development goals sustainable.
