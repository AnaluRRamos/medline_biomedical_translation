To evaluate the satisfaction of users assisted by speech-language pathologists during their Multi-professional Residency in Family Health, considering the structural, organizational and relational categories. Qualitative assessment conducted with 30 Family Health Strategy (FHS) users. Data were analyzed using Bardin's content analysis. The organizational category presented aspects associated with the organization of speech-language pathology (SLP) services, describing the specific practice and role of speech-language therapists in the FHS, as well as referral and waiting time for care, speech-language therapy actions, clarification of problems, and promotion of self-care. The relational category showed the relationship between residents and users, with emphasis on humanized care and bonding. The structural category described the dimensioning of speech-language pathologists in the FHS and the aspects related to the resources available in the health unit. User satisfaction was associated with the rapid access to the service and the humanized care provided by the residents, promoting a welcoming service and bonding between residents and community. User dissatisfaction was associated with the reduced number of speech-language pathologists available at FHS.
