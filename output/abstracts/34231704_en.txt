Our aim was to explore the feeding practices of indigenous children younger than two years old, living in Cruzeiro do Sul and Mâncio Lima, in Acre, Brazil. A cross-sectional study was conducted with indigenous children of the Katukina (Cruzeiro do Sul), Nukini, Nawa and Poyanawa (Mâncio Lima) ethnicities in October 2013. We used a structured questionnaire on the food consumption of the day before the collection, based on the food indicators proposed by the Ministry of Health. A total of 94 children (50% Katukina, 27% Poyanawa, 13% Nukini, and 10% Nawa) were studied. Among children under 6 months of age, although the majority was breastfed, 42.1% drank water, 15.8%, savory food, and 11.1%, local cuisine. In the age groups of 6 to 12 months and 13 to 23 months, a high consumption of ultra-processed foods was identified (52.6% and 28.6% respectively), while the consumption of complementary food was insufficient (33% of fruits and 25% of savory food between 6 and 13 months, and 41.2% of fruits and 19.6% of savory food between 13 and 23 months). The feeding profile of these indigenous children was inadequate for their age, revealing a concerning situation for this population.
