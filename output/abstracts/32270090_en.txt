Sleep disorders are receiving increasing attention in the occupational medicine literature as a function of their substantial impact on the functional recovery of workers. To investigate the relationship of leisure-time and transportation physical activity with sleep duration among technical-administrative employees at a public university. The sample comprised 371 participants. Data collection was performed by means of a self-report questionnaire for sociodemographic, nutritional, behavioral, health and occupational variables. We performed crude and adjusted analysis of the association between physical activity level and outcomes. Leisure-time physical activity exhibited positive correlation with sleep time on weekdays (β=22.2; p=0.006) and weekends (β=31.3; p=0.007). Transportation physical activity exhibited negative correlation with sleep time on weekends (β=-44.5; p<0.001). Leisure-time physical activity was associated with longer sleep duration on weekdays and weekends. Differently, transportation physical activity was associated with shorter sleep time on weekends. More studies, especially intervention studies, are needed to achieve a better understanding of the relationship between physical activity domains and sleep duration among workers.
