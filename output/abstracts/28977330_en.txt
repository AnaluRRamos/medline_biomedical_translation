To analyze perinatal features of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Retrospective review of the medical records of 75 children with ASD, between January 2008 and January 2015. Inclusion criteria were diagnosis of ASD based on DSM-5 criteria, and the informed consent form signed by the person who is legally responsible. The exclusion criterion was missing on the medical record. The variables analyzed were maternal age, prematurity (gestational age under 37 weeks), low birth weight (<2,500 g), and perinatal asphyxia (5th minute Apgar score <7). Data were analyzed using the difference between proportions test, being significant p<0.05. Seventy-five patients were included. Maternal age ranged from 21.4 to 38.6 years (29.8±4.1 years). Premature birth occurred in 14 (18.7%) patients, perinatal asphyxia in 6 (8.0%), and low birth weight in 32 (42.6%) patients. The prevalence of prematurity, low birth weight, and perinatal asphyxia among the children in our study was higher than the general prevalence of these conditions among all live births in our country, region, and state, which are, respectively, 11.5, 2.3, and 8.5% in Brazil; 11.0, 2.2, and 8.5% in Southern Brazil; and 10.5, 2.0, and 8.4% in the state of Paraná. Our findings show a higher prevalence of prematurity, low birth weight, and perinatal asphyxia among children with ASD. Some limitations are the retrospective study design, and the small sample size. Large prospective studies are needed to clarify the possible association between perinatal complications and ASD.
