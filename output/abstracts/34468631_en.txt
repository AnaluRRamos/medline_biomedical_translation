To verify the association between restrictions to auditory participation and quality of life, self-perceived health, auditory factors and sociodemographic aspects of adults and elderlies assisted in an audiology service. The study included 152 participants; restrictions to auditory participation were assessed using the instruments Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults - HHIA and the Hearing Handicap Inventory for Elderly - HHIE. In order to assess the quality of life, participants answered the World Health Organization Quality of Life - abbreviated version (WHOQOL-bref). Sociodemographic characteristics were assessed using a questionnaire to characterize the participants; and by the Brazilian Criteria ABEP. The results of the hearing assessment were also collected. Descriptive, bivariate statistical analyzes (p ≤ 0.20) and multiple logistic regression (p ≤ 0.05) were performed. Regarding social class, individuals belonging to classes B1 and C2 had, respectively, 4.75 and 7.73 times greater chances of presenting restrictions to auditory participation compared to individuals of class D. Regarding hearing factors, disabling hearing loss increased by 3.4 times the chance of presenting perception of restriction to auditory participation. In the environmental domain of the WHOQOL-bref instrument, each unit increased in the score was associated with a decrease of 0.96 times in the chance of perceived restriction in auditory participation. We found that the use of the amplifying hearing aid by itself, despite its benefits, did not eliminate the restrictions on auditory participation of most participants.
