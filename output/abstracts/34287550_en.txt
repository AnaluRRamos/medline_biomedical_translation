To evaluate the impact of catastrophic costs on unfavorable tuberculosis treatment outcomes. This was a prospective cohort study, conducted in five Brazilian state capitals (Manaus, Recife, Vit√≥ria, Campo Grande and Porto Alegre) from June 2016 to July 2018. Logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Of the 350 participants, 310 were included, of whom 30 presented unfavorable outcomes. Catastrophic cost (OR=2.53 -95% CI 1.13;5.67) and divorce (OR=5.29 -95% CI 1.39;20.05) increased the chances of unfavorable outcomes. Financial difficulties during tuberculosis treatment may impair its outcome. Catastrophic cost and divorce were determining factors for treatment outcomes.
