Olfactory perception, although restricted to just a few contexts in everyday life, is key in medicine. Several dementia conditions have been associated with early loss of olfactory discrimination. Despite the fact that several brain areas have been associated with olfaction in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the mechanisms by which emotional valence is conveyed to the brain are not fully understood. In this study, we compared cerebral activations by olfactory stimuli using different emotional valence stimuli on event-related fMRI. We used three standard olfactory odorants with different valence (positive, neutral and negative). Forty-three healthy subjects (22 males) were scanned on a 3.0T MR system. Olfactory stimulation was attained through a delivery system synchronized with image acquisition and subjectsÂ´ breathing instructions. fMRI data analysis was performed by the FSL package (Oxford University) including head movement correction, GLM modeling of the neurovascular (BOLD) response and group activation maps produced at p<0.05and corrected for multiple comparison. Increased cerebral responses within the anterior cingulate, amygdaloid nuclei, as well as the dorsolateral prefrontal, occipital and orbitofrontal cortices were observed in positive and negative valence conditions, while response to neutral valence arousal was less intense and not observed in the amygdaloid complex. The most significant statistical response aroused from the stimuli clusters was observed in the negative condition. The results of the present study support the hypothesis that neutral stimuli may be more sensitive to early losses in pathological conditions, particularly dementia.
