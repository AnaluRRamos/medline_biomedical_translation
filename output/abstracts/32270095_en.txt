Community health agents (CHAs) are a part of Family Health Strategy multidisciplinary teams, and their function is to develop individual and collective health promotion, recovery and preventive actions, including household visits. Their work exposes CHAs to hazards in the work environment, therefore, using personal protective equipment (PPE) is essential. To draw the sociodemographic and occupational profile of CHAs and investigate associations with use of PPE. Cross-sectional quantitative study performed with 137 CHAs in a coastal municipality in the north of the state of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. We applied a questionnaire for sociodemographic and occupational data. The data were subjected to descriptive and inferential analysis, with significance level of 5%. 94.16% of the participants were female, and their average age 34.80 years old. Their average time in the job was 3.18 years. The means of transport most often used to commute was bicycles. 94.16% of the participants reported daily use of some type of PPE, which included: sunscreen (88.32%), closed footwear (53.28%), hats (8.0%), sunglasses (6.57%) and raincoats (3.65%). We found significant association between use of PPE and longer time in the job, and between wearing closed footwear and older age and longer time in the job. The results point to the need of interventions to promote use of PPE.
