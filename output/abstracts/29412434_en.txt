To verify whether breastfeeding is associated with lower prevalence of consumption of sweetened beverages or foods in infants. This is a cross-sectional study with data collected from the Survey on Prevalence of Breastfeeding conducted in Brazilian municipalities in 2008. A representative sample of 14,326 infants aged 6 to 11.9 months of age, residents of 75 municipalities in the State of SÃ£o Paulo, Southeastern Brazil, was studied. The influence of breastfeeding on the consumption of sweetened beverages or food products was analyzed by multilevel Poisson regression. Variables with p<0.20 in the crude analysis were included in the multilevel analysis. Most infants were on breastfeeding (56.1%). The prevalence of sweetened drinks or foods consumption was 53.3%. The consumption of sweetened products was shown to be less prevalent among breastfed infants after adjustment for confounding factors (PR 0.87; 95%CI 0.83-0.91). Breastfeeding was associated with lower consumption of sweetened beverages or foods. As an additional effect of actions aimed at promoting breastfeeding, a decrease in intake of sweetened products is expected among infants.
