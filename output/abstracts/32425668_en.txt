To evaluate the profile of blood loss and blood transfusions after the introduction of Tranexamic acid (TXA) in a tertiary university hospital in Brazil. 173 patients were retrospectively divided into two groups: the ones who received TXA and the control group. Hemoglobin levels (Hb), drain output, transfusion rates, and thromboembolic events were measured. Among the patients included in this study, 82 cases received TXA. Blood transfusion occurred in 3 cases of the TXA group (3.7%), and in 27 control group cases (29.7%; p < 0.001). The average Hb decrease was 2.7 g/dl (± 1.39) and the median drain output was 270 mL in the TXA group. In the control group, the values were 3.41 g/dl (± 1.34; p < 0.001) and 460 mL (p < 0.001), respectively. Thromboembolic events occurred in 2 TXA group cases (2.4%) and in 3 control group cases (3.3%; p > 0.999). TXA was effective in reducing blood transfusion rates, Hb decrease, and drain output on the 1st postoperative day without increasing thromboembolic events. <i>Level of evidence III, Retrospective comparative study.</i>
