Google algorithms record trends in interest on topics relevant to public health. WEB searches were analyzed (2014-2019) to identify patterns linked to prostate cancer. Relative Search Volumes (RSV) were analyzed by Google Trends on 'prostate cancer' (PC), 'prostate examination' (PE) and 'PSA'; 260-week time series; Brazil region; Health category; Trend lines (degree 2 polynomials) to identify patterns; Averages compared by ANOVA; Sudden increase in November searches; Searches on PC greatly surpass PE and PSA; Stable annual PC averages; Discreet reduction in PE; Marked increase in PSA. In campaign months: Discreet increase in PC; stability in PE; Marked increase in PSA. 'Blue November' campaigns encourage early identification of prostate cancer, although interest is seen to be focused on the disease per se with a lack of interest in diagnosis throughout the year. Differences in relation to 'Pink October' are discussed - tenuous relation to educational level on prevention habits and the influence of celebrities. The conclusion drawn is that RSV analysis might be useful in tracking trends in prostate cancer screening to provide input for campaign developers.
