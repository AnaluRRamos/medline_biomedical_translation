This study proposes to reflect on the links between knowledge production and its daily effects on the field of sexuality, based on intersexuality as a contemporary issue. Intersexuality is an interesting object of analysis for such reflection, since it allows exploring the interfaces between knowledge production on sexuality, power relations between professionals, intersex persons, and their families, use of embodiment technologies, conceptions of the normal and natural body, formation of subjectivities, and the shaping of a new social, political, and moral order heavily associated with subjects' biological constitution. The reflections proposed here originated from a qualitative study in a public healthcare institution serving as a reference for intersex persons in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, focusing especially on the discourses of physicians involved in the care for intersex individuals.
