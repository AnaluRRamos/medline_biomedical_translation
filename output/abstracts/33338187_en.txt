This article presents the meanings attributed to experiences with sexuality by rural youth. This qualitative study from a sociological perspective follows the analytical lines of structuration theory, highlighting language as a means of accessing the subjectivity of the interviewees. The research was conducted in Orob√≥, Pernambuco, Brazil and involved 27 students aged 15 to 29. We conclude that in terms of sexual orientation, the beliefs and values acquired in the rural community by these young people prevailed over knowledge they acquired in the academic universe during the trajectory of their lives.
