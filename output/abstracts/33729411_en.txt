The recommendations for diagnostic tests for investigating syphilis are part of the Clinical Protocol and Therapeutic Guidelines for Comprehensive Care for People with Sexually Transmitted Infections and the Technical Manual for Syphilis Diagnosis, published by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. These recommendations were developed based on scientific evidence and discussions with a panel of experts. Aiming to contribute to the efforts of health service managers and health professionals in qualifying health care, this article presents the use of direct tests to detect Treponema pallidum in lesions, as well as algorithms that combine treponemal and non-treponemal antibody tests to assist in the diagnosis of syphilis. The article also covers use of non-treponemal tests to investigate neurosyphilis and guidelines for interpreting non-treponemal antibody titers in monitoring treatment and diagnosis of congenital syphilis, as well as prospects for innovations in diagnosis. The important role of rapid immunochromatographic treponemal tests for public health and for addressing syphilis is also highlighted.
