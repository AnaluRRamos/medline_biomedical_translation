Estimate the acceptability and adoption by health care workers of clinical practice guidelines and treatment protocols for women with preeclampsia/eclampsia and identify the facilitating factors and barriers to their implementation. A qualitative study was conducted, using semi-structured interviews and focus groups in five maternity hospitals. Interviews were compiled for analysis, and barriers and facilitators were characterized. Seventy health professionals (52 female and 18 male) participated, representing different levels of the health system. The majority of workers and managers were aware of the existence and content of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for eclampsia/preeclampsia, especially the participants with more time in the health service. With respect to facilitating factors, both medical and nursing staff were positive about continued development and implementation of high-quality CPGs. There was consensus that limitations exist, especially with respect to a lack of the necessary medicines, supplies, and equipment to meet and implement the established recommendations. The results of the study show the need to strengthen strategies that help close the gap between research and public policy. Studies suggest that research should focus on users, policy-makers, and decision-makers in the health system. The actors in the Dominican health system recognize the GRADE methodology as an appropriate instrument for the development and implementation of CPGs. Implementation barriers require systemic and comprehensive approaches.
