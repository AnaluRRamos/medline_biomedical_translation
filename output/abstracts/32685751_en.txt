Occupational accidents are considered public health problems, where there are gaps regarding studies on this theme in the northern region of Brazil with focus on nursing professionals. To analyze the factors related to occupational accidents in nursing professionals occurred in a large public hospital in Bel√©m (PA) from January 2009 to December 2016. Analytical, retrospective and longitudinal study with a quantitative approach by means of documentary census with a sample of 211 Work Accident Registry. We applied the Variance Analysis (ANOVA) tests for repeated measurements, chi-square of independence and t student for independent samples. Female workers (72,04%), nursing technicians (88,15%) between the ages of 30 and 36 (34,13%), singles (45,18%) and public servants (95,74%) are most affected by occupational accidents, mainly typical accidents (91,94%). Sharps are the major causative agents (34,12%), morning (p=0,001) and afternoon (p=0,035) shifts have the highest mean number of accidents, and accidents occurred mostly in upper limbs (56,87%) and in the psychiatry sector (34,12%). The highest incidence rates of occupational accidents occurred in 2012 (49.5) and 2014 (60.2) per 1.000 professionals/year. As much as these results are similar to others evidenced and available in the literature, the study is particular because it is data from a public hospital in the northern region, an area that is not covered by studies of nature this.
