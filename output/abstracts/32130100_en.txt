In about 28% of patients, dyslipidemia has a secondary cause. Many times, the treatment of these causes can lead to the total correction of dyslipidemia. We describe the case of a 50-year-old female patient with class II obesity and primary biliary cirrhosis, evaluated for mixed dyslipidemia with poor control (statins and fibrates were being administered) as well as abnormal liver tests. The investigation carried out revealed primary auto-immune hypothyroidism. After normalisation of thyroid function by treatment with levothyroxine, as well as suspending the administration of statins and fibrates, there was an improvement in the lipid profile, although hypercholesterolemia continued. During this time, the patient was diagnosed with diabetes and she re-commenced statin therapy (atorvastatin 10 mg), which resulted in a normal lipid profile being achieved. In this case, the authors set out to highlight the importance of excluding secondary causes of dyslipidemia - including hypothyroidism, and then go on to discuss particular aspects of statin therapy for liver disease.
