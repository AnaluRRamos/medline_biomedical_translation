to analyze the occurrence of psychiatric diagnosis and the use of psychotropics medications in subjects with vestibular complaints and to relate the presence of these conditions to the results of vestibulometry. quantitative, observational, cross-sectional study with 131 patients, treated in a university hospital. They were submitted to anamnesis, visual inspection of the external ear canal, static and dynamic balance tests, Foam laser dynamic posturography and Computerized Vectoelectronystagmography. sample composed of 109 women and 22 men, with average age of 55 years and nine months. The most common type of dizziness was vertigo, with the presence of neurovegetative signals. A significant percentage of psychiatric complaint/diagnosis was observed, as well as the use of psychotropic medications, mainly serotonin uptake inhibitors, followed by benzodiazepines. There was a relation between the presence of psychiatric complaints with the female gender, alterations of the static balance and alterations in the Sensorial Organization Test positions III and VI. In the Vectoelectronystagmography, there was a relation between age and the presence of spontaneous nystagmus. There was a high occurrence of psychiatric complaint/diagnosis among patients with dizziness, with use of psychotropic medications substantially greater than the general population. The evaluation of postural balance revealed an association between anxiety/depression and alterations visual overload positions in the foam laser dynamic posturography. However, no relationship was found between these conditions and alterations in the Vectoelectronystagmography tests.
