The aim of this study was to estimate the association between life habits and adequate consumption of fruits and vegetables (F&V) after four years of follow-up among elderly of a cohort in Florianópolis, Santa Catarina. This is a longitudinal population-based study, the sample being composed of individuals 60 years of age or older living in the urban area of the city of Florianópolis-SC. The baseline study took place in 2009-2010 and the second wave in 2013-2014. Adequate consumption was assessed by considering the frequency of ingestion of F&V at least five times a day at least five times a week. Life habits (smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity and Internet use) and a biological variable (nutritional status) were associated. Multilevel logistic regression was used for the statistical analysis. There was a 5.23% increase in F&V consumption between evaluations. In the adjusted final models, internet use was associated with a greater chance of regular consumption of F&V (OR = 1.48, 95% CI: 1.09 - 2.01), while overweight was associated with a lower chance of outcome (OR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.61 - 0.95). In conclusion, using the internet has proven to contribute significantly to a more adequate diet in F&V, as well as being overweight has shown to be a risk factor.
