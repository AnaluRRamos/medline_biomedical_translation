Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the world with great impact on public health and leukemia is a hematological cancer directly related to different exposures at work. This study aimed to describe the occupational profile of individuals diagnosed with leukemia. This is a cross-sectional study of cases registered between 2007 and 2011 in the Integrador RHC database. Individuals from 26 Brazilian states, aged 20 years or older, were included. Of the 7,807 cases of leukemia, Minas Gerais recorded the highest occurrence (1,351). Only 52% of the cases had information on occupation. Occupations with the greatest number of cases of leukemia were agricultural, forestry and fishing workers; services, stores and markets vendors; and workers in the production of industrial goods and services. These occupations are exposed to substances considered by literature as carcinogenic agents to humans. There was a high underreporting of occupational data, compromising the quality of information and, therefore, the effectiveness of the Brazilian health surveillance system. The RHC also does not provide information about the agent used during the working day, the exposure time during working life and data from previous occupations.
