To evaluate the accuracy and the effect of drill guide template for pedicle screw placement in severe scoliosis. Eight patients with rigid scoliosis were enrolled, five males and three females, ranging from nine to 23 years old. A three-dimensional CT scan of the spine was performed and saved as a DICOM file type. The multi-level template was designed by Mimics software and manufactured according to the part of the most severe deformity. The drill template was placed on the corresponding vertebral surface. Pedicle screws were carefully inserted across the trajectory of the template. Postoperatively, the positions of the pedicle screws were evaluated by CT scan and graded for validation. No spinal cord injury or nerve damage occurred. All patients had satisfactory outcomes. The abnormalities and the measures observed during operation were the same as those found in the preoperative period. The position of the pedicle screws was accurate, according to the postoperative X-ray and CT scan. The rate of scoliosis correction was 60%. Compared with controls, surgery time, blood loss and radiation were significantly lower. With the application of multi-level template, the placement of pedicle screws shows high accuracy in scoliosis with shorter surgical time, less blood loss and less radiation exposure. <b><i>Level of Evidence III, Retrospective Comparative Study.</i></b>
