The purpose of this paper was to compare the tendency of bullying across Brazilian capitals, considering the editions of National Scholl Health Survey (PeNSE) 2009, 2012 and 2015, and to describe the prevalence of bullying by sex, age and administrative dependence of the school in the 2015 sample. The prevalence of bullying and its 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were assessed per State capital and for all capitals. 95%CI was used to check for differences in the period. In the last edition, two samples were analyzed: sample 1 represents the students of the 9th year of Elementary School and sample 2 holds students from 13 to 17 years of age, from the 6th to 9th grade of Elementary and High Schools. The report of suffering bullying by 9th graders in Brazilian capitals increased from 5.4% (95%CI 5.1 - 5.7), in 2009, to 7.2% (95%CI 6.6 - 7.8), in 2012, staying at 7.4% (95%CI 7.1 - 7.7) in 2015. Descriptive analysis for Brazil showed variation by age, as adolescents aged 13 years suffered more bullying than those aged 14, 15 and 16 years. Boys usually report more this problem than girls, as well as public school students, but with overlapping CI. The study pointed 37% increase in the prevalence of bullying between 2009 and 2015 in Brazilian capitals by. This study reiterates that Brazilian schools are still a space for violence reproduction, which makes it urgent to make progress in prevention and minimization of bullying at schools based on the concept of health promotion and integral care.
