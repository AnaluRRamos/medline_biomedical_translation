to describe the histological findings of the gallbladders of patients undergoing cholecystectomy and to evaluate the presence of factors associated with gallbladder incidental cancer. we conducted a descriptive, cross-sectional, observational study with 1,278 histopathological exams of gallbladders coming from cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis and of their reports, held from January 2008 to December 2017. the most common pathological finding was chronic cholecystitis, present in 1,251 patients (97.8%), followed by gallbladder cholesterolosis, in 131 (10.2%). Gallbladder cancer was identified in six patients, with a prevalence of 0.5% in this sample. There was a significant association between the presence of cancer and age ≥60 years and wall thickness ≥0.3cm. there was low prevalence of gallbladder cancer in this population, higher occurrence in the elderly and association of the tumor with gallbladder wall thickness.
