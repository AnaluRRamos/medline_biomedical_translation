The scope of this study is to describe the prevalence and the factors associated with common mental disorders in women aged 18 to 49, residents in the rural zone of the municipality of Rio Grande-RS. A cross-sectional study was carried out with data collection conducted in 2017. A systematic sampling process of the residences of the rural area of the municipality was utilized. The General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) was used to track common mental disorders. Crude and adjusted Poisson regression was used to estimate the prevalence ratios (PR) and respective 95% confidence intervals. The overall prevalence of Common Mental Disorders was 36.4%, being more common among women with lower levels of education, who had had an abortion and were smokers. In quantifying the occurrence and factors associated with common mental disorders in a population of women in a rural area, this study provides an original scientific contribution on the burden of this important outcome in a population that has not been studied in epidemiological surveys. The results can contribute to the health services by identifying the women most susceptible to this outcome, thus, improving the adequacy of the services offered to the health needs of rural residents.
