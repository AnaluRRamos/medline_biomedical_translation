The prevalence of obesity is increasing at an alarming rate in many countries. Unhealthy eating and sedentary lifestyle are the main risk factors for obesity. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of obesity and identify the associated factors in the Brazilian adult population on the basis of data collected in the 2013 National Health Survey. We analyzed the data from a sample of 59,402 adult subjects, excluding pregnant women. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated by means of weight and height measurements. Obesity was defined as BMI â‰¥30 kg/m2. Logistic regression models were used to identify the factors associated with obesity. The prevalence of obesity was 16.8% for men and 24.4% for women. Advanced age (over 50 years), low education level (no schooling or incomplete elementary school), African Brazilian and living with partner were risk factors for obesity. Leisure time physical activity and the habit of watching more than 4 hours of television per day showed significant effects for both sexes. Regarding the referred morbidity, in obese people, the chances of having a diagnosis of hypertension, diabetes, or some non-communicable chronic disease were higher. Obese men and women had significantly increased systolic blood pressure. Our findings emphasize the importance of public policies for the prevention of obesity and for the promotion of healthy habits in Brazilian society.
