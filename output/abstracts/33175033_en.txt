Sex workers become increasingly economically vulnerable due to the restrictive measures implemented to combat the coronavirus pandemic. In this respect, the scope of this study is to analyze the content of prostitution websites and advertisements regarding measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic. It involved a description of the visits and analysis of content of communications on websites that advertise commercial sex transactions. The percentage change in the number of visits for three periods from 02/2019 to 04/2020 was calculated. Subsequently, ads with the terms 'corona,' 'pandemic' and 'quarantine' on websites that offer search engines were extracted. The Bardin method was then used for content analysis. There was an increase in the number of visits to prostitution websites between 2019 and 2020, followed by a decrease with the advent of the coronavirus pandemic crisis. With regard to the protection measures during the pandemic, health recommendations and the incentive to engage in virtual sex are highlighted. Of the 1,991,014 advertisements, 0.51% mention the COVID-19 crisis regarding noncompliance with social distancing, protection measures and the offer of online sex.
