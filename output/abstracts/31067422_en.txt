The present study aims to culturally adapt and explore the psychometric properties of Portuguese version of the Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test, among university students. A validation, cross-sectional study, with data collected through a questionnaire comprised of sociodemographic and substance consumption measures (Fagerström test for Nicotine Dependence; Drinking Motives Questionnaire - Revised, and The Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test version 3.1). The sample was composed by 338 students (51.8% male), with a mean age of 20.6 years old (standard deviation = 3.4). To examine the factor structure, an exploratory factor analysis was performed. The internal consistency and convergent validity were also evaluated. The 'Tobacco' and 'Cannabis' subscales were composed by 1 factor and 'Alcoholic Beverages' by 2 factors. Internal consistency ranged between 0.556 and 0.842 (Cronbach's ɑ). Statistically significant associations were observed between being a current smoker, binge-drinking and drinking motives with hazardous consumption (subscales 'Tobacco', 'Alcoholic Beverages' and 'Cannabis'). The observed associations between hazardous consumption, consumption motives and behaviors, may be explained by the relation between alcohol consumption (as part of the academic experience) with substances consumption behavior and polydrug consumption, supporting the adequate convergent validity observed. Also, peer pressure may influence these consumption behaviors. The Portuguese version of the the Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test ('Tobacco', 'Alcoholic Beverages' and 'Cannabis') presented satisfactory psychometric characteristics, showing that it is an adequate instrument to assess hazardous consumption behaviors among university students.
