to evaluate the profile of skin cancer in Pomeranian communities of the State of Esp√≠rito Santo, composed of descendants of European immigrants, regarding gender and age at diagnosis, lesion size and histological type. we studied histopathological reports of 3,781 patients operated between 2000 and 2010, with resection of 4,881 lesions. We assessed histological type, lesion size, age and gender of the patients at diagnosis and their correlations in the 11-year period. the histopathological examination revealed basal cell carcinoma in 3,159 patients (83.5%), squamous cell carcinoma in 415 (11%), melanoma in 64 (1.7%), and 143 patients (3.8%) had combined lesions of basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. As to size, 47.1% measured between 5.1 and 10mm. The age group of 61 to 70 years was the one that sustained the largest number of surgical interventions (24.3%). There was a predominance of the female gender (2,027, 53.6%) in relation to the male (1,754, 46.4%). basal cell carcinoma was the most frequent histological type. The prevalences of squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma were below the national estimate of the National Cancer Institute. The diagnosis of tumors occurred at more advanced ages (above 60 years) and there was an increase in the incidence and size of skin tumors in the male population.
