Susac syndrome is a rare, probably immune-mediated endotheliopathy presenting with encephalopathy, sensorineural hearing loss and retinal arterial occlusions. A 33-year-old female with Susac syndrome was worsening despite high-dose steroids so a brain biopsy was performed which suggested a possible fungal infection. Treatment with amphotericin B resulted in prompt reversal of symptoms and radiological findings, and no further symptoms occurred during 8 years of follow-up. A diagnosis of fungal infection was not confirmed. The etiology of Susac syndrome is unknown and this anecdotal observation suggests that an infectious agent susceptible to amphotericin might have caused or triggered Susac syndrome in this patient.
