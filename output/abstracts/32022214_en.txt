This paper aimed to characterize the productivity costs of people involved in traffic accidents (TA) in a medium-sized municipality. A longitudinal household-based study was conducted from 2013 to 2015. During this period, individuals with TA were interviewed, and followed-up and costs of productivity were calculated. The measured and estimated values were considered for the calculation of the gross and per capita values and facilitated the establishment of costs of lost productivity (days off work) and costs of return to productivity (health professionals, medication, transportation, auxiliary devices and vehicle repair). It was shown that the costs of loss were more significant against the costs of return. Among the items that underpin the return to productivity, higher costs were observed in men, young adults, drivers, users of two-wheeled vehicles, people with public employment relationships, intermediate age groups and fracture-type injuries. It is necessary to evaluate and target the stages of recovery of those involved to minimize the social burden generated by these events.
