Esophageal mucosal bridge is an elastic stretchable structure, connecting across the lumen, extending either obliquely or horizontally, more commonly seen in the mid or lower esophagus. It can be either congenital or secondary (acquired). Acquired ones are secondary to reflux esophagitis, corrosive esophageal injury, drug-induced esophagitis, radiation esophagitis, Crohn's disease, Mallory-Weiss syndrome, malignant tumors, and infections like candidiasis, HSV, CMV, or tuberculosis. We present a case of an elderly female, who presented with progressive dysphagia for 3 months, more commonly to solids without any history of anorexia or weight loss. No history of corrosive ingestion, radiation exposure, or prior history of any surgical or endoscopic intervention was present. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed esophageal mucosal bridge at 20 and 25 cm from incisors and mucosal tag. Endoscopic resection was carried out successfully with hot biopsy forceps and needle knife after prophylactic application of hemoclips at two ends of each bridge, without any adverse event. Esophageal mucosal bridge, though rarely reported, should be kept in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with dysphagia. Endoscopic resection with hot biopsy forceps or needle knife seems to be effective.
