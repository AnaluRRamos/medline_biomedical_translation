Diagnosis of adverse food reaction (AFR) is based on an eight week elimination diet (ED) and is confirmed by relapse upon re-challenge with the previously fed diet. Hydrolysed EDs are commonly used for this purpose. To evaluate the commercially available hydrolysed fish protein and rice starch ED Farmina UltraHypo (FUH) for the diagnosis of feline AFR. Thirty-two nonseasonally pruritic cats. Pruritus was assessed with a new dual Visual Analog Scale, lesions with the Scoring Feline Allergic Dermatitis scale and Quality of Life with a validated questionnaire on days 0 and 56. Short-acting corticosteroids or oclacitinib were permitted during the first six weeks. Cats showing 50% pruritus and/or lesional improvement were separately challenged with their prior diet, fish and rice. Cats not responding to the study diet were fed another hydrolysed diet for two months. Twenty-five cats completed the ED: four dropped out due to vomiting and/or diarrhoea, one owing to low palatability and two were lost to follow-up. In 17 cats, pruritus improved by >50% and these underwent dietary challenges. Of these, nine reacted to their prior diet and/or fish and/or rice and were diagnosed with AFR, while eight did not relapse (and a diagnosis of AFR was considered to be doubtful). Of the eight cats in which pruritus did not improve, four underwent a second ED with no improvement. FUH may be a useful ED for the diagnosis of feline AFR, even in cats reacting to fish or rice.
