To compare the clinical results obtained by using the techniques of open limited fasciectomy (FP) and percutaneous needle fasciectomy (FPC) in patients with Dupuytren's contracture after one year follow up. Thirty-three patients and a total of 50 fingers with Dupuytren's contracture were divided non-randomly and evaluated after undergoing procedures with FP or FPC. The results were evaluated based on the Tubiana classification, DASH score (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand), time until return to professional activities, total passive extension deficit (DTEP), the relationship between the extension deficit and DASH, recurrence and complications. Twenty-six fingers were treated with FPC technique and 24 fingers with FP. The DTEP was significantly lower in FP group (10.23°) when compared to FPC group (23.46°) at 12 months postoperatively (<i>p</i> = 0.038). The remaining items assessed did not show any statistically significant differences. Total passive extension deficit at 12 months is lower in the group of open limited fasciectomy. There are no significant differences between groups FP and FPC over the classification of Tubiana, the DASH score, time until return to professional activities and the incidence of recurrence.
