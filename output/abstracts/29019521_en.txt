The aim was to identify the prevalence of postpartum depression and associated factors in women in a medium-sized city in Southern Brazil during 2013. Trained female interviewers applied a standardized questionnaire to all participants in the city's two maternity hospitals. The study analyzed demographic, socioeconomic, behavioral, social support, and disease characteristics. Screening for depression was done within the first 48 hours postpartum, using the Edinburgh Scale with a cutoff of â‰¥ 10. Multivariate analysis used Poisson regression with robust variance. Of the 2,687 women interviewed, 14% (95%CI: 12.9-15.6) were identified with depression. Factors such as previous depression, third-trimester sadness, and family history of depression were associated with increased risk of postpartum depression, as were younger maternal age and multiparity. Social support from the health team for the pregnant woman was an important protective factor, reducing the prevalence of postpartum depression by 23%. The results suggest the need for actions by health services for pregnant women in order to provide enhanced care during this delicate phase.
