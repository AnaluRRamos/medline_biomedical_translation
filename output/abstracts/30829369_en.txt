The purpose of this study was to describe and characterize (using the tensile test) an alternative handling technique for calcium hydroxide cement in temporary crown cementation. In the group treated with the conventional technique (n=10), the base and catalyst pastes of a calcium hydroxide cement (Dycal) were dispensed at a 1:1 ratio and mixed. The cement was then applied to the internal cervical surfaces of the provisional restoration, and the restoration was placed on the prepared tooth and kept in place with digital pressure. In the group treated with the alternative technique (n=10), the base paste of the calcium hydroxide cement (Dycal) was placed on the tooth and the catalyst paste was inserted into the temporary crown.The provisional prosthesis was placed on the tooth and kept in place with digital pressure. Tensile values were evaluated and compared between groups using Student's t test with a 5% level of significance (α = 0.05). Use of this alternative technique resulted in significantly lower tensile strength compared to the conventional technique (0.58 ± 0.12 vs. 1.08 ± 0.13 MPa; p<0.001). The technique presented here (alternative) could avoid the undesired removal of cemented cast posts or cores at the time of provisional prosthesis removal and ensures the cementation of extensive provisional prostheses with calcium hydroxide cement.
