The article presents a review of Brazilian tobacco control policies from 1986 to 2016, based on contributions from political economics and analyses of public policies. The institutionalization of tobacco control in the country was marked by more general changes in health policies and by specific events related to the theme. Brazil's international leadership role, a robust National Tobacco Control Policy, the role of civil society and the media all contributed to the success of tobacco control in this country. However, challenges remain regarding crop diversification in tobacco farms, illegal trade in cigarettes, pressure from the tobacco industry and the sustainability of the Policy. This study reinforces the importance of bearing in mind the relationship between the domestic and international context, and the articulation between different governmental and non-governmental sectors and players when analyzing complex health policies. Continuity and consolidation of the tobacco control policies depend on the persistence of a broad institutional framework to guide the State's actions in social protection, in accordance with Unified Healthcare System guidelines.
