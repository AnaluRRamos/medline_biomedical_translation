Long-term follow-up of oral fluralaner for canine demodicosis has not been demonstrated. A multicentre prospective open trial for the efficacy of oral fluralaner for the long-term (>12 month) management of canine demodicosis. Client-owned dogs diagnosed with demodicosis at nine veterinary clinics. A single fluralaner dose was administered orally. Although shampoo was allowed to treat secondary pyoderma, no other medication or shampoo was allowed, except for medication for possible underlying disorders. Each dog underwent a thorough parasitological and dermatological assessment monthly for three months and was followed up for >12 months. Twenty-six dogs were enrolled. Their ages ranged from three months to 16 years. The cases were nine juvenile and 17 adult onsets; and 18 generalised and eight localised forms. Fluralaner administration resulted in 100% eradication of mites and complete resolution of all skin lesions at three months. Seventeen dogs were excluded from the one year follow-up evaluation as they had required a second dose of isoxazoline or died from causes unrelated to the fluralaner treatment. In the remaining nine cases, no relapse was observed in any of the dogs (six adult and three juvenile onsets; six generalised and three localised forms). Four dogs were monitored for over one year, one dog for over two years, and four dogs for three years. The results indicated that a single dose of fluralaner could effectively deliver a long-term cure when combined with managing underling conditions.
