Over 44 million people suffer from dementia around the world. Researchers estimated that there will be 48.1 million people with dementia by 2020 and 90.3 million by 2040. In addition to dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and subjective cognitive decline (SCD) relate to cognitive impairment. It has been established that MCI precedes dementia, however the significance of SCD is still unclear. Recent studies suggest that SCD could be a risk factor for objective cognitive impairment. SCD is defined as а self-estimated decline in cognitive capacity in comparison to an individual's previous level of functioning, which cannot be determined by neuropsychological tests. To perform a systematic review of prospective longitudinal cohort studies that assessed the risk of MCI and dementia among people with SCD. A search was carried out for all available peer-reviewed articles in English related to SCD in PubMed and PsychINFO databases from database initiation through January 2020. The keywords used for the search were 'subjective cognitive (or memory) impairment (or decline or complaints)'. Three authors separately determined the inclusion or exclusion of all articles retrieved for full-text evaluation. The chance of progression to dementia in the SCD group was 2.17 (95% confidence interval [95%CI] 1.53‒3.07; p<0.05) compared to normal aging. Furthermore, the SCD group was 2.15 times more likely to progress to MCI than the group without SCD (95%CI 1.39‒3.30; p=0.005). SCD might precede cognitive impairment, however, more detailed longitudinal studies should be conducted.
