Policy development and review, planning, innovation, research, and the measurement of progress, barriers, and opportunities require open access to reliable data, information, and expert knowledge. This is part of the principles of the Pan American Sanitary Code and the Constitution of the Pan American Health Organization. Between 1950 and 1978, the subject of health data collection, in particular vital statistics, was expressly addressed in each of the first seven editions of Health in the Americas. However, despite considerable improvement in data quality, since the early 1980s it has been recognized that countries' health information systems require constant modernization in order to provide health data with better quality, coverage, and timeliness for informed decision-making. With the rise of the Internet, growing access to information and communications technologies--and today, with social networks, the increase in available content--has become massive and is growing in an exponential, unstructured, unclassified, and often uncontrolled manner. This situation forces health institutions to adopt strategies and standards for the management of open data that make it possible to strengthen their quality, confidentiality, and security. We propose a strategy for the governance of health data using tools, concepts, and recommendations that will enable countries to generate open, higher-quality, reliable, and secure data.
