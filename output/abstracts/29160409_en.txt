To analyze the association between postural balance and anthropometric indicators in elementary school students. This cross-sectional, descriptive and quantitative study included children enrolled in the first year of elementary school, of both sexes, in the age group of 6 to 7 years. Children with any physical or cognitive impairment, children who did not participate in all stages of the study evaluation, or those who failed to perform postural balance assessments were excluded. The children underwent a balance evaluation through a computerized dynamic posturograph, with sensory organization tests (TOSs) in six different sensory conditions. In order to verify the anthropometric indicators, the body weight and height measurements were evaluated for later calculation of the body mass index (BMI), which was categorized into four groups: low weight, normal, overweight and obesity. Eighty children with a mean age of 6.2Â±0.8 years were included, being 47 girls (58.8%). The analysis of the anthropometric indicators identified that 26.3% of students were overweight and 15% were obese. The children had averages below the reference values considered for their age range in conditions III and VI. There was a negative association between condition V and BMI and a positive association between values below normal in condition VI with overweight and obesity. There were associations between excess body weight and values below normal in some balance conditions, indicating that the anthropometric indicators interfered in the children's postural balance.
