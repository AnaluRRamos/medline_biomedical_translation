This work evaluates the relationship between ultrasonic reflection and bone density from fourteen cylindrical bovine cortical bone samples (3.0-cm thick). Twenty US reflection signals per sample were acquired along the bone surface (2.0-mm step). The Integrated Reflection Coefficient (IRC) from each signal was compared to Quantitative Computed Tomography (QCT). Seven IRC and QCT curves presented Pearson's Correlation R-values above 0.5. For weak correlation curves, QCT and IRC showed similar trends in several segments. IRC was sensitive to bone density variation. <i><b>Level of Evidence: Experimental Study, Investigating a Diagnostic Test.</b></i>
