In 2015, the number of infants with congenital malformations (CMs) per 100 000 live births (LBs) was 2368 (7.6%) worldwide, of whom 10.6% died in the first year of life, 43% due to malformations of the circulatory system (MCSs), a scenario similar to what occurs in Brazil. To assess, per Brazilian macroregion, whether diagnosis of MCS at birth and death due to MCS in the first year of life associate with human development index (HDI) and with technological and human resources. Ecological study including data available in 2000â€“2015. Data of LBs, deaths and availability of echocardiography devices were obtained from the DATASUS website. The HDI was obtained from the Atlas of Human Development in Brazil, while other variables were obtained from medical demographic data. Correlation measures between the variables were performed using the Kendall index. The CM rate was 660.8/100 000 LBs, of which 18 444 were due to MCS (diagnosis rate, 38.55/100 000 LBs). Of all Brazilian macroregions, the Southern and Southeastern regions, with the highest HDI values and resources, had the highest MCS diagnosis rates (56.94/100 000 and 62.83/100 000 LBs, respectively). The Northern and Northeastern regions, with the lowest HDI values and resources, had the lowest MCS diagnosis rates (9.77/100 000 and 13.43/100 000 LBs, respectively). The MCS diagnosis rate was 6.4-fold higher in the Southeastern region as compared to the Northern region, but mortality rates were similar in both regions. Of the CMs, the MCS accounted for the highest number of deaths in children under the age of 1 year in Brazil.
