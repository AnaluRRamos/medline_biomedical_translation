to create a multidisciplinary conducts manual for tracheostomies in adult and pediatric patients in the Amazonas State Oncology Control Center Foundation. we developed a protocol using the modified Delphi method, which consisted in the application of two series of questionnaires to 20 professionals of the unit. thirteen professionals completed the two steps. In the first stage, there was consensus in 53 out of 92 questions (57.6%). The questions that obtained consensus formed the text of the second stage, divided into eight chapters and evaluated by marking the answers offered on a Linkert scale. All the chapters presented in the second stage obtained consensus, meaning that the sum of the answers 'agree' and 'fully agree' were above 70%. using the data obtained in the consensus, we elaborated a tracheostomy conduct protocol and a care guidelines manual for the patients and their caregivers.
