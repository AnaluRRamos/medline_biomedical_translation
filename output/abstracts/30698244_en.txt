Femur fracture affects the elderly with high morbidity and mortality. The purpose of the present study was to analyze the profile of the assistance given to the elderly who have femoral fractures, relating to their socioeconomic and demographic conditions, in the state of Paran√° between the years 2008 to 2013. These relationships were obtained through factor analysis and the development and analysis of the following rates: PAE - the potential of primary health care to the elderly, whose variable was represented by the contribution of the elderly to the municipal GDP, PAP - the potential of the primary health care to the population, represented by GDP per capita and TE - treatment efficiency represented by the annual rate of fractures and annual rate of death per residence. The municipalities were classified according to the rate variation range. In relation to PAE, 10 municipalities were classified with low potential of care for the elderly, 357 with moderate potential and 32 had low potential. In relation to PAE, 12 municipalities were classified with low potential of primary care for the elderly, 303 with moderate potential and 84 had low potential. In relation to TE, 109 municipalities showed high treatment efficiency, 110 with moderate efficiency and 180 had low efficiency. Our conclusion was that the performance of the economy exerts significant influence on femoral fracture morbidity in the elderly.
