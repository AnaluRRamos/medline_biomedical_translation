As part of the evaluability study of the implementation of the Electronic Patient Record (EPR) evaluation, the aim of this Systematic Review (SR) was to identify the evaluation domains to be addressed. This SR, aligned with the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) encompassed articles published from 2006 to 2019. The search was carried out in the electronic databases SciELO, Oasis IBICT, BVS Regional and Scopus. The search resulted in 1,178 articles, 42 of which met the inclusion criteria. Most studies used qualitative methods for the analyses. The publications took place between 2006 and 2019, with a concentration in 2017 with 9 (21%) articles published in that year. No studies were published in 2008 and 2009. Only 10 studies included the description, analysis or results related to the domains of implementation. The main domains in which the EPR was problematized were: underutilization; professionals' resistance to its use; emphasis on usability; and EPR as an information source. Despite the inclusion of all studies that covered the principles and guidelines of the National Humanization Policy (NHP), they are still incipient.
