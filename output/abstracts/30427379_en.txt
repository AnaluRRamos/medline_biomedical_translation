To present the Griffiths Mental Development Scale (GMDS), as well as its cross-cultural adaptation to Brazil. GMDS is a diagnostic tool for assessing child development. The result of its application allows verifying if development is typical or if there are alterations in a certain specific area (gross motor, personal-social, language, fine-adaptive motor and execution) or global development. After contact with the authors, permission to use GMDS was obtained and in compliance with ethical aspects, the Portuguese version of the instrument was adapted to Brazilian Portuguese with maintenance of semantic, idiomatic, experimental and conceptual equivalences. The adaptation was carried out by two speech therapists, experienced in evaluating infants, who were submitted to training course prior to the application of the instrument. The adapted final version was applied to 21 infants with typical development. Thirty-nine items were adapted without any exclusion. All items were possible to be applied, suitable for the target age group, with no response in any item. GMDS has been trans-culturally adapted in several countries and widely used for performing diagnosis in the age group essential for stimulation with brain plasticity in full development. The cross-cultural adaptation of GMDS for Brazil was carried out, transforming the Brazilian scenario in relation to child care. After normalization and verification of psychometric measures, it was possible, in addition to early diagnosis, to improve the quality of care for this population; carry out cross-cultural studies and publish the results in international journals regarding the feasibility of GMDS being accepted and used worldwide.
