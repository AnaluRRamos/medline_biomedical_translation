To identify the food industry's arguments against front-of-package nutrition labels in Uruguay. Content analysis and inductive coding were applied to the comments made by the food industry during the public consultation on the draft decree regulating the inclusion of front-of-package nutrition labels (warnings) in Uruguay. Most of the comments expressed concern about the high prevalence of obesity and noncommunicable diseases in the country and emphasized a commitment to implementing actions to help combat these health problems. However, 81% of the comments disagreed with the draft decree presented for public consultation; these included general criticisms of its validity. The content of the comments related to seven areas: lack of rationale for the measure; violation of international commitments; criticisms of the warning system; discrimination against industrialized packaged food; criticisms of the nutrient profile model; other criticisms of aspects specific to the draft decree; and adverse economic effects. For each area, there is discussion of the technical and normative relevance and consistency of the content presented by the industry representatives. Despite apparent agreement about the need to adopt measures, it is clear that the food industry is strongly opposed to the policy and, in particular, to the warning system. The results of this analysis may help to facilitate the process of implementing similar regulations in other countries.
