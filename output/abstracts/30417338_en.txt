Since cross-sectional trends of 8-year-old cerebral palsy (CP) birth prevalence based on record review were stable from 1985 to 2002 in Metropolitan Atlanta, we examined birth cohort trends using administrative data sets promptly. Among 755Â 433 live births from 1996 to 2009 in South Carolina, 2080 received CP diagnosis by age 4 years from linked Medicaid claims with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes 343.X (contributing 1061 [51%] unique cases), hospital discharge data (57 [3%] unique cases), and Department of Disabilities and Special Needs program (64 [3%] unique cases). Trends were assessed using negative binominal regression. Including 3.7 percent of cases who died before age 4 years, CP prevalence per 1000 live births decreased significantly from 3.6 in 1996 to 2.1 in 2006 (-3.0% average annual change; 95% confidence interval -4.4 to -1.6). The overall prevalence was 2.8 per 1000 live births, 46.0 per 1000 very-low-birthweight (VLBW) live births, and 53.0 per 1000 VLBW 1-year survivors. Disparities and downward trends persisted across subgroups with higher rates among non-Hispanic black infants than non-Hispanic white and among males compared to females. Downward CP prevalence rates and persistent disparities remain in South Carolina. Further research should validate this methodology, including early deaths, and develop broad surveillance systems to inform clinical practices and etiology. Birth cohort cerebral palsy (CP) prevalence decreased in South Carolina from 1996 to 2009. CP prevalence was higher in very-low-birthweight infants, non-Hispanic blacks, and males. Three administrative data sets captured 2080 patients with CP in South Carolina. Medicaid claims contributed 51% of unique cases of CP to the cohort. CP diagnoses included 76 patients who died before age 4 years.
