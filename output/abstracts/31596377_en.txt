To analyze the prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) according to different diagnostic criteria, in the Brazilian adult population, according to laboratory results from the Brazilian National Health Survey. Analysis of laboratory data from the National Health Survey, collected between 2014 and 2015. The prevalence of diabetes was calculated according to different diagnostic criteria. The prevalence of diabetes was calculated according to the criterion of glycosylated hemoglobin â‰¥ 6.5% or using medication, using Poisson regression and calculating crude and adjusted PR and 95%CI. The prevalence of diabetes according to different criteria varies from 6.6 to 9.4%. Intermediate or pre-diabetes hyperglycemia ranged from 6.8 to 16.9%. Considering laboratory criteria or medication use, the prevalence of DM was 8.4 (95%CI 7.65-9.11). The adjusted PR for gender, age, educational level and region was lower for males (PR 0.75; 95%CI 0.63 - 0.89), increased with age: 30 to 34 years (PR 2.32; 95% CI 1.33 - 4.07), 40 to 59 years PR 8.1; 95%CI 4.86 - 13.46), 60 years old or older (PR 12.6; 95%CI 7.1 - 21.0), and higher educational levels was protective (PR 0.8; 95%CI 0.6 - 0.9). Therewas a higher PR in the Central West Region (PR 1.3; 95%CI 1.04 - 1.7), in overweight people (PR 1.8; 95%CI 1.4 - 2.1), and in obese people (PR 3.3; 95%CI 2.6 - 4.1). The prevalence of diabetes was higher in females, people over 30 years of age, in populations with low educational levels, and people who were overweight and obese. The study advances in determining the diabetes situation in the country through laboratory criteria.
