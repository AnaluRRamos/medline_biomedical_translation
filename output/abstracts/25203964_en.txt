Venous aneurysms are rarely responsible for neck masses, and regarding the neck veins, external jugular vein aneurysms are extremely uncommon, with a few cases reported in the literature. Although most cases are asymptomatic, they may cause pain, be complicated by thrombosis or even rupture. Imaging studies have a role in the diagnosis and surgical planning of this pathology. With emphasis on the imaging techniques, the authors present a case of an external jugular vein aneurysm, initially asymptomatic but thereafter complicated with thrombosis.
