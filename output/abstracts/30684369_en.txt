Yellow fever is a vector-borne disease in sub-Saharan Africa and tropical South America regions which is preventable by an effective and safe vaccine. In some cases, it may cause serious adverse effects and should therefore be prescribed only to individuals at risk of exposure to the yellow fever virus or those traveling to countries requiring proof of vaccination. The aim of this study was to analyze the prescriptions of yellow fever vaccine, based on travel destination and type of referring consultation, according to the international recommendations of the World Health Organization. The database of the International Vaccination Centre of the International Vaccination Centre of the Loures-Odivelas Health Centre Group was used to analyze data concerning the year of 2016. Travelers who were prescribed and administered the yellow fever vaccine were grouped based on travel destination and type of referring consultation (travelers' medical consultations or non-specialist consultations). A total of 517 yellow fever vaccines were administered, with the highest proportion in female (53%) and in individuals aged 40 - 49 years (20.7%). One hundred and thirteen (22.6%) of the 499 individuals with known-destinations were travelling to non-endemic/non-epidemic countries and a greater proportion of those were prescribed in non-specialist consultations (27.3%) than in travel medicine consultations (8.8%). The highest percentage of yellow fever vaccines that were administered to individuals travelling to non-endemic/non-epidemic countries were prescribed in non-specialist consultations.
