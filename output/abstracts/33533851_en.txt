The objective of this study was to analyze the temporal trend of the incidence coefficients of HIV-AIDS infection via a retrospective ecological study and segmented regression in individuals older than 13 year reported at SINAN between 1980 and 2016. Of the 14,204 reported cases, 70.9% were male and 39.5% were white. The AIDS criterion presented growing incidence from 1986 to 1996 with Annual Percentual Change (APC) of 108.5% per year between 1983 and 1989 (CI: 90.3 - 128.4), between 1989 and 1998 the APC was 13.2% (CI: 8.2 - 18.3) and APC reduction in the period from 1998 to 2016, -6.2% (CI: -7.4 - -4.9). High coefficients of the death criteria between 1988 and 2002 (4.7/100,000 inhabitants), with a noticeable decrease after 1995. The growth of the HIV+ criteria from 2000 onward was observed, reaching 30.2 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in 2016. Although incidence rates still remain high in the municipality, these trends are consistent with the positive impact of early detection policies and access to clinical and therapeutic follow-up of individuals with HIV and AIDS in Campinas.
