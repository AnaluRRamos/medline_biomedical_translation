Contrast computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are widely used due to its image quality and ability to study pancreatic and peripancreatic morphology. The understanding of the various subtypes of the disease and identification of possible complications requires a familiarity with the terminology, which allows effective communication between the different members of the multidisciplinary team. Demonstrate the terminology and parameters to identify the different classifications and findings of the disease based on the international consensus for acute pancreatitis ( Atlanta Classification 2012). Search and analysis of articles in the 'CAPES Portal de Peri√≥dicos with headings 'acute pancreatitis' and 'Atlanta Review'. Were selected 23 articles containing radiological descriptions, management or statistical data related to pathology. Additional statistical data were obtained from Datasus and Population Census 2010. The radiological diagnostic criterion adopted was the Radiology American College system. The 'acute pancreatitis - 2012 Rating: Review Atlanta classification and definitions for international consensus' tries to eliminate inconsistency and divergence from the determination of uniformity to the radiological findings, especially the terminology related to fluid collections. More broadly as 'pancreatic abscess' and 'phlegmon' went into disuse and the evolution of the collection of patient fluids can be described as 'acute peripancreatic collections', 'acute necrotic collections', 'pseudocyst' and 'necrosis pancreatic walled or isolated'. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance represent the best techniques with sequential images available for diagnosis. Standardization of the terminology is critical and should improve the management of patients with multiple professionals care, risk stratification and adequate treatment.
