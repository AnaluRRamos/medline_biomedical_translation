The article 'Translation and Validation of the FOUR Scale for Children and its Use as Outcome Predictor: A Pilot Study', published by Acta Médica Portuguesa on September 2017 [Acta Med Port 2017 Sep;30(9):599-607] exhibited the mistake detailed here below: On page 600, paragrapah 4, where it reads: '(...) only the last two are assessed by the GCS and depth of coma may not be accurately detected.4' It should read: '(…) GCS does not include important indicators for an adequate evaluation of coma severity, that is, it only evaluates the cortical function, not including brainstem function evaluation parameters such as respiratory pattern, pupil size and reflexes, nor eye movements; as such it may not detect the coma depth properly.4' Article published with the error: https://www.actamedicaportuguesa.com/revista/index.php/amp/article/view/8052.
