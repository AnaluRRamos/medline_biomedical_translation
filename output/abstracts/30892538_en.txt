Malnutrition is a major factor in the evolution of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis (HD). It is associated with increased frequency and the duration of hospitalizations. The scope of this study was to evaluate the nutritional status of patients with CKD on HD in public or private clinics of the Unified Health System in the Federal District. Sociodemographic, biochemical and anthropometric data were obtained from 96 participants, 35.5% of which were from public clinics. Parameters for evaluation of malnutrition in CKD included Body Mass Index (BMI) < 23 kg/m2, reduced arm muscle circumference (AMC) and serum albumin < 3.8 g/dL. From all participants, 14.6% were classified as malnourished (60 ± 12 years; 57% male; 69% private clinics); 33.3% presented adequate nutritional status (55 ± 14 years; 53% male; 57% private clinics); 52.1% had at least one parameter related to malnutrition. BMI below the recommended parameter was the most prevalent variable (42.7%), followed by reduced AMC (41.7%) and serum albumin (33.3%). Based on these results, it may be concluded that at least one positive variable was related to malnutrition in half of the sample, which reinforces the importance of nutritional assessment in the context of the treatment of CKD.
