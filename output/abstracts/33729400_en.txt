HIV infection is the subject of one of the chapters of the 'Clinical Protocol and Therapeutic Guidelines for Comprehensive Care for People with Sexually Transmitted Infections', published by the Brazilian Ministry of Health in 2020. It is important that health professionals and managers learn the signs and symptoms of HIV infection and know how to diagnose it, in order to provide appropriate treatment and reduce complications. HIV infection has become a chronic disease and its treatment includes addressing common comorbidities in clinical practice such as arterial hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia, in addition to cardiac risk assessment, cancer prevention and guidance on immunization. Initiation of treatment for all HIV patients, regardless of clinical or immunological criteria, adopted by the Ministry of Health since 2013, has now been simplified with more tolerable first-line medications and with fewer drug interactions, which makes its management easy to implement, including by Primary Health Care.
