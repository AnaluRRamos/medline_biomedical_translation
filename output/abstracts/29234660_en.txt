Spinal tuberculosis (Pott disease) can produce severe deformities when it is not properly treated. Long instrumentations through single or combined double approaches are usually required to prevent and correct the deformity. The authors present a case of severe deformity secondary to tuberculous spondylodiscitis in the lumbar spine treated with a monosegmental instrumentation through a double approach in a patient with idiopathic scoliosis. Deformity correction and infection resolution through debridement and arthrodesis is observed after one year of follow-up.
