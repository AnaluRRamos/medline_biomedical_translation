To determine the frequency of hip pain in competitive bodybuilders over three different bodybuilding competitions. This study evaluated bodybuilders recruited from three competitions during the year of 2016. All participants provided their informed consent and the study received IRB approval. Training routine, health condition, level of success on competitions, history of hip pain and physical examination of the hip were evaluated. 113 bodybuilders were evaluated, mean age was 30.5 ± 8.65 years and mean BMI was 25.2 ± 3.65 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Mean values for hip flexion, adduction, abduction, internal rotation, external rotation and distance between the knee and the table (FABER distance) were 116 ± 13, 23 ± 8, 71 ± 12, 40 ± 10, 36 ± 9 and 19 ± 4, respectively. Eight (7%) participants presented hip pain within the week prior to examination and only 2 (1,7%) presented with anterior impingement sign. None of the athletes who reported hip pain interrupted their physical training or performance. Symptomatic athletes continued their training program under the presence of hip pain. The frequency of hip pain among bodybuilders is high and may be underestimated in this study. <b>Level of Evidence IV, Case series.</b>
