The superimposed clinical features of motor neuron disease (MND) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) comprise a distinct, yet not fully understood, neurological overlap syndrome whose clinicopathological basis has recently been reviewed. Here, we present a review of the clinical, pathological and genetic basis of MND-FTD and the role of MRI in its diagnosis. In doing so, we discuss current techniques that depict the involvement of the selective corticospinal tract (CST) and temporal lobe in MND-FTD.
