The scope of this paper was to evaluate the satisfaction regarding dental care services and to identify the association between dissatisfaction and contextual/individual variables. It involved a cross-sectional study of a representative sample of 8,943 adults from 177 municipalities, in which 14.9% of adults were dissatisfied. In the multiple analysis there was a greater chance of dissatisfaction with dental services among adults residing in cities with greater social inequality (OR: 1.53, 95% CI: 1.31-1.81) and with a lower proportion of dentists per inhabitant (OR: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.00-1.37); yellow/black/brown/indigenous (OR: 1.12; 95% CI: 0.99-1.27); lower schooling (OR: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.98-1.33); consultation due to oral problems (OR: 1.23; 95% CI: 1.04-1.44); (OR: 2.60; 95% CI: 2.53-3.02) and impact of oral disorders on daily performance (OR: 1.48; 95% CI: 1.30-1.69). The implementation or adequacy of public policies with the aim of improving satisfaction with dental services should prioritize those municipalities with greater social inequality and with fewer dentists and socially disadvantaged users, who self-perceive oral problems, are dissatisfied with their oral health and suffer impacts resulting from oral problems.
