To analyze the association between the surgical characteristics of breast implants, time elapsed since surgery, access route, implant placement and implanted volume and variables related to breastfeeding, type, first 'milk let-down', breast engorgement, pain, lesion, milk production and use of galactagogues. A prospective cohort carried out during the hospital stay (12 to 72 hours after delivery), home care (5thto 7thday after delivery) and telephone contact (between the 30thand 32ndday postpartum) of 115 postpartum women with breast implants between 2015 and 2017. The first evaluation identified more frequent use of oral galactagogues (p=0.029) by puerperal women with prepectoral implants, and of oxytocin spray by those with implants up to 270 ml (p=0.040). The second evaluation showed a higher pain score among those with prepectoral implants (p=0.046). Around the 30thday postpartum, the presence of nipple lesion (p=0.021), pain (p=0.025) and a higher pain score (p=0.039) was more frequent among those with mammoplasty performed less than 10 years ago. The presence of pain and a higher pain score, the occurrence of lesion and the use of oral and nasal galactagogues were associated with implant placement, implant size and time elapsed since surgery.
