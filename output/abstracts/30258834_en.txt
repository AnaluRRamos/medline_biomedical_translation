Among the patterns of acetabular osteolysis associated with acetabular loosening, the authors emphasize the severity of pelvic dissociation and medial segmental losses in which the quadrilateral lamina is severely affected. Such lesions are potentially lethal in cases of large vascular injury. This note aimed to describe a modified iliofemoral approach in cases of massive intrapelvic migration of the acetabular component in patients with total proximity of the iliac vascular bundle and absence of an anatomical demarcation plane between the migrated contents and the iliac bundle. This approach was performed in 12 of 21 patients who had these criteria.
