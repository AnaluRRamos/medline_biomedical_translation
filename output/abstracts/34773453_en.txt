Post-partum hemorrhage is one of the leading causes of maternal mortality and it's etiology needs to be identified in order for adequate treatment to be provided. We report a case of a post-partum hemorrhage in a multiparous woman treated with selective coil packing embolization after identification of laceration of the right uterine artery's ascending branch. The patient was admitted to an intensive care unit in hemorrhagic hypovolemic shock and disseminated intravascular coagulation and underwent total hysterectomy due to infectious complications.
