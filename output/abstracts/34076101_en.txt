To present a proposal for speech-language pathology rehabilitation called the Therapy Program for Management of Chronic Cough (TMCC) for the treatment of refractory chronic cough. TMCC was developed based on two stages: literature and clinical analysis. The literature analysis stage was carried out through the following procedures: electronic and manual search for articles and books published until June 2019 that included adult participants with chronic cough and intervention with speech-language pathology therapy; selection of sources; analysis of articles and books included; and, preparation of the initial version of the therapy program. The initial version of the therapy program resulting from literature analysis stage was submitted to clinical analysis stage through the following procedures: analysis by three judges; revision of the proposal by the authors; judges' re-analysis; elaboration of the final version called the Therapy Program for Management of Chronic Cough (TMCC). TMCC synthesizes scientific knowledge and current clinical experience on the behavioral management of refractory chronic cough into a program with three main components, each one with specific objectives and strategies. TMCC consists of four sessions, with weekly frequency and duration between 30-45 minutes per session, executed in hierarchical phases, with specific objectives and strategies per session. TMCC is a program structured to offer global cough rehabilitation. To obtain scientific evidence about its effectiveness is necessary, so that it can be used in clinical practice.
