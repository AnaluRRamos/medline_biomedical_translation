The placement of percutaneous endoscopic gastrojejunostomy (PEG-J) provides diet delivery beyond the angle of Treitz, and it is associated with decrease of complications related to gastroparesis, such as aspiration pneumonia. There are many different techniques to perform a PEG-J described in the literature, with variable degrees of technical success. In this article, we suggest modifications to the technique of PEG-J placement in order to reduce time of procedure and minimize the risk of technical failure.
