The objective of our study was to evaluate if functional training with the Functional Movement Screen (FMS) can reduce the risk of a new injury for patients that underwent an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Our hypothesis was that the functional training might reduce the risk of a new injury. Our training protocol consisted of six phases, each one lasting six weeks. It began two months after surgery. The study group was composed of 10 individuals that completed our protocol after ACLR. The control group consisted of 10 people that completed a regular ACLR rehabilitation protocol. The FMS was used to compare the study and control group performance. Patients with a score of 14 or less on the FMS were considered more likely to suffer an injury than those with a score higher than 14. The study group average FMS score was 16.6 compared to the control group at 12.3. Functional training for ACLR rehabilitation added a statistically significant benefit (<i>p</i> < 0.0002) to reduce the risk of a new injury compared to regular protocol. Functional training may be considered an alternative to the regular ACLR rehabilitation to reduce the risk of a new injury before returning to sports. <i>Level of Evidence III, Case control study.</i>
