To assess the contribution of gerontotechnologies in nursing care to older adults with Parkinson's disease, aiming at the prevention of falls. Convergent Assistance Research, through the development and evaluation of gerontechnologies focused on the prevention of falls in older adults with Parkinson's Disease. Clinical evaluation, interviews and workshops with older adults were carried out, as well as analysis and judgment of the materials developed by ten judges certified in gerontology by the Brazilian Society of Geriatrics and Gerontology.
