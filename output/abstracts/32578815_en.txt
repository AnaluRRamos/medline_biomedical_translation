To evaluate the potential use of REBOA in a Brazilian hospital. We performed a retrospective analysis of all requests for emergency surgical evaluation for patients with suspected massive hemorrhage, hospitalized in a private Brazilian general hospital, from April 1, 2017 to March 31, 2018. Inclusion criteria for REBOA eligibility were: suspected abdominal and/or pelvic bleeding, hemorrhagic shock and older than 18 years of age. Exclusion criteria were: older than 70 years of age, and pre-existing terminal disease or significant comorbidities. 90 evaluations were requested during the study period. However, according to our inclusion/exclusion criteria, only on 14 occasions (15.6%) there was a recommendation for the use of REBOA. Gynecological/obstetric conditions were the indication in 11 cases (78.6%) and elective oncologic surgery in three cases (21.4%). The use of REBOA is not common in our country, but it can be an essential tool, and perhaps the last resource in extremely severe conditions until the definitive surgical, endovascular or endoscopic treatment is performed.
