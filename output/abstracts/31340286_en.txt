The scope of this article was to assess the association between Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) and depression among Brazilian adults. This cross-sectional study used data from the 2013 National Health Survey with a representative sample of 49,025 Brazilian adults, with information on IPV, depression and socio-demographic conditions. For a description of characteristics associated with depression, including the core IPV data, analyses of simple and multiple logistic regression were performed. The analyses were performed using Stata 13.0 software. The prevalence of IPV was 1% in the general population, and 0.38% among men and 1.58% among women. The prevalence of depression was 3.94% (CI 95% = 3.68-4.22) in the general population, 1.67% (CI 95% = 1.40-1.94) among men and 6.03% (CI 95% = 5.57- 6.48) among women. Victims of IPV were more likely to report depression than non-victims (aOR = 2.90; CI 95% = 1.38-6.09). The conclusion drawn is that depression is associated with intimate partner victimization, which has important implications from a public health standpoint.
