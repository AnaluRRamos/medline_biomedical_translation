Chile is facing changes associated with the demographic transition. So far, these challenges have been framed as age related. This has contributed to approaching a broad set of issues from a narrow perspective. The focus on aging has fragmented a multidisciplinary problem into different parts-particularly health and social policies-with different actors dealing with it from the perspective of their own sector. This process has generated an incomplete picture, preventing the definition and measurement of dependency and long-term care, and hindering a coordinated response to these issues. This article advocates for a change in the definition of the problem, by adopting the concept of long-term care, in order to gain a deeper and more comprehensive perspective on the issues arising from the situation that Chile is experiencing.
