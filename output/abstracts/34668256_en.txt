Host-microbe interactions may influence dermatitis pathogenesis in the nasomaxillary folds of French bulldogs, which is often complicated by secondary bacterial and fungal infections. To assess the skin-fold microbiome in systemically healthy French bulldogs and to determine the influence of topical medications on this microbiome. Nineteen healthy French bulldogs. Next-generation DNA sequencing was applied to characterise the microbiome composition in the nasomaxillary folds of systemically healthy French bulldogs. Subsequently, the effect of two topical products on the fold microbiome was assessed. Seven dogs were treated with a protease product (Kalzyme; enzyme) that inhibits biofilm formation without biocidal activity, six dogs were treated with a 2% chlorhexidine diacetate solution (Nolvasan; CHX) with biocidal activity, and six dogs were untreated. Dogs were randomly assigned to each group, and the investigator was blinded. The primary skin bacterial phyla inhabiting the folds at inclusion were Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. The primary skin fungal phyla were Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. Topical treatment increased the diversity of bacterial and fungal compositions over time (increase in microbial diversity score: enzyme 38%, chlorhexidine 11%, control <5%) and the relative abundance of pathogens reduced significantly (enzyme, P = 0.028; CHX, P = 0.048). A clear correlation (r<sup>2</sup>  = 0.83) was observed between the abundance of clinically relevant pathogens and microbial diversity. The nasomaxillary skin-fold microbiome of healthy French bulldogs contained a high abundance of clinically relevant pathogens (mean 36.4%). Topical therapy with enzyme increased microbial diversity of skin folds and reduced the relative abundance of pathogens.
