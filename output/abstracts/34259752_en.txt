Primary healthcare is essential for dealing with the iniquities marking rural and remote territories. The concept of rurality is somewhat imprecise, and rural health policies in Brazil are insufficient. A review of the international literature can foster better understanding of the strategies developed in central rural health issues. The article's objective was to identify and analyze the challenges in access, organization of healthcare, and health workforce in primary care in rural areas. An integrative literature review was performed to search for scientific articles published from 2000 to 2019 in the Cochrane and MEDLINE databases and specific rural health journals. The search yielded 69 articles, categorized as addressing access, organization of healthcare, or health workforce. The findings' main themes were analyzed. Articles classified as access presented the following central themes: geographic aspects, patients' needs to travel for care, and access to hospital and specialized services. Articles on organization of healthcare dealt with structure and inputs, functioning of health services, and community-based management. Health workforce featured healthcare workers' profiles and roles and factors for their attraction/retention. Crosscutting issues in strengthening access, organization of healthcare, and health workforce in rural areas were community action, outreach/visiting models, communication/information technologies, access to care, and professional training/development. The review provides a comprehensive understanding of primary care in rural health to promote equity for rural populations.
