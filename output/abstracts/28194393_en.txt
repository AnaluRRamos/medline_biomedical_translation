An open fracture of the calcaneus with loss of substance is a challenging injury and requires specialized care, involves high costs, and demands attention despite its lower incidence. The main complications are osteomyelitis, pressure ulcers, and fistulas, as well as pain conditions in the lateral, medial, and plantar regions. This is due to the wide loss of tissue and the change in anatomical conformation of the calcaneus in some cases. However, in cases of flattening of the calcaneus bone, these complications may be prevented or treated successfully. This technical note describes the resection osteotomy technique for calcaneus flattening to prevent and treat complications after micro-surgical flap in cases of open fracture or loss of substance.
