To discuss how care-permanence comprehensiveness is for patients undergoing treatment in nephrology. A qualitative, exploratory and descriptive study anchored in Sociopoetics, conducted in the first semester of 2018, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with nurses from nephrology services. The data were produced after applying the creative technique with drawings and collages and taking recorded statements about the signifieds and signfiers of care-permanence. The analysis was performed based on the principles of Sociopoetics from the philosophical conceptions of the research groups. Fifteen (15) nurses with experience in nephrology services participated in this study. Four conceptual axes were shared referring to: comprehensive care; complex care; continuous care; and inclusive care, which considers the patient's family, team, society and their context, in addition to the patient themselves. A philosophical reflection on care of the human being implies considering the physical, emotional, and individual dimensions, but also its micro and macromolecular revolutions of existence as a social being. The nature of knowledge from the ludic production enabled reflection and awareness for all the time and at all times about the comprehensiveness of care by nurses in nephrology.
