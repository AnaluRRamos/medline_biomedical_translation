To describe the socio-demographic and clinical-epidemiological characteristics and to determine the factors associated with the mortality of people diagnosed with tuberculosis (TB) in Paraguay. Operational research with a retrospective cohort design of cases diagnosed with TB in Paraguay between 2015-2016. The database of the National Tuberculosis Control Program was used. Chi-square and relative risk (RR) tests with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were used to determine the factors associated with mortality; in addition, a robust Poisson multiple regression model was adjusted. A significance level of 5% was used. Five hundred and forty-one cases of TB were studied, of which 11.5% died. The factors increasing the risk of death were male sex (RR 1.26; 95% CI 1.1-1.50), infection with human immunodeficiency virus (RR 4.78; 95% CI 4.04-5.65) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (RR 1.70; 95% CI 1.19-2.42). Being deprived of one's liberty was a protective factor (RR 0.37; 95% CI 0.24-0.61). The highest risk of death is presented by men and people with TB/HIV coinfection and the lowest risk is presented by people deprived of liberty. There is a need to improve diagnosis and follow-up of TB cases, with effective implementation of directly observed treatment (DOTS) and timely management of associated diseases such as HIV and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
