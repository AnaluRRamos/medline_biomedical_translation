To determine whether an interim <sup>18</sup>F-fluoride positron-emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) study performed after the third cycle of radium-223 dichloride (<sup>223</sup>RaCl<sub>2</sub>) therapy is able to identify patients that will not respond to treatment. We retrospectively reviewed 34 histologically confirmed cases of hormone-refractory prostate cancer with bone metastasis in patients submitted to <sup>223</sup>RaCl<sub>2</sub> therapy. All of the patients underwent baseline and interim <sup>18</sup>F-fluoride PET/CT studies. The interim study was performed immediately prior to the fourth cycle of <sup>223</sup>RaCl<sub>2</sub>. The skeletal tumor burden-expressed as the total lesion fluoride uptake above a maximum standardized uptake value of 10 (TLF<sub>10</sub>)-was calculated for the baseline and the interim studies. The percent change in TLF<sub>10</sub> between the baseline and interim studies (%TFL<sub>10</sub>) was calculated as follows: %TFL<sub>10</sub> = interim TLF<sub>10</sub> - baseline TLF<sub>10</sub> / baseline TLF<sub>10</sub>. End points were overall survival, progression-free survival, and skeletal-related events. The mean age of the patients was 72.4 Â± 10.2 years (range, 43.3-88.8 years). The %TLF<sub>10</sub> was not able to predict overall survival (<i>p</i> = 0.6320; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.753; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.236-2.401), progression-free survival (<i>p</i> = 0.5908; HR = 1.248; 95% CI: 0.557-2.797) nor time to a bone event (<i>p</i> = 0.5114; HR = 1.588; 95% CI: 0.399-6.312). The skeletal tumor burden on an interim <sup>18</sup>F-fluoride PET/CT, performed after three cycles of <sup>223</sup>RaCl<sub>2</sub>, is not able to predict overall survival, progression-free survival, or time to bone event, and should not be performed to monitor response at this time.
