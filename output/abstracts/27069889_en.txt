To ascertain thickness measurements on the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in its middle third on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and to assess whether there is any association between variations in ligament thickness and patients' heights and ages, along with variations in the anatomical measurements on the knee. MRI scans on 48 knees were evaluated. The anteroposterior size of the femoral condyles, interepicondylar distance, intercondylar distance and anteroposterior and mediolateral thicknesses of the ACL were measured. It was assessed whether there was any statistical relationship between ACL thickness and the patients' age, height or other measurements evaluated. The mean thickness of the middle third of the ACL was 4.5 mm in the sagittal plane and 4.3 mm in the frontal plane. The anteroposterior thickness of the ACL in its middle third had a positive relationship with the size of the lateral condyle. The mediolateral thickness of the ACL in its middle third had a positive relationship with the size of the lateral condyle and with the intercondylar distance in the axial plane. There was no relationship between the thickness of the ACL and the patients' age or height. The thickness of the ACL presented positive associations with the size of the lateral femoral condyle and the intercondylar distance.
