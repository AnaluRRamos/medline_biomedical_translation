To compare the clinical and radiological outcomes of conventional medial and lateral approaches for total knee replacement in the valgus osteoarthritic knee. In this randomized controlled trial, 21 patients with valgus knee osteoarthritis were randomized to total knee replacement through medial or lateral approach. The primary outcome was radiographic patellar tilt. Secondary outcomes were visual analog scale of pain, postoperative levels of hemoglobin, and clinical aspect of the operative wound. There were no differences between the groups regarding other clinical variables. Mean lateral tilt of the patella was 3.1 degrees (SD ± 5.3) in the lateral approach group and 18 degrees (SD ± 10.2) in the medial approach group (<i>p</i> = 0.02). There were no differences regarding the secondary outcomes. Lateral approach provided better patellar tilt following total knee replacement in valgus osteoarthritic knee.
