To evaluate tuberculosis control actions in one large Brazilian municipality. Quantitative, cross-sectional study, with a population (N=137) of patients with tuberculosis notified in the Sistema de Informação de Agravos e Notificação (Brazilian Case Registry Database). The final sample (n = 75) was obtained based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. The studied variables were: 'health center in charge of diagnosing tuberculosis', 'time elapsed since the onset of signs and symptoms until diagnosis of tuberculosis', 'health center in charge of providing treatment of tuberculosis' and 'type of tuberculosis treatment'. Data were collected between March and July of 2015, and were obtained from structured interviews and analyzed through descriptive and analytic statistics by Chi square test method, using the R software. The study identified that tuberculosis control actions are focused on specialized services and the private network, which contributes to a late diagnosis, and hinder the interruption of disease transmission. Self-administered treatment was also observed, modality that favors the antagonistic outcome of the treatment.
