Minimal invasive cardiac surgery by right mini-thoracotomy for cardiac mass resection has emerged as an alternative to median sternotomy, for being less associated to postoperative complications and a faster recovery. Thoracic radiotherapy, widely used for cancer treatment, can result in pulmonary adhesions making it impossible to access the heart by thoracotomy. We report a case of a patient submitted to bilateral thoracic radiotherapy, with a cardiac mass in the left atrium, successfully treated by surgical resection, as well the intraoperative procedure done to make the minimally invasive approach possible.
