The definition of complex chronic health condition (CCHC) is important for identifying children and adolescents occupying pediatric beds in Brazilian hospitals, where they live out their childhood, requiring complex care by multidisciplinary teams in network format both in-hospital and in home care. The current article addresses guidelines for a line of care for children and adolescents with CCHCs. An expert panel validated 13 guidelines organized in three dimensions. Using the consensus conference technique, experts from different specialties validated the guidelines. We concluded that the process requires planning, professional training, and the production of an inter-sector research agenda involving other definitions, reviewing norms and conventions as to what is expected. Expectations include the ideal professional composition and profile for comprehensive care of these children and adolescents with CCHCs and safeguards for their rights, with access to a wide variety of social equipment, including but not limited to the health sector.
