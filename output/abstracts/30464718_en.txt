The purpose is to compare the incidence and characteristics of injuries sustained in two consecutive seasons of the São Paulo State Football Championship. Prospective study performed using an electronic form previously developed by the Medical Committee of the São Paulo State Football Federation, sent to the physicians responsible for the tournament's series A1 and A2 teams, after each round. 17.63 injuries sustained per 1000 hours of matches in the A1 series and 14.91 injuries sustained per 1000 hours of matches in the A2 series. Incidence of injuries per 1000 hours of matches decreased from 24.16 to 17.63 in the A1 series (p<0.037) and from 19.10 to 14.01 in the A2 series (p<0.064). External defenders suffered most injuries, while muscular injuries were most common and lower limbs, the most affected areas. Most injuries occurred between 30 and 45 minutes of the match and only 11.9% of the injuries required surgery. Prevalence and frequency of injuries decreased between seasons. Most injuries were sustained in the lower limbs; strains were the most common injuries, followed by strains and contusions; MRIs were the most frequently requested exams and most injuries were classified as moderate (8-28 days). <i><b>Level of evidence III, Cross-Sectional Study.</b></i>
