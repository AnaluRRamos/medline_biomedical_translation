To evaluate the results obtained in the repair of distal biceps injury using the single-incision approach with endobutton use; complications; and ability to return to sport. 14 athletes with rupture of the distal tendon of the biceps brachii submitted to surgical repair using a single route with endobutton were evaluated. The parameters analyzed were: Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS), flexion-extension range of motion and pronation-supination, and the ability to return to sports practice. Most injuries were related to weightlifting (57.1%), vaquejada (35.7%) and judo (7.2%). All operated patients returned to sports activities, maintaining the elbow range of motion. Two cases faced complications due to neuropraxia (one case affecting the posterior interosseous nerve and the other the radial sensitive nerve). However, there was spontaneous resolution in 10 weeks of follow-up. One case - due to the late presentation and presence of fibrotic adhesions - evolved with a deficit of the lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm and later with osteolysis and heterotopic ossification. Repair of the distal tendon of the biceps by the one-way technique is a safe method, with a low complication rate and a short rehabilitation period. <i>Level of Evidence III, Retrospective comparative study.</i>
