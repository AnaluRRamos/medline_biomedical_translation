To evaluate the late clinical and radiological results of patients had locking plate anatomically compatible from superior surface and muscle cover on plate due to clavicle mid-region. Forty patients were included retrospectively. Patients had a routine right shoulder anterior posterior graph after examination. The results were assessed by returning to the patient's daily activities, Constant score, the Disability of the Arm, and Shoulder and Hand scoring, followed by radiological and clinical examination. Fourteen (35%) patients were female and 26 (65%) were male. The mean age was 36.2 years. Twenty-six patients had right clavicle fracture and 14 patients had left. Twenty-three fractures were type 2B1 and 17 fractures were type 2B2. Mean follow-up time was 36.4 months. Radiologic union was at a mean of 9.1 ± 1.3 weeks. All patients had excellent results. The mean Constant score was 97.2 ± 1.8, the mean Disability of the Arm, and Shoulder and Hand score was 3.8 ± 2.4. It is possible to obtain complete union with high patient satisfaction by avoiding the complications and difficulties of the conservative treatment with the use of the anatomically compatible locking plates in superior fixation and our surgical dissection. <i>Level of Evidence III, Retrospective Case controlled study.</i>
