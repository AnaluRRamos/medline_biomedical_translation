The aim of the present study was to provide a better understanding of the specific action of two follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) isoforms (β-follitropin and sheep FSH) on the membrane potential of human cumulus cells.  Electrophysiological data were associated with the characteristics of the patient, such as age and cause of infertility. The membrane potential of cumulus cells was recorded with borosilicate microelectrodes filled with KCl (3 M) with tip resistance of 15 to 25 MΩ. Sheep FSH and β-follitropin were topically administered onto the cells after stabilization of the resting potential for at least 5 minutes.  In cumulus cells, the mean resting membrane potential was - 34.02 ± 2.04 mV (<i>n</i> = 14). The mean membrane resistance was 16.5 ± 1.8 MΩ (<i>n</i> = 14). Sheep FSH (4 mUI/mL) and β-follitropin (4 mUI/mL) produced depolarization in the membrane potential 180 and 120 seconds after the administration of the hormone, respectively.  Both FSH isoforms induced similar depolarization patterns, but β-follitropin presented a faster response. A better understanding of the differences of the effects of FSH isoforms on cell membrane potential shall contribute to improve the use of gonadotrophins in fertility treatments.
