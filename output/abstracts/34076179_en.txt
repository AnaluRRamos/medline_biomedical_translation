To compare the effect of non-nutritive sucking, 25% oral glucose and 25% oral glucose combined with non-nutritive sucking in pain relief in premature infants submitted to heel puncture for blood glucose monitoring. This is a randomized crossover clinical trial with 34 preterm infants who randomly received interventions: non-nutritive sucking, 25% oral glucose and the two interventions combined for three consecutive days in heel puncture for blood glucose monitoring. Assessment by the Premature Infant Pain Profile for 30 seconds before the intervention, called the baseline period and for 5 minutes after puncture. The combination of interventions made the premature infants return to baseline, with 1 minute and 30 seconds after heel puncture, promoting a 2.2% percentage reduction in the scale. Comparing the effect of isolated and combined interventions showed that, when offered in combination, preterm infants were able to return to baseline parameters more quickly.
