Based on accounts of a hagiographic nature on brother Fabian of Christ and witness reports by the faithful after his death, this article analyzes the representations surrounding the death of the servant of god and studies the connections between the veneration of saints and healing practices in Rio de Janeiro in the mid-eighteenth century.
