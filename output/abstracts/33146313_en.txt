Vaccination is one of the greatest public health interventions, based on its safety and effectiveness, but vaccination does not always mean immunization. Numerous aspects related both to the individual that receives the vaccine and the specificity of each vaccine administered are part of the process of obtaining adequate immunization, and it is essential to observe the aspects in order to avoid vaccine failures. The analysis of immunogenicity and effectiveness studies for the measles, varicella, and mumps vaccines point to the need to incorporate two doses into the basic vaccination calendars in order to control these diseases. Epidemiological studies that analyzed outbreaks of these diseases identified cases in individuals that received two doses of the vaccine, which may indicate likely secondary failure. For the yellow fever vaccine, the current discussion lies in the ideal number of doses for individual protection. The World Health Organization recommends a single dose for life. Despite the few reports in the literature concerning vaccine failures, immunogenicity studies demonstrate waning protection over the years, mainly in the pediatric age bracket. In the current scenario of elimination and control of diseases, associated with the decrease in the circulation of the wild-type viruses, the role of epidemiological surveillance is crucial for expanding knowledge on the multiple factors involved, culminating in vaccine failures and the emergence of outbreaks. Outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases negatively impact the credibility of immunization programs, leading to low vaccination coverage rates and interfering in vaccination's success.
