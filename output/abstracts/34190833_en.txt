The study aimed to analyze the adoption and use of the Primary Healthcare e-SUS (PHC e-SUS) as a technological innovation from the perspective of workers in primary healthcare (PHC). This was a sequential exploratory mixed-methods study (QUAN → qual) in municipalities in the interior of São Paulo state, Brazil, drawing on Diffusion of Innovation Theory. The quantitative component was analytical cross-sectional, applying a validated questionnaire to 114 PHC workers. The model was tested by applying partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) using SmartPLS 2.3.0. The qualitative study was descriptive-exploratory, using interviews (n = 10) with thematic content analysis, aimed at understanding the attributes that did not influence the adoption and use of PHC e-SUS. The attributes 'experimentation', 'ease of use', 'relative advantage', and 'compatibility' did not display statistical significance, indicating that they were not determinant attributes for the adoption and use of PHC e-SUS. Integration of the data evidenced failures in connectivity; lack of time to feed the system in real time and training; lack of prior experimentation; abrupt presentation of the system; and lack of skill with the technology. The results can assist other municipalities in Brazil with the implementation of the PHC e-SUS in relation to the importance of the organizational infrastructure, as well as training in the technology's use and handling. The study contributes to reflections and proposals for interventions in the problems faced in daily work with the adoption and use of a technological innovation such as the PHC e-SUS.
