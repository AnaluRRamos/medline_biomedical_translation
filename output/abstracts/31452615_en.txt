Superior labral tear from anterior to posterior (SLAP) is the most common disease in overhead sports practice. to evaluate the functional outcome after tenodesis of long head biceps tendon (LHBT) in high-performance patients with isolated SLAP lesion refractory to conservative treatment.

The results favor the surgical treatment of these athletes with SLAP IV. <b><i>Level of Evidence IV, SÃ©rie de Casos.</i></b>
