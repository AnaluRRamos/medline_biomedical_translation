The scope of this article is to analyze the meanings constructed by adolescents living in Mar√©, in the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro, based on their access to journalistic coverage on health care and risk, available on different technological platforms and social media. The discussion stems from more comprehensive qualitative research, supported by two theoretical axes: the discursive construction of the concept of health risk in contemporary times; and the role of journalism as a prominent actor in the production and circulation of information and its approach on the subject. The main empirical research resource was discussion groups with teenagers aged between 14 and 16. This technique seeks to observe the interactive and discursive processes of the research participants. The analysis of the materials, among other findings, shows that: a) the presence of journalism in the daily lives of these young people is not without criticism of its modus operandi, irrespective of the reliability of each specific vehicle; b) the criticism extends to other actors used as sources of the articles/reports, especially when addressing issues related to conditions of social vulnerability; c) the repetition of warnings about health risks in the news has considerable potential for excess coverage and burnout.
