Although the main initial deficit is considered to be in the memory domain, an early impairment of executive functions is also found in AD where these deficits are correlated to functional impairment. Ecological tests are more indicated to evaluate executive impairment, and are better able to assist in treating AD patients than more commonly used tests. The aim of this preliminary study is to verify the performance in executive functions using the Behavioural Assessment of the Dysexecutive Syndrome (BADS) in elder controls and mild AD patients, and to analyze its applicability in our environment. The BADS was performed by 17 healthy elders and 17 early AD patients matched for age, schooling and gender. There were significant differences among controls and AD patients on MMSE scores, and in measures of executive functions, memory, and motor speed. Some sub items of BADS (rule shift cards, modified six elements, total score, standard, standard by age and overall classification by age) were also different between groups. Differences were also significant on the Dysexecutive Questionnaire (DEX) of BADS self-ratings and other-ratings. BADS was efficacious in detecting executive deficits in this sample, as confirmed by other executive functions tests applied.
