Placenta accreta spectrum disorders are among the leading causes of maternal morbidity and mortality and their prevalence is likely to increase in the future. The risk of placenta accreta spectrum disorders is highest in cases of placenta previa overlying a previous cesarean section scar. Few studies have evaluated placenta accreta spectrum disorders in Portugal. The aim of this study was to review the cases of placenta accreta spectrum overlying a cesarean section scar managed in a Portuguese tertiary center over the last decade. Retrospective, cross-sectional study, with data collected from hospital databases. Only cases with histopathological confirmation of placenta accreta spectrum were included. During the study period, 15 cases of placenta accreta spectrum overlying a cesarean section scar were diagnosed (prevalence 0.6/1000). All cases were diagnosed antenatally. A transverse cesarean section was present in all cases; 13 were managed by a scheduled multidisciplinary approach, while two required emergent management. Total or subtotal hysterectomy was performed in 12 cases. There were no cases of maternal or neonatal death. Histopathological evaluation confirmed nine cases of placenta accreta, three cases of placenta increta and three cases of placenta percreta. Early antenatal diagnosis is important for a programmed multidisciplinary management of these cases, which may reduce potential morbidity and mortality and ensure better obstetric outcomes. This case series of placenta accreta spectrum overlying a cesarean section scar reports the reality of a tertiary-care perinatal center in Portugal, in which no maternal or neonatal mortality due to placenta accreta spectrum was registered over the last decade; this may be attributed to prenatal diagnosis and a coordinated multidisciplinary team approach.
