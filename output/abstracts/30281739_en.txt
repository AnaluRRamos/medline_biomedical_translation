The scope of this article is to analyze the quality of work life of the physical therapy course teachers in the city of Goiânia in the state of Goiás. It involved a cross-sectional study of 65 physical therapy teachers in Goiânia. The participants who had worked for less than six months in the profession and those who failed to fill out the questionnaire in full were excluded from the research. A socio-demographic and the Total Quality of Work Life (TQWL-42) questionnaire were used to assess the quality of work life. It was established that the teachers who taught in graduate courses and who held management positions presented significantly better averages than those who only taught in undergraduate courses. Satisfaction with income and with the teaching activity also showed significant results influencing the quality of work life of the participants. Work in positions and locations that allow greater autonomy, status and remuneration, as well as subjective evaluation of satisfaction with income and teaching work, influenced the quality of work life of physical therapy teachers.
