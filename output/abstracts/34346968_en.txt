To understand the meanings and perspectives attributed by men to the period lived in the Covid-19 pandemic. Qualitative study structured on the concepts of phenomenology, based on Heidegger's ontic interpretation, carried out with 400 men residing in Brazil. Data was produced through a form made available online. The responses were processed in the NVIVO12 software and analyzed according to the Discourse of the Collective Subject. Two units of analytical meanings revealed in discourse-synthesis emerged. These units were supported by central ideas and ordered in five subunits that represent the collectivity of the investigated phenomenon. The units are: Being and being-in-the-world in the context of the pandemic - experiencing its possibilities and The vigor of the past and the present are presented as possibilities for a new future in the face of the pandemic. The meanings and perspectives revealed a being-there in the context of the pandemic based on themselves, with changes in the routine and feelings and willingness to new possibilities and transformations, which generated psychosocial impact and coping and care strategies in the period of the pandemic. As implications, it is necessary to have a new understanding of the man-being, as they demonstrate the need for care, and for a care that goes beyond physical health.
