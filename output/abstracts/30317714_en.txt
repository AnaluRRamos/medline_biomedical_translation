Patients with cardiac pathology alone are already complex, when this is associated with oncologic pathology, or it's mere suspicion, the patient becomes even more complex. We present a clinical case of a patient with severe aortic stenosis with suspected cancer disease, whose diagnostic study could not be performed due to the patient's clinical condition. The option to intervene surgically was widely debated, never being a consensus among surgeons. There are many doubts about a clinical case of this type, and it is not easy to make a decision to operate. In case of doubt, the decision must always be in favor of the patient: in dubio pro malum.
