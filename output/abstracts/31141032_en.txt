Our objective is to describe the long biceps tendon transfer technique for the treatment of shoulder anterior instability. In this procedure, the long tendon of the biceps brachii is detached from the supraglenoid tubercle and transferred to the anterior edge of the glenoid cavity through a subscapularis tenotomy, reproducing the sling effect and increasing the anterior block. The technique is easy to perform and minimizes the risks of the coracoid process transfer. In conclusion, the transfer of the long tendon of the biceps brachii is an option for the treatment of glenohumeral instability.
