To estimate the prevalence of the Pap test and analyze the factors associated with its non-attendance by Brazilian women. Cross-sectional, population-based study in which were used Vigitel (Surveillance System for Protective and Risk Factors for Chronic Diseases by Telephone Survey ) data and were included women in the target age range of the screening. The coverage and prevalence of non-screening were assessed according to sociodemographic, behavioral and health characteristics. Data from 22,580 women were included. About 17.1% of women did not take the Pap test in the three previous years. Women in the age groups of 35-44, 45-54 and 55-64 years showed a higher prevalence of having the test compared to those aged 25-34 years (p<0.05). The following factors were associated with the non-attendance: women with less than 12 years of study (p<0.05), who declared not having a partner (p<0.0001), residents of Northeast, Midwest and North regions (p<0.05), malnourished (p=0.017), who self-assessed their health as negative and presented at least one negative health behavior (p<0.0001). Despite the high coverage of this screening, it remains unsatisfactory in population subgroups, such as women living without a partner, with low educational level, malnourished, who self-assessed their health status as negative, and with at least one negative health behavior.
