The overuse injuries in the hip joint occur commonly in sports practitioners and currently due to technical advances in diagnostic imaging, especially magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are often misdiagnosed. Recently, a group of people were reported, all female, with pain and swelling in the pelvic region. T2-weighted MRI showed increased signal in the enthesis of the iliotibial band (ITB) along the lower border of the iliac tubercle. We report a case of a 34 year old woman, non-professional runner, with pain at the iliac crest with no history of trauma and whose MRI was compatible with the proximal iliotibial band syndrome.
