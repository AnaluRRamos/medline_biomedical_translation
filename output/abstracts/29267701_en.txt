Right to health intertwines with right to the city: guaranteed access to healthy urban spaces reduces inequities among the population, so that disadvantaged groups can also enjoy positive urbanization effects. In this sense, interconnection between right to the city and right to health promotes equity. This article seeks to explore the interconnection between right to the city and right to health on the basis of an integrative review guided by the question 'What knowledge about right to the city and right to health has been produced in the light of equity?' For this purpose, we analyzed evidence available in the literature indexed in PubMed/Medline, Lilacs, and SciELO between 1986 and 2016. Over this three-decade span, we identified the presence of different degrees of right to the city and right to health in the formulation of policies and in social movement agendas. Formulations regarding population growth moved away from the rights agenda, but in a later phase of democratic consolidation, the fight for rights to health re-emerged. In a third moment of the political visibility of excluded geographical spaces and multiple identity agendas, the struggle to ensure everyone's right to the city came on strong in the game.
