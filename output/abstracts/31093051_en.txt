This work had two objectives: (1) to identify the extent of the problem and gaps pertaining to hypertension control in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) and (2) to identify the potential role for late-stage (T4) translation research to tackle the current and future hypertension burden in that region. We explored the extent of the problem and the potential opportunities to use late-stage (T4) translation research to address it. We analyzed calls to action and policies implemented within several LAC countries and also at the regional level. Some LAC countries are currently developing comprehensive plans for controlling noncommunicable diseases. Additionally, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) is working on implementing a comprehensive plan of action within the PAHO Strategy for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases. These endeavors underscore the need for and the relevance of implementing effective, evidence-based, affordable interventions for treating and controlling hypertension. In these efforts, late-stage (T4) translation research can help to determine the best strategies for delivery of hypertension control. This late-stage (T4) translation research should involve all relevant stakeholders and partners in order to best enhance and scale up appropriate, affordable, and sustainable public health interventions.
