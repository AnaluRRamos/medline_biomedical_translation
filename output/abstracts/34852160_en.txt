To describe incidents related to healthcare services reported by Brazilian citizens on the Health Surveillance Notification System. This was a descriptive study, using the database from the Health Surveillance Notification System (Notivisa) of the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (Anvisa), 'citizen' module, between 2014 and 2018. 935 incidents were reported, most of them occurred among females (60.9%), the elderly (20.1%) and those of white race/skin color (51.0%). The majority of the reported incidents were related to the use of medications (50.8%), falls (7.5%) and healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) (7.2%), which occurred during provision of healthcare, treatment or surgery (37.3%), in daytime (58.3%) and in hospital setting (37.4%). It could be seen a low adherence to the notification system among the citizens. There was a higher frequency of incidents related to medications, falls and HAIs. This shows that citizens have the capability to recognize and report these incidents as patient safety issues.
