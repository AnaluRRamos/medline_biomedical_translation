It has been demonstrated recently that immunoglobulin (Ig)E specific for cross-reactive carbohydrate determinants (CCD) is present in the serum of allergen-sensitized dogs and cats, and that these CCD-specific antibodies might confound serological testing. The objective was to document the prevalence of CCD detectable in a monoclonal cocktail-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay designed for the detection of allergen-specific IgE in the sera of dogs and cats, and to define a means for successful inhibition of these CCD. The incidence of reactivity to bromelain and a commercially available inhibitor of carbohydrate-specific antibodies (RIDA-CCD) was evaluated in 100 dog sera samples before and after inhibition with RIDA-CCD and a proprietary inhibitor containing carbohydrates derived from bromelain (BROM-CCD). Subsequently, sera from 600 dogs and 600 cats were evaluated using a serum diluent with and without BROM-CCD. Both the RIDA-CCD and BROM-CCD inhibitors demonstrated successful reduction of CCD reactivity, although a more efficient profile of inhibition was evident with BROM-CCD. Mite reactivity in dog and cat sera was largely unaffected; however, substantial inhibition for pollen allergens (trees, grasses and weeds) was shown. After BROM-CCD inhibition, 1% of canine samples and 13% of feline samples were rendered completely negative for allergen reactivity. The results demonstrate that BROM-CCD is effective in reducing reactions with irrelevant carbohydrates, and that inhibition of CCD reactivity might substantially alter the outcome of the in vitro reactivity profile used for selection of allergens to be included in an immunotherapeutic regime.
