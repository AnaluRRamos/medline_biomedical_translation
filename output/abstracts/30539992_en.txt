The scope of this study was to analyze the hygienic-sanitary conditions in nine School Food and Nutrition Units (UANE) of a municipality in the state of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil). A Best Practices in School Food Checklist proposed and validated by Stedefeldt et al., containing items scored and grouped into six thematic blocks (BT) was applied. The total score (P) results per BT and the final score (PF) were obtained using the Best Practices in School Food softwareÂ®. The P results in UANE were compared with the classification of Collegiate Board Resolution No. 275 of 2002 of the National Health Surveillance Agency2 and PF results were used for UANE classification. All the UANE results were partially suitable for BT building. For BT handlers, processes/procedures, environmental hygiene and equipment for controlled temperature, most had partially adequate and inadequate results. Most UANE were adequate for BT reception. The PF results classified most UANE (66.7%) as standard health risks, indicating the need for corrective measures for Best Practices in UANE and the supply of safe and healthy meals to schoolchildren.
