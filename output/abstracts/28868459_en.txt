There is a recognized increase of lifelong surgery risk in Crohn disease (CD). Outcome data concerning surgery in children, particularly in the biological era, are limited. To characterize the clinical profile and the clinical outcome in children and adolescents with CD who underwent surgical intervention, in a single tertiary referral center. Retrospective, cross-sectional study, including pediatric patients with CD undergoing intra-abdominal surgery in the last 11 years. Included eight of 50 CD total patients (16%); six female; median age at CD diagnosis of 12.0 years; Paris classification: (a) location: ileocolonic (5), colonic (1), upper disease (1), ileocolonic/upper disease (1); (b) behavior: stricturing (4), nonstricturing nonpenetrating (2), penetrating (1), both penetrating and stricturing disease (1); growth delay (2). Six children received thiopurines, five mesalazine, three corticosteroids and four anti-TNF therapy, preoperatively. Surgery followed diagnosis by a median of 2.9 years. Median PCDAI at the time of surgery was 35.0. Elective surgery was performed in six patients and emergency surgery in two, without major complications. Five children received anti-TNF and three thiopurines post-operatively. Within the follow-up period (median 1.7 years), relapse occurred in one child (3.2 years after intervention); the remaining seven patients persist in clinical remission. Median PCDAI in the last evaluation was 6.3. Weight and height recovery was observed in seven patients, at last follow-up. Surgical treatment of CD is a valid alternative in selected cases, contributing to the resolution of acute complications and maintenance of remission, allowing disease-free interval and nutritional recovery.
