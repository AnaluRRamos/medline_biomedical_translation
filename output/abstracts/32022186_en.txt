The aim of this paper is to identify eating patterns of children aged 6, 9 and 12 months and their association with socioeconomic, behavioral, birth and nutrition variables. Cross-sectional study with children from a cohort in Vi√ßosa-MG, with 112 children at 6 months, 149 at 9 months and 117 at 12 months. Food intake was assessed by a 24-hour recall and patterns extracted by cluster analysis. Breast milk was identified in at least one dietary pattern every month. There was a low participation of ultra-processed foods in the identified dietary patterns. At month 6, children with lower family income were less likely to belong to the dietary pattern composed of milk formulas. Already overweight/obesity was 3.69 times higher in children who made up the pattern 2 (dairy formulas, vegetables, vegetables, beef and pear). At 12 months height deficit (PR = 3.28) and bottle use (PR = 4.51) were associated with the dietary pattern composed of milk formulas and cow's milk. The dietary patterns identified reflected the important participation of breast milk in children's diets. Dietary patterns with the presence of other types of milk were associated with nutritional deviations and bottle feeding.
