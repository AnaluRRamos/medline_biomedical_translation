The aim was to report on a rare case of osteochondroma of the left ischium, which evolved with compression of the sciatic nerve, thus causing sciatic pain in the homolateral lower limb. The patient was female and presented sciatic pain that was treated clinically for one year. However, the pain evolved with increasing intensity and worsened with hip movement. This was associated with diminished motor force and paresthesia of the homolateral lower limb. Radiological investigation of the region showed a bone lesion in the external portion of the left ischium, in the path of the sciatic nerve. Tomographic reconstruction showed cortical continuity with the bone of origin, i.e., a pattern characteristic of osteochondroma. En-bloc resection of the lesion was performed using the Kocher-Langerbeck route, and the anatomopathological analysis proved that it was an osteochondroma. The patient's neurological symptoms improved and, after two months of follow-up, she remained asymptomatic and without any signs of recurrence. Since osteochondroma is the commonest benign bone tumor, it should be taken into consideration in the diagnostic investigation of compressive tumor lesions that could affect the sciatic nerve.
