To establish an overview of computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous nephrostomy performed at a referral center for cancer, addressing the characteristics of patients submitted to this intervention, as well as the indications for it, the technical specificities of it, and its main complications. This was a retrospective study involving a review of the electronic medical records and images of patients submitted to CT-guided percutaneous nephrostomy at a referral center for cancer between 2014 and 2016. A total of 201 procedures were evaluated. In most cases, the obstruction was caused by a malignant neoplasm. Complications occurred in 9.5% of the cases, and an additional intervention was required (typically for catheter repositioning) in 36.6%. Post-procedure complications were not found to be significantly associated with the type of previous cancer treatment, the technique used, the caliber of the drain used in the procedure, or the degree of dilatation of the collection system prior to the procedure. In cancer patients, CT-guided percutaneous nephrostomy is an effective treatment, with success rates and complication rates similar to those reported in the general population.
