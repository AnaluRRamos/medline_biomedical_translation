Bouveret's syndrome is a rare cause of gastric outlet obstruction. We report a case of a 68-year-old woman admitted with upper digestive obstruction. A few months later, and after several diagnostic tests and clinical surveillance, a cholecystoduodenal fistula was suspected. During exploratory laparotomy, the diagnosis of Bouveret's syndrome was confirmed and a pyelolithotomy, pyloroplasty and a cholecystectomy were performed. The patient was asymptomatic 7 months after the operation. This syndrome represents only 1% - 3% of all cases of gallstone ileus, being more frequent in women and in the elderly. The presentation is quite nonspecific, but in most cases the symptomatology suggests an upper digestive occlusion. Treatment can be achieved by lithotripsy, but most patients require a surgical approach.
