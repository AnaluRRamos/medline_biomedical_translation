to evaluate the risk factors for the presence of non-sentinel axillary metastatic disease in patients with breast cancer and positive sentinel node biopsy. Methods: retrospective cross-sectional study of women with breast cancer operated at the Cancer Institute of CearÃ¡ between 2002 and 2012 and submitted to sentinel lymph node biopsy. Among 946 breast cancer patients, 331 underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy, which was positive in 83. These patients underwent axillary lymphadenectomy and 39 (46%) had metastases in other axillary lymph nodes. The variables that were significant for additional axillary disease included Ki67>14 (p=0.043), angiolymphatic invasion (p=0.01) and tumor size (p=0.027). No association was observed with estrogen, progesterone, tumor grade and Her-2 receptors. the presence of angiolymphatic invasion and tumor size have also been related to additional axillary metastasis in other studies. In addition to these variables, the same predictive effect was observed when we evaluated Ki67. The validation of these results may allow the customization of breast cancer treatment, which may reduce its morbidity. angiolymphatic invasion, tumor size (T3/T4) and Ki67>14 were factors predictive of axillary metastasis involvement in addition to the sentinel lymph node.
