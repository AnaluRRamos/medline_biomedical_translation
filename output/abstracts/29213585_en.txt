To study the integrity of the corpus callosum in Binswanger's disease (BD) patients using quantitative fractional anisotropy (DTI-FA). Controls (12) and patients with BD (12) were included. MR [GE Signa Horizon-1.5T] scans were performed. BD patients presented Fazekas's score=6 and leukoaraiosis extension =75%, as assessed on FLAIR sequence. Standard parameters for DTI-FA acquisition were used. Functool was employed for post-processing, and ROIs placed on the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum on one axial plane at the basal ganglia level. Statistics [ANOVA] for genu and splenium comparison were analyzed. DTI-FA showed reduction of anisotropy in both regions of the corpus callosum, more prominently in anterior (genu) than posterior (splenium) in BD patients versus controls. The reduction of anisotropy reflects loss of integrity of fibers of the studied regions of the corpus callosum. This finding indicates an interruption of the most important inter-hemispheric commissure, and component of neural networks that underlies cognitive, behavioral, motor and sensory integration. The affected genu and splenium, together with damage to other fiber systems that connect the prefrontal and parietal-occipital regions, may manifest clinically as dysfunction of high-level integrative regions linked to the domains of executive and sensory functions, respectively, that can occur in Binswanger's disease.
