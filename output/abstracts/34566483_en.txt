Three-dimensional printing is a technology in expansion in the medical field. It also presents many applications in orthopedics. Our review article aims to describe 3D printing, types of 3D printers, and its use in the orthopedic field. 3D models can be created using tomography scans. Those models can then be manipulated, even simulating surgeries. It is possible to print biomodels, which will help us understand deformities and plan surgeries. Orthopedic surgeons must be updated in these disruptive technologies that may help their daily practice. <b><i>Level of Evidence V, Expert opinion.</i></b>
