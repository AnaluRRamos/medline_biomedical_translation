This study assessed the hospitalization rates from motor vehicle accidents in the Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS) in residents of the city of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, from 2000 to 2019, according to sex, age bracket, and means of transportation (pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists, and motor vehicle occupants). A segmented regression model with negative binomial response was adjusted with inflection points to accommodate possible changes in trends. 189,765 hospitalizations were recorded during the study period, mostly males (80.5%) and from 20 to 49 years of age (71.2%). The most frequent type of accident involved motorcyclists (42.8%), followed by run-over pedestrians (33.7%). In general, the period from 2000 to 2007 was marked by increasing hospitalization rates from motor vehicle accidents involving all means of transportation, in both sexes, and in most age brackets. The year when the rates stopped increasing (or in some cases began to drop) differed according to the means of transportation. For vehicle occupants and cyclists, the trend in most age brackets turned downward in 2008, but the same did not happen with pedestrians and motorcyclists until 2012. Starting in 2015, the decline stopped in pedestrians, and the rates in cyclists turned upward again in most age brackets. For motorcyclists, the rates turned upward again in men 20 to 59 years of age (7.2% per year, exceeding 140 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2019) and in women 15 to 39 years of age (4.9% per year). The benefits of traffic safety measures implemented thus far in Brazil may have reached their limit, so that the current control and prevention measures need to be revised.
