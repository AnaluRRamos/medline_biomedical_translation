The present study aims to investigate the association between <i>caspase-8</i> (<i>CASP8</i>) (rs13416436 and rs2037815) and <i>Fas cell surface death receptor</i> (<i>FAS</i>) (rs3740286 and rs4064) polymorphisms with endometriosis in Brazilian women.  In the present case-control study, 45 women with a diagnosis of endometriosis and 78 normal healthy women as a control group were included. The genotyping was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with Taqman hydrolysis probes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Darmstadt, Germany). Genotypic and allelic frequencies were analyzed using Chi-squared (χ<sup>2</sup>) test. In order to determine the inheritance models and haplotypes ,SNPStats (Institut Català d'Oncologia, Barcelona, Spain) was used. Levels of 5% (<i>p</i> = 0.05) were considered statistically significant.  No significant difference was observed in genotypic or allelic frequencies between control and endometriosis groups for rs13416436 and rs2037815 (<i>CASP8</i> gene). On the other hand, a significant difference between rs3740286 and rs4064 (<i>FAS</i> gene) was found. Regarding polymorphisms in the <i>FAS</i> gene, a statistically significant difference was found in co-dominant and dominant models. Only the haplotype containing the rs3740286A and rs4064G alleles in the <i>FAS</i> gene were statistically significant.  The polymorphisms in the <i>CASP8</i> gene were not associated with endometriosis. The results indicate an association between <i>FAS</i> gene polymorphisms and the risk of developing endometriosis.
