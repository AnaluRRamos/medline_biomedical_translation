Studies related to obesity have shown association with metabolic syndrome. Data showing that obesity is capable to cause low grade chronic inflammation, without its classic signs and symptoms, call attention to researches to study different cells types and the mechanism of the inflammatory process. To evaluate the variation of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL6) in diabetic patients with BMI <35 kg/m2 in the pre and postoperative of partial duodenal switch. Nine patients were studied before and one year after the operation and the variation of the serum IL6 was measured by Elisa. The changes of HbA1c were also registered. The pre-operative IL6 levels reached 65,50436±2,911993 pg/ml and one year after de operation 39,47739±3,410057 and the HbA1c average of 10,67 and 5.8 in the same period. The partial duodenal switch was efficient to control one year after the procedure the chronic inflammatory process caused by the diabetes mellitus type 2 with BMI <35 by dropping the IL6 levels and bringing the HbA1c to normal.
