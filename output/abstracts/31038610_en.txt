Describe the implementation of care transfer flow chart in postoperative, based on a risk classification model. Experience report on the implementation of a pilot project between the post-anesthetic recovery room and the surgical hospitalization unit, developed between December/2016 and March/2017, aimed at transferring s the care of patients with low risk of postoperative mortality, in a university hospital in the South of Brazil. The project made it possible to expedite the discharge of the patient from the Post-Anesthetic Recovery Room to the surgical hospitalization unit, to qualify the records regarding nursing care and to optimize the time of nurses in both units for care activities. The implementation of a care transfer flow chart from the risk classification for postoperative patients contributed to a more effective communication, culminating in improvements in patient safety.
