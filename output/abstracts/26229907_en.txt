To evaluate the incidence of consolidation in surgical treatment of fractures of the lateral extremity of the clavicle using the double subcoracoid ligature technique, with nonabsorbable No. 5 thread. Between May 1993 and June 2013, the Shoulder and Elbow Group of our service surgically treated 116 patients (116 shoulders) with fractures of the lateral extremity of the clavicle. Among these, we were able to reassess 65 cases. The surgical technique used consisted of double subcoracoid ligature with two nonabsorbable threads. In two patients classified as type III, we had to combine this technique with use of an interfragmentary screw for fixation of the intra-articular portion of the acromioclavicular joint. We achieved fracture consolidation in 90%. Fourteen cases (21%) evolved with major complications: four cases of pseudarthrosis, five of adhesive capsulitis, two of delayed consolidation and three of loss of reduction. Two cases (3%) evolved with minor complications of skin granuloma. The double ligature technique for fractures of the lateral extremity of the clavicle promotes the stabilization needed for consolidation to take place, without the need for synthesis using metal components. It avoids reoperation for the synthesis material to be removed. Moreover, it is a low-cost procedure with good reproducibility and preservation of the acromioclavicular joint.
