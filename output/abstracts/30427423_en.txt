The objective of this study was to research the existence of sexism against women among primary healthcare (PHC) workers and to identify associated factors. This was a cross-sectional study in which 163 PHC professionals of both sexes participated, all of whom were aged over 18 and had completed their primary or secondary education. The Gender Stereotyping and Ambivalent Sexism Inventory questionnaires were used. The average scores were more than 50% of the maximum score: Gender Stereotyping - 53.8%, hostile sexism - 58.2%, benevolent sexism - 64.1%. The average scores stratified by sociodemographic variables were higher. Significant differences in the hostile sexism score were found for sex (men scored higher than women), religion (higher scores for evangelical Christians) and among those who drank alcohol. For benevolent sexism, differences were found for schooling (greater scores for those who had only completed their primary education), religion (higher scores for evangelical Christians and Catholics) and area of work (greater for those working in general services). The stratification of the Gender Stereotyping scores did not point to significant differences. Sexist prejudice was found to exist for hostile sexism, benevolent sexism and gender stereotyping. This finding could have a negative influence on the service-user relationship, leading to greater inequities in health as a result of gender inequality.
