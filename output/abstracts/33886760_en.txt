The scope of this paper is to analyze the determinants of satisfaction with the care provided by Basic Health Units (BHU). The data were extracted from the external evaluation microdata of the National Program for Improvement of Access and Quality of Primary Care (PIAQ) for the year 2013. The results revealed that individuals in better financial standing tend to be less satisfied with the care provided by the UBS. In addition to this, evaluating variables such as waiting times for consultation, respect for the patient and the guarantee of privacy, it becomes clear that the improvement in the perception of care provided by the UBS can be achieved with better administration of resources, namely without increasing financial overheads. Lastly, it becomes apparent that individuals value the care provided more than the infrastructure of the UBS when asked to evaluate care.
