Household surveys are one of the primary methodologies used in population-based studies. This narrative review of the literature aims to gather and describe the leading national and international household surveys of relevance. In Brazil, the historical role played by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) in conducting the most relevant research in the production of social data stands out. The Medical-Health Care Survey (AMS) and the National Household Sample Survey (PNAD), with the serial publication of Health Supplements, are the country's primary sources of health information. In 2013, in partnership with the Ministry of Health, IBGE launched the National Health Survey (PNS), the most significant household health survey ever conducted in Brazil. The PNS-2019 received a major thematic and sampling expansion and, for the first time, applied the Primary Care Assessment Tool to assess PHC services in all 27 Brazilian states.
