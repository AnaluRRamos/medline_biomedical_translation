To analyze the influence of surgical myocardial revascularization on early and late mortality in octogenarians and compare the survival rates with age adjusted general population. Between 2007 and 2014, 182 octogenarian patients underwent elective or urgent coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. Logistic regression was performed to evaluate the in-hospital mortality predictors. The comparison of long term survival between our population and age adjusted general population was made using one-sample log-rank test. The in-hospital mortality was 4,4% and its predictors on univariable analysis were non sinus rhythm (p=0,001), acute coronary syndrome less than 7 days prior to surgery (p=0,021), ejection fraction less than 50% (p=0,04) and the need for conversion to on pump surgery (p=0,04). On multivariate logistic regression non sinus rhythm and acute myocardial infarction less than 7 days before surgery were independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. Follow-up at one-year showed survival rate of 86,2% and at five years 58,4%. There was no significant difference in survival rates between the study group and the age adjusted standard population (p=0,96). The group was divided in two groups: (1) complete revascularization and (2) incomplete revascularization. There was no significant difference in survival (p=0,32 and p=0,19, respectively) compared to the age adjusted standard population. Coronary artery bypass grafting in octogenarians is safe and has an important impact on long term survival, with five-year survival being similar to the age adjusted standard population.
