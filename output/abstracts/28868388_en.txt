Pancreatic panniculitis is a rare skin disorder that occurs in 2-3% of pancreatic diseases, mostly associated with acute or chronic pancreatitis. Its pathophysiology is still unclear, but the release of pancreatic enzymes in circulation can be responsible for this disorder. The typical histological features are adipocyte necrosis with neutrophils infiltrate and typical 'ghost cells'. Its treatment, clinical course and prognosis are usually related with the pancreatic disease. We present a case of a 39-year-old man who presented with fever, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting after a copious alcohol ingestion. Acute alcohol-induced pancreatitis was diagnosed. 9 days after admission he developed tender erythematous subcutaneous nodules, whose biopsy was consistent with pancreatic panniculitis. There was clinical and laboratory improvement with supportive treatment as well as skin nodules regression. Although pancreatic panniculitis is a rare condition, physicians must be aware of it to avoid delay in the diagnosis.
