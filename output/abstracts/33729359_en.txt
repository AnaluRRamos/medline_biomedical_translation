The literature does not clearly define the assignments of Community Health Workers (CHW) in the field of oral health. This study aimed to redefine the main assignments of CHW regarding their work processes in oral health in basic health care. A theoretical-logical model based on an official publication from the Brazilian Ministry of Health, with six dimensions of work, was used. The model was built based on the assignments of CHW in Dentistry and sent to 30 experts chosen intentionally for the consensual study, using the Delphi technique. The matrix presented the following dimensions: registration of families, mapping the coverage area, home visits, work with community health education, participation in the community, and intersectoral work. These dimensions were detailed with sub-dimensions and measurable criteria. After the study participants analyzed the dimensions, two criteria were excluded. Fourteen experts concluded the study. The final matrix showed the need for CHW to be trained in several oral health topics. This study provides an objective framework of the work process of CHW in oral health and shows their ability to perform oral health promotion, surveillance, prevention, and education actions.
