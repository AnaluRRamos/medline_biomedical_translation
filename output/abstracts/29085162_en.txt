To assess the role of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in the evaluation of breast lesions classified as suspicious on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), correlating the findings with the results of the histological analysis. This was a retrospective, descriptive study based on a review of the medical records of 215 patients who were submitted to MRI with DWI before undergoing biopsy at a cancer center. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were calculated for each lesion, and the result of the histological analysis was considered the gold standard. The mean age was 49 years. We identified 252 lesions, 161 (63.9%) of which were found to be malignant in the histological analysis. The mean ADC value was higher for the benign lesions than for the malignant lesions (1.50 × 10<sup>-3</sup> mm<sup>2</sup>/s vs. 0.97 × 10<sup>-3</sup> mm<sup>2</sup>/s), the difference being statistically significant (<i>p</i> < 0.001). The ADC cut-off point with the greatest sensitivity and specificity on the receiver operating characteristic curve was 1.03 × 10<sup>-3</sup> mm<sup>2</sup>/s. When the DWI and conventional MRI findings were combined, the accuracy reached 95.9%, with a sensitivity of 95.7% and a specificity of 96.4%. The use of DWI could facilitate the characterization of breast lesions, especially those classified as BI-RADS 4, increasing the specificity and diagnostic accuracy of MRI.
