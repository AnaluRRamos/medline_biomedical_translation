This study aimed to verify the prevalence and socioeconomic and health factors associated with morbidity among community-dwelling elderly. This is an analytical and cross-sectional survey conducted in 2012 with 1,691 elderly from Uberaba-MG. A tool structured for socioeconomic data and self-reported morbidities was used along with the Abbreviated Geriatric Depression, Katz and Lawton-Brody scales. We proceeded to a descriptive analysis and linear regression (p < 0.05). A high percentage (88.3%) of elderly reported two or more morbidities, with higher prevalence for systemic arterial hypertension (61.9%) and back problems (48.6%). Female gender (β = 0.216; p< 0.001), functional disability in basic (β = 0.240; p < 0.001) and instrumental activities of daily living (β = 0.120; p < 0.001) and indicative of depression (β = 0.209; p < 0.001) were associated with the highest number of morbidities. The presence of two or more comorbidities and the association with socioeconomic and health variables show the need for monitoring and control actions of the factors that interfere in the elderly in this condition.
