To characterize and compare the functional aspects of swallowing and clinical markers in intensive care patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) in Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Participants of this study were 113 adults diagnosed with TBI. Data collection stage involved: clinical assessment of the risk for bronchoaspiration performed by a speech-language therapist; assessment of the functional level of swallowing (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association National Outcome Measurement System - ASHA NOMS ); assessment of the patient' health status (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment - SOFA). After the inclusion criteria were applied, patients were grouped according to their swallowing functional level: levels 1 and 2 - ASHA1 (n=25); levels 3, 4 and 5 - ASHA2 (n=37); levels 6 and 7 - ASHA3 (n=51). The statistical analyses indicated the following significant results: the ASHA3 group presented lower severity levels of TBI at the clinical assessment of bronchoaspiration, remained less time intubated (approximately um third less than the more severe group), remained fewer days in hospital and needed less therapy sessions to return to safe oral feeding. The clinical predictor signs for bronchoaspiration that best characterized the groups were the presence of altered auscultation and the presence of coughing after swallowing. Patients in the ASHA3 group presented these signs less frequently. The score obtained on the SOFA and the time of orotracheal intubation were identified as the prognostic indicators of functional swallowing. The presence of altered cervical auscultation and coughing were clinical predictors of dysphagia.
