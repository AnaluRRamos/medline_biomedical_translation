To analyze agreement/discrepancy between body self-image and Body Mass Index (BMI), according to variables related to type of food and environment influence. This was a cross-sectional analysis of 195 prepubescent children (â‰¥5 years), attending a Primary Health Care service in Manguinhos, Rio de Janeiro. Z-scores were applied to classify BMI. Self-image was collected using the figure rating scale (silhouettes) validated for children. A multinomial model was used to estimate covariate association with the underestimated/overestimated BMI outcome in relation to self-image. Overweight children underestimated their BMI, as compared with self-image, more often (58.6%) than obese children (22.0%) and children with adequate BMI (49.0%). This dissociation was correlated to participation in a cash transfer program (OR=2.01 - 95%CI 1.04;3.90) and daily consumption of sugar-sweetened foodstuffs (OR=3.88 - 95%CI 1.05;14.39). Underestimation of BMI among overweight children should be taken into account by Primary Health Care services, in order to enhance intervention practices.
