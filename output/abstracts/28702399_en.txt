Simultaneous bilateral neck femur fracture is a rare entity that has been associated with underlying bone disease, various metabolic diseases, high-energy trauma, and seizure disorders. Its occurrence following minimal trauma is very rare. This article presents the case of a 66-year-old female who sustained bilateral intracapsular fracture neck femur following a slip and fall at home. Single-stage bilateral cemented total hip replacement was done using a direct lateral approach with alternate right and left lateral positions. The authors report a satisfactory outcome, with Harris hip score of 98 at one year, which persisted until her last follow-up at 30 months.
