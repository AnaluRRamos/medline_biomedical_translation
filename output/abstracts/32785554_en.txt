Challenges remain to ensure access to diagnosis and treatment ten years into continuous cancer prevention, control, and oral health policies. This study aims to analyze the oncology and oral health policies in force regarding the process of implanting oral cancer-related care components. Ten policies were analyzed under the lenses of the Structuration Theory, besides data on the supply of services between 2002 and 2017. Low coverage and inadequate regional distribution were highlighted in primary and secondary health care levels, despite increased funding and number of services. Unequal distribution of performed surgeries was identified in tertiary care. The limitation of home care services has hindered users' access to palliative care. A convergence was identified between the analyzed policies and concern with the regulation of authoritative resources and the increase of allocative resources, which stirred the expansion of services. Investments should be made in the expansion, regionalization, and universalization of services. A possible setback in these policies could aggravate the situation and contribute to the increase in health inequalities.
