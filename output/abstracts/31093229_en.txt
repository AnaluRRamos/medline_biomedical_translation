Identify factors related to behavioral changes in smokers over 18 years of age following implementation of provincial policies for 100% smoke-free spaces in Argentina. A cross-sectional analytical study was conducted. The multilevel technique was used with data from different hierarchies. Secondary data sources were used: National Risk Factor Surveys 2005, 2009, and 2013. The individual analysis of explanatory variables revealed that residents of provinces that do not have smoke-free legislation were 40% less likely to consider quitting smoking than people who live in provinces with such legislation. In provinces without smoke-free spaces, males over 65 years old are even less likely to think about quitting smoking. The results suggest that legislation based on Article 8 of the Framework Convention would be effective in promoting tobacco cessation in Argentina.
