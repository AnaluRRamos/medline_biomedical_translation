The non-fluent and agrammatic variant of Primary Progressive Aphasia (NFPPA) is characterized by reduced verbal production with deficits in building grammatically correct sentences, involving dysfunctions in syntactic and morphological levels of language. There are a growing number of studies about non-pharmacological alternatives focusing on the rehabilitation of functional aspects or specific cognitive impairments of each variant of PPA. This study reports a short-term treatment administered to a patient with NFPPA focusing on the production of sentences. The patient had significant reduction in verbal fluency, use of keywords, phrasal and grammatical simplifying as well as anomia. Using the method of errorless learning, six sessions were structured to stimulate the formation of sentences in the present and past with the cloze technique. The patient had improvement restricted to the strategy, with 100% accuracy on the trained phrases and generalization to untrained similar syntactic structure after training. These results persisted one month after the treatment.
