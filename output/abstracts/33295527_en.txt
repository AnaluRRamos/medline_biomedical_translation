To identify the factors related to the work process regarding the adherence of Primary Healthcare teams to the rapid test for HIV, syphilis, hepatitis B and C during prenatal care and administration of benzathine penicillin in primary healthcare. A descriptive, exploratory and quantitative study conducted between the months of July and November 2018, with professionals from the Family Health Strategy teams of the Serid√≥ Norte-Rio-Grandense region in Rio Grande do Norte State, Brazil. There were 18 municipalities, 94 Basic Health Units and 100 Family Health Strategy teams which participated in the study. The nurse was the main person involved in the testing service, and 93% of the interviewed teams offered the test in the service routine. Of these teams, 97.8% underwent prenatal testing, 51.6% offered the test to the pregnant woman at the beginning of the third trimester, and 57% offered the rapid test to sexual partners. Benzantine penicillin was available in 87.1% of the teams; however, 49.5% did not administer the medication in primary healthcare. The testing process proved to be fragile because even if the test was available in prenatal care, the other activities linked to the work process did not occur properly.
