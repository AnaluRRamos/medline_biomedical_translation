to identify the main intraoperative complications of patients who underwent keratoplasty and relationship between these complications and clinical and surgical factors. cross-sectional observational study. A census of the patients submitted to keratoplasty was carried out, which totaled 258 procedures. twenty-two intraoperative complications were recorded, all in penetrating keratoplasty surgeries, of which 59.09% were performed in male patients with a mean age of 58.5 years. The main intraoperative complication was vitreous loss (36.36%). A statistically significant relationship was found between the variable 'intraoperative complication' and the variables 'previous surgery', 'combined keratoplasty and cataract extraction' and 'corneal host button greater than 8.0 mm'. identifying the main intraoperative complications of keratoplasty enables nurses to understand which factors may interfere with these procedures, point out possible predictors of complications, and seek control measures so that such complications do not occur.
