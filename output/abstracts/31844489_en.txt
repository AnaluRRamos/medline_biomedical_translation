The impairments in cognitive functions such as memory, executive function, visuospatial skills and language in Parkinson's disease (PD) are drawing increasing attention in the current literature. Studies dedicated to investigating the relationship between subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) and cognitive functioning are contradictory. This systematic review aims to analyze the impact on the cognitive functioning of patients with PD and STN-DBS. Articles published in the 2007-2017 period were retrieved from the Medline/Pubmed databases using PRISMA criteria. The analysis of 27 articles revealed many conflicting results, precluding a consensus on a cognitive functioning standard and hampering the establishment of a neuropsychological profile for PD patients who underwent STN-DBS surgery. Further studies investigating this relationship are needed.
