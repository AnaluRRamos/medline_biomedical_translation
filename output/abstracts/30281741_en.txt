ICD-10 is the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), a medical classification list by the World Health Organization. It contains codes for diseases, signs and symptoms, abnormal findings, complaints, social circumstances, and external causes of injury or diseases. Associations between variables were evaluated using Pearson's chi-squared test and multiple correspondence analysis. Six hundred and ninety-one (691) codes were identified related to adverse drug reactions (52.1%) and drug poisoning (47.9%). A total of 687 (99.4%) and 511 (73.9%) codes were validated in 1st and 2nd validation, respectively. There were statistically significant differences (p <0.05) between adverse reactions and drug poisoning in the variables used to characterize the reference list. The association between drug and hospital admission and death was statistically significant when stratified by type of adverse event (p <0.001). Three groupings of codes were identified in multiple correspondence analysis where there are associations between categories of response assessed. The reference list can be a useful tool in pharmacovigilance actions in Brazil.
