To evaluate, compare and identify the surgical technique with best results for treating intra-articular calcaneal fractures, taking into account postoperative outcomes, complications and scoring in the Aofas questionnaire. This was a retrospective study on 54 patients with fractures of the calcaneus who underwent surgery between 2002 and 2012 by means of the following techniques: (1) open reduction with extended L-shaped lateral incision and fixation with double-H plate of 3.5Â mm; (2) open reduction with minimal incision lateral approach and percutaneous fixation with wires and screws; and (3) open reduction with minimal incision lateral approach and fixation with adjustable monoplanar external fixator. Patients treated using a lateral approach, with fixation using a plate had a mean Aofas score of 76 points; those treated through a minimal incision lateral approach with screw and wire fixation had a mean score of 71 points; and those treated through a minimal incision lateral approach with an external fixator had a mean score of 75 points. The three surgical techniques were shown to be effective for treating intra-articular calcaneal fractures, without any evidence that any of the techniques being superior. Intra-articular calcaneal fractures are complex and their treatment should be individualized based on patient characteristics, type of fracture and the surgeon's experience with the surgical technique chosen.
