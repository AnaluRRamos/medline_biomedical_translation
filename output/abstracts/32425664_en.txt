To compare clinical and radiologic results and complications of patients who underwent arthrodesis using a transfibular approach with either a cannulated screw or an anterior fusion plate. Patients who underwent ankle arthrodesis were divided into two groups according to the used materials: 6.5 mm cannulated screw (A) and anterior fusion plate (B). The clinical scores were compared between groups. The radiologic results were then assessed by union time. The results were statistically analyzed using SPSS 20. There was no significant difference between both groups in the American Orthopedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) score (<i>p</i> = 0.75), and in the visual analog scale (<i>p</i> = 0.42). In group B, two cases included wound infection at the surgical site. In tt A, the mean union time was 10.5 ± 2.3 weeks. In group B, it was 7.8 ± 1.3. There was a statistically significant difference (<i>p</i> = 0.007) between union time in both groups. Anterior fusion plate is an effective method for shorter union time, but the surgeon should be careful with the surgical wound at the skin incision site in the lesion of the distal tibia. <i>Level of Evidence III, Retrospective comparative study.</i>
