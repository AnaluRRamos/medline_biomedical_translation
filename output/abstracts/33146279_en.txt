The presence of multimorbidity patterns has been related to functional disability in basic activities (BADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), which are essential for elder individuals' self-care and autonomy. The study thus aimed to estimate the association between multimorbidity patterns and presence of functional disability in elderly Brazilians. This was a cross-sectional study using data from the Brazilian National Health Survey (PNS 2013) in a sample of elderly Brazilians (â‰¥ 60 years). The measures of functional disability were from self-completed questionnaires, categorized in basic activities of daily living (BADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). The multimorbidity patterns analyzed here were: (1) cardiorespiratory; (2) vascular-metabolic; and (3) mental-musculoskeletal. The adjustment variables included age, sex, schooling, and region of Brazil. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed, estimating crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR) with Stata 16.0. Elderly individuals classified in the mental-musculoskeletal patterns showed the highest odds of disability in BADLs (OR = 2.72; 95%CI: 2.33; 3.18), while those with the cardiopulmonary pattern showed the highest odds of disability in IADLs (OR = 2.65; 95%CI: 1.95; 3.60), compared to those without the same patterns. All the multimorbidity patterns analyzed here were associated with disability in BADLs and IADLs and should thus be considered when planning measures to prevent disabilities in elderly individuals with multimorbidity.
