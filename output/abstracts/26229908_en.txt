To present the results from early diagnosis and delayed surgical treatment of a cohort of patients who were diagnosed with Morel-Lavallée lesions. Between January 2006 and December 2013, we performed delayed surgical debridement on Morel-Lavallée lesions, after delimitation of the local tissue necrosis, followed by closure through second intention and/or use of grafts/flaps. All the patients evolved with complete closure of the lesion after the delayed debridement, granulation of the operative wound and primary suturing or construction of pedunculated flaps. Three patients (50%) evolved with deep infectious processes due to the successive operative procedures. Whatever the treatment methods used are, they should be performed in a radical manner. If not, the patient will be at risk of evolution to septicemia and death.
