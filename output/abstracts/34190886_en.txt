The aim of this study was to study the association between pregnancy-related anxiety in women, screened during the third trimester, and companionship during their hospitalization. A case-control study was conducted in which 80 pregnant women over the age of 18 years, at 28 weeks and beyond, and without any diagnosed physical and/or health conditions took part. They were divided into 20 cases and 60 controls. Anxiety was measured using State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and specific variables were recorded. A descriptive bivariate analysis was performed to compare the chosen variables by means of the chi-squared, Kruskal-Wallis H and Mann-Whitney U tests. Companionship was associated with a reduction in state and trait anxiety ( p = 0.038 in both dimensions) during hospitalization. Women of the Roma (Gitano) ethnicity developed the most anxiety ( p = 0.019) and primiparous women were at four times greater risk. The absence of support from a person of trust during hospitalization, together with ethnicity and primiparity, contributed to increased symptoms of anxiety in pregnant women hospitalized during their third trimester. Therefore, involvement by their close social circle is essential for the prevention and/or reduction of anxiety in this population.
