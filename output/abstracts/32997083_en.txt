To evaluate the factors associated with food insecurity in families living in the urban area of Tocantins/Brazil. This is a population-based cross-sectional study conducted in the urban area of 22 municipalities in the 8 microregions of the state. A semi-structured questionnaire was applied to the head of household to obtain socioeconomic and demographic data, and the Brazilian Food Insecurity Scale (EBIA) was used to assess food insecurity at home. The anthropometric assessment of the residents was made by measuring weight, height/length and waist circumference. Multinomial logistic regression was performed to assess the association of food insecurity with individual/household variables, and Pearson's chi-square test was used to compare whether there was a difference in the prevalence of food insecurity between microregions and between families with and without individuals under 18 years. A total of 596 households were evaluated, of which 63.4% were in a food insecurity situation. The final model of the multivariate analysis showed that low head-of-household schooling, low per capita income, receiving social assistance benefits and lack of clean drinking water in the household were associated with food insecurity (p < 0.05). The findings of this study reveal the high prevalence of food insecurity in the families studied and their associated factors, showing the need for local actions and public policies to improve health conditions, education and income of the population, and consequently, improve the scenario of food and nutritional insecurity in the state.
