Most tumors of the biliary tract are too small to have specific imaging characteristics or for percutaneous puncture to provide sufficient material for diagnosis. Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage, in addition to being a well-established technique in the treatment of obstructive jaundice, provides adequate access for sampling obstructive lesions. In cases of biliary lesions, percutaneous transhepatic biopsy of the biliary tract has proven to be a useful diagnostic technique, with a reported accuracy of over 90% at some referral centers.
