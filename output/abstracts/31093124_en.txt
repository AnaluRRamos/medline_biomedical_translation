To examine the association between unintended pregnancy and inadequate rotavirus immunization in Peruvian children. Utilizing cross-sectional observational data from the 2012 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), logistic regression analysis was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between unintended pregnancy and inadequate rotavirus immunization among children. Of 9 620 pregnancies in the five years preceding the survey, 5 396 of them (56.1%) were reported as unintended, of which 2 981 were mistimed (30.9%) and 2 415 (25.1%) were unwanted. A total of 5 187 children (54.9%; 95% CI = 53.8%-56.1%) were recorded to have inadequate rotavirus immunization. Maternal literacy status was found to be a significant effect modifier of the association between pregnancy intention and rotavirus immunization (P value = 0.006). Among children born to illiterate mothers, unintended pregnancy was significantly associated with increased odds of inadequate rotavirus immunization (aOR = 2.6; 95% CI = 1.2-4.4), as compared to children from intended pregnancies. Deficient rotavirus immunization was significantly predicted by inadequate polio, pneumococcal, and influenza vaccinations; having a television in the household; and less maternal education. In contrast, having received breast-feeding education was protective against inadequate rotavirus immunization. Among literate mothers, there was no association between pregnancy intention and rotavirus immunization. Our study provides evidence that improving literacy among mothers could increase rotavirus vaccination uptake among children from unintended pregnancies.
