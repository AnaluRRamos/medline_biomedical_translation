We aim to describe the construction and validation of the logical model and the matrix of criteria for assessing care to people with mental disorders in conflict with the law. This is a methodological research, carried out from February to December 2019, following three procedures: 1) theoretical - composed of an evaluability study performed from documentary research and interviews with key informants; 2) empirical - construction of the collection instrument and selection of experts for the validation process of the proposed evaluation instrument; and 3) analytical - performing two Delphi steps. The evaluability study resulted in the elaboration and agreement of the logical model; the analysis and comparison between the reality of the policy and the logical model; and the elaboration of the matrix of criteria. The criteria matrix content adequacy was assessed by 16 experts in the Delphi 1 step and 12 experts in the Delphi 2 step, whose content was validated with a Content Validity Coefficient of 0.93. The logical model and the matrix of criteria proposed in this study are expected to direct health professionals, researchers, workers, and other social actors to assess this clientele's care.
