Executive function deficits have been previously documented in individuals with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The current study aimed to compare measures of executive functions among a clinical sample of adults with ADHD and normal control subjects, matched for age, gender and education. Twenty-three self-referred adults diagnosed with ADHD according to DSM-IV criteria, and twenty-five control subjects were assessed using a neuropsychological battery which included the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Tower of Hanoi, Digit Span, Trail Making Test (A and B), Stroop Test and Raven's Progressive Matrices. The ADHD group did not differ significantly from the control subjects on any of the measures assessed. Measures of executive functions using this test battery were unable to discriminate between adults with ADHD and control subjects in this clinical sample.
