There are only two single case reports describing double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE)-assisted endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) of the jejunum. The aim of this case series was to evaluate the feasibility and utility of DBE-assisted EMR in patients with familial and non-familial jejunal polyps. Observational, open-label, retrospective, single-arm case series in two hospitals. Eight patients underwent DBE assisted jejunal EMR. Median age of patients was 42 years (range 24-62 years), male: female ratio 1.5:1. DBE was done through the antegrade (i.e. oral) route in all patients. Four patients had FAP; two had Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, one had a sporadic adenoma and one had a bleeding jejunal polyp, which on histological examination turned out to be lipoma. 3/8 underwent piece-meal EMR. No immediate adverse events occurred. This is the first case series presenting the technical details, feasibility and outcomes of EMR of the small bowel. EMR of the jejunum is feasible and safe during DBE.
