Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune disease characterized by subepidermal blister formation. Can be self-limiting but when necessary treatment includes the use of corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and biological agents. We present the case of a 37 year old patient with a severe and refractory presentation of bullous pemphigoid. After about a month of treatment with various first line drugs and with no response, we chose to start rituximab and clear improvement of the lesions was observed. The authors aim to highlight the usefulness and effectiveness of this drug in this disease.
