Although non-ischemic troponin elevation is frequently seen in patients admitted to the emergency department (ED), consensus regarding its management is lacking. This study aimed to characterize patients admitted to the ED with non-ischemic troponin elevation and to identify potential mortality predictors in this population. This retrospective observational study included ED patients with a positive troponin test result between June and July of 2015. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) were excluded. Data on patient demographics and clinical and laboratory variables were extracted from medical records. Follow-up data were obtained for 16 months or until death occurred. The statistical significance level was 5%. Troponin elevation without ACS was found in 153 ED patients. The median (IQR) patient age was 78 (19) years, 80 (52.3%) were female and 59(38.6%) died during follow-up. The median (IQR) follow-up period was 477(316) days. Survivors were significantly younger 76 (24) vs. 84 (13) years; p=0.004) and featured a higher proportion of isolated troponin elevation (without creatine kinase or myoglobin elevation) in two consecutive evaluations: 48 (53.9%) vs. 8 (17.4%), p<0.001. Survivors also presented a lower rate of antiplatelet treatment and same-day hospitalization. In the multivariate logistic regression with adjustment for significant variables in the univariate analysis, isolated troponin elevation in two consecutive evaluations showed a hazard ratio= 0.43 (95%CI 0.17â€“0.96, p=0.039); hospitalization, previous antiplatelet treatment and age remained independently associated with mortality. Isolated troponin elevation in two consecutive measurements was a strong predictor of survival in ED patients with troponin elevation but without ACS.
