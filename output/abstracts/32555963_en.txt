To compare the nutritional status follow up of patients who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (BGYR) and Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) in hospitals of the private and public health systems, in Pernambuco. This study included patients who underwent bariatric surgery in the public and private health systems, in Pernambuco, from 2008 to 2016. Anthropometric and biochemical (hemoglobin, B12, iron and ferritin) data were evaluated in the preoperative period and at 3, 6 and 12 months after the operation. There were no significant difference between patients seen at the two health systems regarding the levels of hemoglobin, iron, anemia and vitamin B12. Patients who underwent the RYGB, presented with iron deficiency which was significantly lower for those in the private system, but only at the 3 month evaluation. Low levels of ferritin were observed at the 6 month evaluation, and patients in the private health system presented with the highest ferritin deficiency. The rate of surgical success was significantly higher in those patients undergoing the RYGB at the private system. After a 12-month bariatric surgery follow-up, there was no statistically significant difference regarding micronutrient deficiency between patients followed up at the private and public health systems.
