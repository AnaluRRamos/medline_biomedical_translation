To implement one analysis method of the ankle bone contour that could make a more precise ankle arthrodesis. Twenty tomographies were submitted to 3D reconstruction. Seven points of anatomic interest for ankle arthrodesis with the three screws technique were marked with a triplannar marker. The median of the position of markers was estimated, and the union of the seven median points allow the construction of one median ankle for that population. Using this median ankle, sizes and angles for the screws position were determined. Two median ankles were reconstructed, left and right. The position of the screw passage were determined considering the anatomical parameters. In the right ankle the lateral to medial screw should enter 4.56 cm and 0.79 above and posterior to lateral malleolus, with one inclination of 17.34° in relation to tibial longitudinal axis; and 0° in relation to tibial axial plane. The position for the other two screws is also described. Our article is the first to presents one precise guide for ankle arthrodesis based on a populational assessment. <i>Level of evidence II, Diagnostic Studies.</i>
