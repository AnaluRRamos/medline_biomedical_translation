To compare the use of anchors with double and single-thread loading in the single-row Bankart arthroscopic procedure. 252 patients (258 shoulders) underwent Bankart arthroscopic surgery with evaluation after a minimum follow-up of 2 years. They underwent repairs either using anchors with single loading of a high-resistance non-absorbable braided thread (206 shoulders; group AS) or using double loading of thread with the same characteristics (52 shoulders; group AD). The patients were evaluated using the UCLA and Carter-Rowe scales. The patients' return to sports activity and recurrences were also compared. There was no significant difference between the groups regarding the surgical failure rate (group AS 5.8%; group AD 7.7%; p = 0.62). Group AS presented a better mean Carter-Rowe score (group AS 94.4; group AD 88.6; p < 0.05) and greater return to the same sports level (group AS 79.1; group AD 72.1; p < 0.05). Use of anchors with double thread loading did not show any clinical advantage for arthroscopic repair of traumatic anterior shoulder instability, in relation to use of single-thread anchors, over a 2-year follow-up.
