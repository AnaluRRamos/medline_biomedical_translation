Avulsion fractures of the apophysis of the iliac crest have rare incidence and are little known. In this article, we report the case of an 11-year-old female patient who presented this injury after indirect trauma. From careful radiographic analysis, an avulsion fracture of the iliac crest was identified. It was decided to use nonsurgical treatment comprising analgesia and load restriction. This case report emphasizes the importance of suspecting avulsion fractures in cases of low-energy trauma, and also guides the treatment, so as to prevent functional deficit and deformities.
