Although not evident clinically, lesions to the prefrontal cortex cause great social and functional impairment to patients. The anterior cingulate cortex is intimately involved with motivational behavior and after injury to this area the onset of an apathetic state can be observed. This paper describes the case of a patient with traumatic brain injury to the prefrontal lobe presenting with a depressive syndrome associated with apathetic symptoms. After appropriate treatment for depression, intense apathy was revealed, an irreversible sequelae of the traumatic brain injury, constituting the main barrier to the patient's return of lifestyle and independence.
