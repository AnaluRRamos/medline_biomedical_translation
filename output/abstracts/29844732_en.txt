To evaluate the effectiveness of aspirin as prophylaxis for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA), and to analyze the incidence of bleeding during the post-operative period. This prospective study carried out in 2017 consisted of 37 patients indicated for THA with high risk for DVT. Immediately after the procedure, aspirin, elastic compression socks and early deambulation were initiated. Doppler ultrasound was performed in the legs 6 days and 6 weeks post-procedure to rule out venous thromboembolism. Hematometric variables and clinical criteria were used to detect bleeding. The incidence of VTE (venous thromboembolism) 6 days post-procedure was 21.6%. By 6 weeks post-procedure, it dropped to 8.1%, (p = 0.102). Only 2.7% were diagnosed with VTE, 6 days and also 6 weeks post-procedure. Within the immediate postoperative period, hemoglobin was lower (p < 0.001), in contrast to 6 weeks after surgery, when it returned to baseline levels. Aspirin was an effective chemical prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism in high-risk patients who underwent THA. There was no clinical record of postoperative bleeding and hematometric levels suggested that there was no chronic bleeding. Level of Evidence II; Prospective study.
