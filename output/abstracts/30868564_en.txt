During the last decade, research on germ-free mice has discovered that the gut microbiome (i.e. the normal bacteria colonizing the gastrointestinal tract) can programme brain function and behaviour during early development. At the same time a growing number of clinical studies have shown altered gut microflora in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), in combination with altered bacterial metabolites and inflammatory cytokines being part of the gut-brain axis. This review covers the concept of the microbiome; how it is established during childhood; how it is affected by malnutrition; how it can programme the development of the brain through epigenetic mechanisms; which pathways are used from the gut to the brain; and assesses findings that suggest the gut microbiome may be involved in ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders. This is a new research field with a number of exciting, but so far fragmented, findings indicating the important role of the normal microbiome in shaping the brain. Research also suggests that disruptions of the microbiome may be involved in the aetiology of neurodevelopmental disorders. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: The gut microbiome shapes the brain via the gut-brain axis. The microbiome may play a role in neurodevelopmental disorders.
