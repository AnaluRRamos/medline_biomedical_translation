To analyze association between prevalence and severity of dental caries and demographic, socioeconomic, behavioral and oral health status in adolescents. This was a cross-sectional study with secondary data on 5,558 adolescents examined in the SÃ£o Paulo State Oral Health Survey in 2015. The zero-inflated negative binomial regression model was used, considering sample weights. Prevalence ratios (PR), ratios of mean (RM) and confidence intervals (CI) were estimated. Caries prevalence was 71.7%, and was higher in females (PR=1.09 - 95%CI 1.04;1.15), associated with being behind at school (PR=1.11 - 95%CI 1.03;1.18), dental calculus (PR=1.10 - 95%CI 1.01;1.20) and no access to fluoridated water (PR=1.21 - 95%CI 1.01;1.45). Identification of factors associated with dental caries can instruct the programming of health services aimed at controlling the disease.
