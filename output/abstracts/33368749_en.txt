Canine leishmaniosis (CanL) is associated with an aberrant cutaneous immune response. Few studies have compared cutaneous immune cells among dogs with leishmaniosis or infected without leishmaniosis, and noninfected dogs. Evaluate the number of neutrophils, histiocytes, T lymphocytes, T-bet-positive, GATA3-positive, FoxP3-positive and interleukin (IL)-17-positive cells, in lesional (Group A) and normal-looking (Group B) skin of nine dogs with stage II/III leishmaniosis; in normal-looking PCR-positive (Group C; n = 6) or PCR-negative (Group D; n = 6) skin of infected dogs; and in the normal-looking skin of 12 noninfected dogs (Group E). Diagnosis of CanL considered clinical signs, clinicopathological abnormalities, detection of Leishmania amastigotes in lymph nodes, and/or bone marrow and positive serological results. Paraffin-embedded skin biopsies were processed for routine immunofluorescence and positive cells were identified using commercially available anti-canine antibodies. In Group A, there was a significantly higher number of neutrophils (P < 0.001), histiocytes (P = 0.012), T lymphocytes (P = 0.011), GATA3-positive (P = 0.02) and IL-17A-positive (P = 0.002) cells compared to Group E. In Group B, there was a significantly higher number of histiocytes (P = 0.02), T lymphocytes (P = 0.004), GATA3-positive (P = 0.006) and FoxP3-positive (P = 0.028) cells compared to Group E. There was no difference in between groups A and B and between groups C or D and E. In the lesional and/or normal-looking skin of dogs with moderate/severe CanL there is an infiltration of neutrophils, histiocytes, T lymphocytes, GATA3-, FoxP3- and IL17A-positive cells. By contrast, the number of these cells is not increased in the normal-looking skin of infected dogs without CanL compared to the skin of noninfected dogs.
