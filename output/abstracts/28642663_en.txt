To evaluate syndesmosis-only fixation in Weber C ankle fractures with tibiofibular diastasis and to assess the need for additional fibular fixation. Twenty-one patients with Weber C ankle fractures and tibiofibular diastasis were followed for at least 24 months after treatment. In treatment of the Weber C fractures, only a syndesmosis screw was used through a mini open lateral incision if the syndesmosis could be anatomically reduced and fibular length and rotation could be restored. At follow-up, anteroposterior tibiofibular distance, lateral fibular distance, medial mortise distance and fracture healing were compared and patients were clinically evaluated using the Olerud and Molander ankle scale scoring system. The average duration of follow-up was 49 months and the decreases in anteroposterior tibiofibular distance and lateral fibular distance were statistically significant. At the last follow-up the average clinical score was 86. Ankle mortise was reduced at follow-up in all cases except one, which resulted in a late diastasis. Syndesmosis-only fixation can be an effective method of treating Weber type-C lateral malleolar fractures with syndesmosis disruption in cases where intraoperative fibular length can be restored and anatomical syndesmosis reduction can be achieved. <b><i>Level of Evidence IV, Case Series.</i></b>
