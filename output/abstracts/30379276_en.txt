To compare the neurobehavioral development of preterm infants with postconceptional age between 32 and 36 weeks and 6 days, according to the adequacy of the weight for the gestational age at birth. A cross-sectional study was performed comparing two independent groups. The 55 preterm infants who were included in the sample were hospitalized in a neonatal intermediate care unit and were evaluated using the Neurobehavioral Assessment of the Preterm Infant (NAPI) at the postconceptional age between 32 and 36 weeks and 6 days and compared according to the adequacy of the weight for the gestational age. In addition to the comparison between the groups, infants who were born small for gestational age (SGA) and those ones adequate for gestational age (AGA) were also compared, considering the type of intrauterine growth. The following instruments were used: NAPI, anamnesis script, Brazilian Economic Classification Criteria, and medical records. Infants were born with mean gestational age of 32.0 weeks, with the postconceptional age and postnatal age of 34.8 weeks and 19.5 days, respectively. The sample consisted of 55% of female infants. The results did not show any differences in NAPI domains between SGA and AGA groups, neither in the subgroups of SGA babies with symmetric or asymmetric growth. There was no difference between SGA and AGA babies in relation to neurobehavioral development evaluated before reaching term.
