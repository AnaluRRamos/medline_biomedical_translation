to evaluate how orthopedic surgeons in Latin America define the working length for distinct patterns of femoral shaft fracture. a survey was developed presenting different options of working length in four femoral fracture patterns. The survey was submitted to the participants using Google Forms tool. The association between professional characteristics and medical management options according to each type of fracture was analyzed by Chi-square test, with 5% significance level. seven hundred and seven professionals from all Latin America answered the survey. The majority prefered a smaller working length for all situations presented in the study. There was a significant association between the main interest area and the medical preference for the management in fracture types AO 32-B3 and 32-C2 (p<0.05). Other professional characteristics had no significant association at the level of 5%. most of the study participants preferred constructions with smaller working length, representing approximately one-third of the total length of the plate, regardless of fracture pattern. There was a significant association between the main interest area (orthopedic trauma) and medical management options for fracture type AO 32-B3 and 32-C2. This can be attributed in part to the fact that these two types of fractures are considered, in the view of the authors, intermediate patterns in terms of strain. This study reinforces the importance of understanding the concept of working length, showing that its calculation remains more based on the surgeons' experience than grounded by strong biomechanical concepts governing the fracture healing process.
