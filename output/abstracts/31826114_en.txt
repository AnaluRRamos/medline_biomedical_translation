The identification of the time trend of physical activity can help in the evaluation of the effectiveness of programs aimed at the promotion of physical activity at the population scope. To analyze the temporal trend of leisure time physical activity in adults living in the city of Curitiba (Brazil), from 2006-2015. This is a cross-sectional study with 19,183 adults, obtaining information on duration, intensity and weekly frequency of leisure-time physical activity from the Surveillance System of Risk and Protection Factors for Chronic Diseases by Telephone Inquiry. Adults who reported participating in leisure time physical activity at least once a week in the three months prior to the survey were considered active. Men's leisure-time physical activity was stable overtime (p = 0.28), while it increased significantly among women (1.86% per year, 95%CI 0.55; 3.37; p = 0.02). Men reported less activities with weekly frequency of one to two times (-3.75% per year, 95%CI -6.72; -0.67; p = 0.03) but more with weekly frequencies of five to six times (7.42% per year, 95%CI 4.54; 10.38; p = 0.001). No changes were observed in the frequency of physical activity among women. Monitoring indicators of physical activity in the city of Curitiba can assist legislators in building policies to promote physical activity.
