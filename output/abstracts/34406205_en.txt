to analyze the sociodemographic and clinical profile of patients treated by the remote care service 'Telessaúde-COVID' and the factors associated with positive results for COVID-19. an exploratory and analytical study, carried out based on the analysis of patient records treated by a remote care service called 'Telessaúde-COVID'. Characteristics of the patients treated and variables related to the service's functioning were evaluated. A descriptive, inferential analysis was performed by logistic regression. 1,854 new patients were evaluated and an estimate of 8,630 visits. Female patients were predominant (60.9%), aged between 20 and 59 years (75.9%). The most frequent signs and symptoms were: headache (41.8%), cough (33.3%) and runny nose (30.0%). Of the total number of patients, 66.4% were reported as suspected case of COVID-19 and 14.5% tested positive for COVID-19. The age of 60 years or more was more common among confirmed cases (26.6%). Most patients (80.4%) did not require face-to-face assistance. Confirmed cases of COVID-19 were associated with the age of the patients (OR 1,020; IC95% 1,007 - 1,032); home contact with a confirmed/suspected case (OR 1,902; IC95% 1,178 - 3,070); presence of nausea/vomiting (OR 2,403; IC95% 1,148 - 5,029) and changes in smell (OR 2,827; IC95% 1,294 - 6,176). 'Telessaúde-COVID' was relevant in the management and notification of cases, avoiding the search for face-to-face consultations without clinical indication. Among the suspected cases, positivity for COVID-19 was associated with aging, history of home contact, gastrointestinal and olfactory symptoms.
