To verify how hand surgeons manage scaphoid fractures and their complications. Two hundred questionnaires were distributed during the 36<sup>th</sup> Brazilian Hand Surgery Congress (2016). On suspicion of fracture without radiographic confirmation, 57% of surgeons request a CT or MRI scan, while 43% opt for immobilization and consecutive radiographs. In stable fractures the preference was for treatment with plaster cast. In fractures with no scaphoid waist displacement, 33% opt for percutaneous fixation. In displaced waist or proximal pole fractures, 66% and 99.4%, respectively, opted for surgical treatment. Most surgeons treat waist nonunion with a nonvascularized bone graft. When absorption at the site of nonunion is greater than 4 mm, 50% prefer to use iliac graft and screw fixation. In proximal pole nonunion, the Zaidemberg technique is preferred by 64%. More experienced surgeons are more likely to request tests in occult fractures (63.9% versus 47.6%; p=0.04), and tend to recommend surgery for distal third fractures more frequently (16.4% versus 4.7%; p=0.02). We have provided an overview of treatment preferences for scaphoid fractures. It should be noted that more experienced surgeons are more likely to request additional tests for occult fractures and to recommend surgical treatment of distal third fractures. <b><i>Level of Evidence IV, Cross-sectional survey.</i></b>
