To evaluate the concordance for the curve pattern, side and levels of the superior apical vertebrae, apex and inferior apical vertebrae of curves in patients and their relatives with idiopathic scoliosis. Concordance according to the Lenke classification for curve pattern, side and levels of the superior apical vertebrae, apex and inferior apical vertebrae were evaluated comparative and prospectively in 243 pairs of patients and respective relatives with idiopathic scoliosis. The family concordance for the curve pattern and side was 51.4% (125 pairs). Among these pairs, the concordance of the levels of the vertebrae was 91.2% (114 pairs). The concordance rate for the curve pattern and side between parents/children was 51.6% and between siblings was 50.0% (p-value= 0.411). The concordance rates of the levels of vertebrae were 86.8% and 95.1%, respectively (p-value = 0.219). Curve shape in idiopathic scoliosis is related to family and degree of kinship, since the data showed a high concordance for the curve pattern, side and levels of the apical vertebrae and apex between patients and relatives with this deformity. The concordance was higher in those with a closer degree of kinship. <b><i>Level of Evidence II, Lesser Quality Prospective Study.</i></b>
