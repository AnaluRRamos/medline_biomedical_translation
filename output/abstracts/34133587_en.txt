Mitral regurgitation (MR) is prevalent in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). There are some controversies about the prognostic impact of MR in survival of TAVI patients. To examine the relationship between TAVI and MR in a patient population from the Brazilian TAVI Registry. Seven hundred and ninety-five patients from the Brazilian TAVI Registry were divided at baseline, discharge, and follow-up according to their MR grade as follows: absent/mild (AMMR) or moderate/severe (MSMR). They were subsequently regrouped according to their immediate and late changes in MR severity after TAVI as follows: no change, improved, or worsened MR. Predictors and prognostic impact on baseline as well as changes in MR severity were analyzed. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Baseline MSMR was present in 19.3% of patients and was a predictor of increased late mortality. Immediately after TAVI, 47.4 % of cases improved to AMMR, predicted by a higher Society of Thoracic Surgeons score and a higher grade of baseline aortic regurgitation. Upon follow-up, 9.2% of cases of AMMR worsened to MSMR, whereas 36.8% of cases of MSMR improved to AMMR. Lower baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and improvement in LVEF at follow-up were predictors of MR improvement. Progressive worsening of MR upon follow-up was an independent predictor of higher late mortality after TAVI (p = 0.005). Baseline MSMR predicts late mortality after TAVI. Lower LVEF and improved LVEF at follow-up predict MR improvement after TAVI. Progressive worsening of MR severity at follow-up is an independent predictor of late mortality, which is a rare finding in the literature.
