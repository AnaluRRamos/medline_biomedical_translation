The management of patients, such as Jehovah's Witnesses, who refuse to receive blood transfusions, is often a medical challenge, not only because of the ethical dilemma, but also because it creates a major obstacle to rapid hemorrhage control in a setting of trauma. This article explores the reasons for this conflict between the physician's duty of care and the respect for the patient's autonomy, and draws a panorama of the main understandings of the Judiciary on the subject. Finally, it is concluded that the manifestation of the patient's will, although free, is not enough to release the doctor from his (her) duty of care. In case of danger to life, the doctor must carry out a blood transfusion, regardless of the patient's consent or the permission of those responsible for the patient.
