Aging is an inevitable process that has a social impact in the forecoming decades, and it will present a great challenge regarding public health. An efficient health system requires a reflection on the preventive measures to be implemented. The study population comprised a total number of 2672 individuals of both genders, aged 55 years and over, residents in continental Portugal, to whom a questionnaire was applied that included the following sections: Social network; Locomotion; Physical autonomy; Instrumental autonomy; Cognitive assessment; Physical activity. The study of aging in the Portuguese population found that physical autonomy for tasks related to daily life are associated with better cognitive evaluation. A statistically significant association was found between performance in cognitive assessment and gender, age, schooling, the fact of living alone, the number of hours being alone, autonomy to walk in the street, washing, dressing, eating, preparing meals, doing shopping, managing money and taking medications and washer / treat clothing. Cognitive evaluation is negatively influenced by the number of hours that an individual is alone. Activities of daily life must be valued, since they require the ability to plan and carry out tasks and their preservation is a key component in successful aging.
