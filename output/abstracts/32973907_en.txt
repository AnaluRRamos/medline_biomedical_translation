To describe the genotypes of the carbapenemases reported from microbiological isolates of patients in Peru. A systematic search of the biomedical literature about carbapenemases with genotypic confirmation was carried out. It included literature published from 1 January 2000 through 15 September 2019 in the PubMed, SCOPUS, Virtual Health Library, CONCYTEC Virtual Library, and Google Scholar databases, and other sources for the publication of abstracts or posters from national or international meetings. Two reviewers carried out the data selection and extraction. Fourteen studies, which carried out the genotypic characterization of 313 carbapenemases, were included. Of the total 313 reports, 103 analyzed enterobacteria: 74 were of <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>, 11 of <i>Proteus mirabilis</i>, 7 of <i>Enterobacter cloacae,</i> and 11 of other enterobacteria; and 61 corresponded to <i>bla</i> <sub><i>NDM</i></sub> , 39 to <i>bla</i> <sub><i>KPC,</i></sub> and 3 to <i>bla</i> <sub><i>IMP</i></sub> <i>.</i> According to their molecular structure, 64 were metallo-ß-lactamases and 39 were serine-ß-lactamases. Of the total reports, 84 analyzed <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>: 79 corresponded to <i>bla</i> <sub><i>IMP</i></sub> , 4 to <i>bla</i> <sub><i>VIM</i></sub> , and 1 to <i>bla</i> <sub><i>GES.</i></sub> Of the total reports, 126 analyzed <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>: 55 corresponded to <i>bla</i> <sub><i>OXA-23</i></sub> , 66 to <i>bla</i> <sub><i>OXA-24</i></sub> , 3 to <i>bla</i> <sub><i>NDM,</i></sub> and 2 to <i>bla</i> <sub><i>OXA-143</i></sub> . There is a limited number of publications about carbapenemases among patients in Peru. The genotype reports come primarily from hospitals in the country's capital. This is the first review that aims to identify the types of carbapenemases reported in enterobacteria, <i>P. aeruginosa</i>, and <i>A. baummani</i>.
