To develop an anatomical nasal protector for newborns using prongs. A descriptive study and technological production based on the Product Development Process, which involved informational design, conceptual design and detailed design phases, between March 2017 and February 2019. The design and materialization of nasal protectors were achieved in hydrocolloid plates. These were reprocessed by five sterilization methods: ultraviolet and gamma radiation, gaseous formaldehyde, hydrogen peroxide plasma and saturated steam under pressure. Microbiological tests indicated bacterial growth after processing by formaldehyde and ultraviolet radiation. Gamma radiation guaranteed the sterility and stability of the material. Three classifications of nasal hydrocolloid protectors were achieved after the tests, with safe and promising characteristics to continue studies aiming at the clinical evaluation in newborns using prongs.
