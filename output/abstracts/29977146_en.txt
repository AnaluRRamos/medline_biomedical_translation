The objective of this study was to present a proposal tomographic classification for intra-articular distal radius fractures. This descriptive study was based on observing tomographic images from 74 patients with distal radius fractures. The cases were grouped by similarity according to the presence of several parameters which determine fracture complexity; the results of the descriptive analysis were transcribed as tomographic classification. The proposal tomographic classification for intra-articular distal radius fractures comprised three major groups and nine sub-groups, which are organized by increasing severity according to the presence of spacing between articular fragments, angulation, loss of radial height, cortical depression, and associated dislocation. This proposal tomographic classification for intra-articular distal radius fractures can help professionals indicate therapeutic options. Level of Evidence IV; Case series.
