The approach for treating a hemodynamically unstable patient remains a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Stabilization of the patient should be rapid and effective, but there is not much room for error. This narrow window of intervention makes it necessary to use rapid and accurate hemodynamic evaluation methods. Echocardiography is the method of choice for the bedside evaluation of patients in circulatory shock. In fact, it was intensive care physicians who recognized the potential of Doppler echocardiography for the initial approach to patients in circulatory failure. An echocardiogram allows rapid anatomical and functional cardiac evaluation, which may include non-invasive hemodynamic evaluation using a Doppler study. Such an integrated study may provide data of extreme importance for understanding the mechanisms underlying the hemodynamic instability of the patient to allow the rapid institution of appropriate therapeutic measures. In the present article, we describe the most relevant echocardiographic findings using a practical approach for critical patients with hemodynamic instability.
