The risk-benefit ratio of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is usually considered favorable due to the urgent need to control the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Current studies have shown that combined ART (two or more drugs, from two different classes) is the most effective, with benefits that go beyond clinical management of the disease playing a crucial role in preventing HIV transmission. Therefore, early identification of HIV infection followed by immediate initiation of ART has been encouraged worldwide. However, the success of this strategy has been threatened by poor engagement of patients in HIV care, which may be related to drug harms. In addition, ART is required for the life course, creating the potential for adverse drug reactions (e.g., lipodystrophies). Therefore, adverse drug reactions are a prevalent concern among people living with HIV/AIDS, even in the current era of early initiation of ART ('early ART'), with most drugs considered much safer than those used in previous eras. Accurate diagnosis, recording, and reporting, followed up with proper management and prevention, and intensive surveillance, of new and known adverse reactions to ART, should be strongly encouraged as part of the care continuum.
