Hemorrhoid disorders are common. This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of polidocanol foam injected at high doses with intravenous needle for the treatment of symptomatic internal hemorrhoids that prolapse or bleed. We evaluated 2,000 consecutive patients with prolapsed hemorrhoids (grades II/III/IV) recruited over 6 years. Foam injection was performed in one to four sessions with polidocanol 2%: 10 mL of the mixture (2 mL liquid plus air) or 20 mL (4 mL liquid plus air). The number of sessions and amount of foam injected depended on initial hemorrhoid size, compliance to receive foam, and clinical response. The mixture, prepared using a three-way tap connected to two 10/20-mL syringes, was injected immediately after preparation using an intravenous needle. The primary endpoint was self-reported satisfaction without major complications at 4 weeks. Efficacy was very high, with 1,957 patients (98%) reporting satisfaction regarding blood loss control and prolapse reduction. The procedure was well tolerated: 1,838 patients (92%) presented mild/no pain. Objective reduction of prolapse volume was documented in 86% of reobserved cases. Complications were rare and usually minor: only 3 cases of clinically significant bleeding (0.15%), 2 of whom were on dual antiplatelet therapy plus oral anticoagulation, 2 cases of rectal abscess, 8 hemorrhoid thromboses, and 1 urinary retention requiring catheter (0.7% severe complications). Treatment of internal hemorrhoids with polidocanol foam injected in high doses is very effective and safe for the control of blood loss and prolapse, even for patients on anticoagulation/antiplatelet treatment.
