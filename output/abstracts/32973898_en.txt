Describe the results of the Program for the Rational Use of Antimicrobials at Mexico's Ju√°rez Hospital. An observational, cross-sectional, retrospective, descriptive study was designed. For the consumption of antimicrobial agents, data from January 2013 to December 2018 were analyzed by calculating the defined daily dose (DDD). For the cost analysis, a traditional costing calculation was used. For the group of carbapenem agents, there was a sizeable reduction in the consumption of imipenem / cilastatin: the DDD declined from 2.3 in 2013 to 0.7 in 2018, a decrease of 70%. By contrast, for the other two agents, increases were observed. The consumption of meropenem increased by 2% (from 2.4 in 2013 to 2.5 in 2018); the consumption of ertapenem increased by 75% (from 1 in 2013 to 1.8 in 2018). The total expenditure on antimicrobial agents was USD 930 556.46 during 2013, compared to USD 856 079.10 during 2018, representing a difference of 8% or USD 74 905.61 of the total expenditure. Programs for the rational use of antimicrobials need to be evaluated continuously, by monitoring both consumption of agents by patients and related institutional expenditures.
