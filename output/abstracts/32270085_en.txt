Integrative review of studies conducted in Brazil from 2010 to 2017. The literature search was performed on the Virtual Health Library database. Combination of descriptors and application of filters resulted in seven articles. Duplicates, doctoral dissertations and articles which did not meet the study aims were excluded. Mental suffering impairs the family, social, personal and professional life of nursing professionals, their studies, self-comprehension and understanding of others, self-criticism ability, acceptance of problems and possibility to take pleasure in life as a whole. The physical load resulting from a large volume of activities, understaffing, large numbers of patients and psychological pressure in the workplace contribute to the development of mental disorders. The pressure to which nursing professionals are exposed in the workplace and double shifts, together with coping modalities and low salary contribute to sick leaves due to mental disorders. However, broader scoped studies are needed.
