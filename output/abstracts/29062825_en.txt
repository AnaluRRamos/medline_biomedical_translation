To evaluate the arc of forearm pronosupination of patients with sequelae of birth paralysis and correlate with these variables. 32 children aged between 4 and 14 years with total or partial lesions of the brachial plexus were evaluated; measurements of pronation and supination, active and passive, were made, both on the injured side and the unaffected side. A statistically significant difference was observed between the injured side and the normal side, but there was no difference between the groups regarding age or type of injury. The age and type of injury did not impact on the limitation of the forearm pronosupination in children with sequelae of birth paralysis.
