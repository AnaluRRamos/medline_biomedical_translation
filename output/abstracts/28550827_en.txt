Helicobacter pylori eradication has become increasingly difficult as resistances to several antibiotics develop. We aimed to compare Helicobacter pylori eradication rates between triple therapy and sequential therapy in a naive Portuguese population. Prospective randomized trial including consecutive patients referred for first-line Helicobacter pylori eradication treatment. previous gastric surgery/neoplasia, pregnancy/lactancy, allergy to any of the drugs. The compared eradication regimens were triple therapy (pantoprazol, amoxicillin and clarithromycin 12/12 hours, 14 days) and sequential therapy (pantoprazol 12/12 hours for 10 days, amoxicillin 12/12 hours for days 1 - 5 and clarithromycin plus metronidazol 12/12 hours during days 6 - 10). Eradication success was confirmed with urea breath test. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS v21.0 and a p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Included 60 patients, 39 (65%) female with mean age 52 years (SD ± 14.3). Treatment groups were homogeneous for gender, age, indication for treatment and smoking status. No statistical differences were encountered between sequential and triple therapy eradication rates (86.2% vs 77.4%, p = 0.379), global eradication rate was 82%. Tobacco consumption was associated with a significantly lower eradication success (54.5 vs 87.8%, p = 0.022). In this randomized controlled trial in a naive Portuguese population, we found a satisfactory global Helicobacter pylori eradication rate of 82%, with no statistical differences observed in the efficacy of the treatment between triple and sequential regimens. These results support the use of either therapy for the first-line eradication of Helicobacter pylori.
