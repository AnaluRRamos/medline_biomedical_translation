The current transversal and descriptive study evaluates the prevalence and factors associated with cognitive liabilities in a sample of 98 elderly people residents of philanthropic institutions. The sociodemographic and clinical data were retrieved from the patientsÂ´ clinical charts. The cognition was assessed by the Mental State Mini-Exam, while the maintenance of independence regarding basic activities (such as bathing, putting on clothes, and others) was evaluated using the Katz Index. The Short Physical Performance Battery exam assessed their physical performance. Non-parametric tests were employed for the statistical analysis. Cognitive impairment was registered in 27.6% of the elderlies and was not associated with sociodemographic variables, independence in basic activities, and physical performance. We verified a high prevalence of endocrine diseases, mental disorders, and psychiatric treatment in the elderlies with cognitive impairments. The percentage of elderly with cognitive alterations is similar to those found in the literature. We identified no significant risk factors associated with cognition among the evaluated variables.
