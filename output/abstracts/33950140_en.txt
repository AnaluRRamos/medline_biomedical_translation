To analyze the association between diet quality assessed with the Diet Quality Scale (ESQUADA) and the nutritional status and metabolic risk in adults. The data included 1,147 adults aged 20 to 59, from the population-based study with complex sampling. Weight, height, tricipital (TSF) and subscapular (SSF) skinfolds, and waist (WC) and mid-arm (MAC) circumferences were measured. Body mass index (BMI) and mid-arm muscle circumference (MAMC) were calculated. Nutritional status and metabolic risk were classified considering BMI and WC values, respectively. Diet quality was assessed with ESQUADA. Data were collected at household using the Epicollect5 application. Diet quality (in scores) was analyzed as continuous data and later categorized. The confidence interval was used for comparison between groups, Fisher's exact test for an association study. Adjusted multiple linear regression models were also estimated. P < 0.05 was adopted for statistical significance. Overweight prevailed in 60.33% of individuals, especially among women (60.73%). High or very high metabolic risk was more frequent among women with 'very good or excellent' diet quality. Higher diet quality score was associated with a reduction in TSF (β = -0.07; 95%CI -0.13 - -0.01) and an increase in MAMC (β = 0.09; 95%CI 0.00 - 0,18) in men and the reduction in weight (β = -0.04; 95%CI -0.07 - -0.01), SSF (β = -0.07; 95%CI -0.13 - -0,00) and WC in women (β = -0.06; 95%CI -0.09 - -0.02). A better diet quality is positively associated with lean mass in men, and negatively with fat mass in men and women.
