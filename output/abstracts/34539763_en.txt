To describe the epidemiology of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in Colombia. Critical review of epidemiological studies of HCV infection in Colombia. The PubMed, SciELO, and ScienceDirect databases were searched for original articles and reviews on the subject published from 1989 to 2020. Reports from the National Institute of Health and the High Cost Account of the Ministry of Health and Social Protection were also reviewed. Data on seroprevalence of HCV antibodies in blood donors range from 1.5% to 0.32%, corresponding to reports at the beginning and end of the study period, respectively. In the population with risk factors, a high prevalence of HCV infection is observed, although with variations over time. With respect to HCV genotypes in Colombia, genotypes 1, 2, 3, and 4 (subtypes 1a, 1b, 2a, and 3a) have been identified. In the observation period, a decrease was seen in seroprevalence of HCV infection in blood donors and hemodialysis patients in Colombia, demonstrating the impact of safe blood policies and biosafety measures. Studies in people who inject illicit drugs indicate a high prevalence of infection, with regional differences within the country. HCV genotype 1, subtype 1b, is the most frequent in the different studies carried out in Colombia, and the most recent report of the High Cost Account of the Ministry of Health and Social Protection indicates that genotype 4 is the second most frequent genotype in the country.
