Identify in patients with type 2 diabetes what changes in the feet would be associated with demographic, clinical, biochemical and treatment characteristics and which would increase the risk of mortality. Retrospective longitudinal study evaluating the alterations in feet of outpatients attended at a nursing visit. Data from the clinical history and foot exam were collected from 918 medical records of a convenience sample. At 10 years, the cumulative mortality attributable to peripheral polyneuropathy was 44.7%, to peripheral artery disease was 71.7%, to both conditions were 62.4%, and to amputation was 67.6%. After multivariate analysis, duration of nursing follow-up remained as the only protective factor against death (p < 0.001). The risk of death in these patients decreased when they had consultations with a nurse educator. Ischemic feet, amputation, and coronary artery disease remained independent risk factors.
