Dogs with atopic dermatitis are often immunoglobulin (Ig)E-sensitised to Dermatophagoides farinae (Df) house dust mites, yet limited data exist on the sensitisation rates to the individual Df allergens, Der f 2 and Zen 1. To determine the IgE sensitisation rates to Df, Der f 2 and Zen 1 in atopic dogs from geographically diverse countries. Serum was collected from 32 laboratory dogs in Japan, and 837 atopic dogs from 11 countries from five continents: Asia (Japan, Thailand, Taiwan), Europe (Italy, Latvia, the Netherlands, UK), North America (USA), South America (Argentina, Brazil) and Africa (South Africa). We determined Df-, Der f 2- and Zen 1-specific IgE levels by ELISA. Correlations between the IgE values for these three allergens were calculated. The IgE seropositivity rates for Df varied between 74% (Argentina) and 100% (the Netherlands, Thailand, South Africa), those for Der f 2 between 12% (Argentina) and 88% (South Africa), and for Zen 1 between 70% (Argentina) and 100% (the Netherlands). Apart from the especially low seropositivity rate for Der f 2-specific IgE in Argentina, the percentage of IgE sensitisation varied little between countries. There was significant correlation between the IgE levels to these three allergens which was highest between Df and Zen 1, and lowest between Zen 1 and Der f 2. The IgE sensitisation to Df is geographically widespread. Der f 2 and Zen 1 are major allergens for dogs in almost all countries where this was evaluated.
