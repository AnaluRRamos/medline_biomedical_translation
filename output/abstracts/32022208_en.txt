Analysis of the distribution of motorcycle-related mortality rates in Brazilian municipalities is fundamental to understand and seek to minimize the occurrence of this growing phenomenon. The main objective of this work is to analyze the spatial distribution of motorcycle rider mortality rates in Brazil, based on more robust and reliable estimates. An attempt was also made to identify the presence of spatial clusters in the distribution of such mortality rates in given municipalities. The rates were estimated based on the average number of motorcyclist deaths recorded in the years 2014, 2015 and 2016. These rates were then directly standardized and graduated based on the local empirical Bayesian estimator. A Local Indicator of Spatial Autocorrelation (LISA) indicated the presence of spatial patterns. The Northeast and Mid-West regions concentrated most of the municipalities with high mortality rates as well and most of the clusters of municipalities with a high-high distribution pattern. Graduated Bayesian estimation was effective to deal with the occurrence of extreme values, thereby improving the reliability of the estimates and enhancing the visualization of the rates on the map.
