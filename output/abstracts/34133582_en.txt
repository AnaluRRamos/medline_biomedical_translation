Despite growing evidence that N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) has an important prognostic value in older adults, there is limited data on its prognostic predictive value. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical significance of NT-proBNP in hospitalized patients older than 80 years of age in Beijing, China. This prospective, observational study was conducted in 724 very elderly patients in a geriatric ward (age ≥80 years, range, 80100 years, mean, 86.6 3.0 years). Multivariate linear regression analysis was used to screen for factors independently associated with NT-proBNP, and the Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to screen for relationships between NT-proBNP levels and major endpoints. The major endpoints assessed were all-cause death and MACEs. P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The prevalence rates of coronary heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus were 81.4%, 75.1%, and 41.2%, respectively. The mean NT-proBNP level was 770 ± 818 pg/mL. Using multivariate linear regression analyses, correlations were found between plasma NT-proBNP and body mass index, atrial fibrillation, estimated glomerular filtration rate, left atrial diameter, left ventricular ejection fraction, use of betablocker, levels of hemoglobin, plasma albumin, triglycerides, serum creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen. The risk of all-cause death (HR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.0052.642; P = 0.04) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE; HR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.2893.531; P = 0.04) in the group with the highest NT-proBNP level was significantly higher than that in the group with the lowest level, according to Cox regression models after adjusting for multiple factors. As expected, echocardiography parameters adjusted the prognostic value of NT-proBNP in the model. NT-proBNP was identified as an independent predictor of all-cause death and MACE in hospitalized patients older than 80 years of age.
