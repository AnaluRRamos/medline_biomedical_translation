In Brazil, the distribution of pediatric intensive care units (PICUs), causes of admission, costs incurred and how care is provided are still poorly understood. The objective was to describe the profile of hospitalizations in the PICUs of the Brazilian Unified Health System in the state of Pernambuco, in 2010. A cross-sectional study was performed, with 1,915 hospitalizations in the six PICUs, collected in the Hospital Information System. The variables were compared by age group. There was a predominance of male hospitalizations (58.1%), an age range of between one and four years old (32.5%), the use of philanthropic units (64.1%) and type III PICUs (59.2%) and admissions due to neoplasms (28.9%). The mean hospital stay was 14.4 days, and the mean cost was BRL 6,674.80. The mean distance between the municipality of residence and the PICU ranged from 8.7 to 486.5 km. There were 207 deaths (10.8/100 admissions), of which 30% were due to infectious and parasitic diseases. Differences were identified between the age groups (p < 0.05), except regarding gender. In conclusion, admissions to PICUs in Pernambuco show differences in geographical access and sociodemographic characteristics, admissions, and causes of hospitalization and death among age groups.
