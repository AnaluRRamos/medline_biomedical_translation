To evaluate the structure and adherence to the standardized and specific precautionary measures of health professionals in the Intensive Care Unit of a teaching hospital in the Federal District of Brazil. A descriptive, cross-sectional and prospective study. A structured questionnaire was used via observations which recorded the practices of professionals with Individual Protection Equipment and indications of precautions. The chi-square test was applied, and the p-value was calculated. A total of 52 professionals participated in the study, and 445 care procedures were observed in 36 audit sessions. The average adhesion rate for equipment use was 72.72%, with 94.91% for gloves, 91.43% for aprons, 80% for masks and 24.56% for safety glasses. When there was no indication and no personal protective equipment was used, the average rate was 68.01%, with 30.77% for gloves, 87.58% for aprons, 57.58% for masks, and 96.13% for safety glasses. Contact precautions were unnecessarily indicated for 35% of patients. Good adherence to using gloves, aprons and masks were observed, but there was poor adherence to using safety glasses and unnecessary use of masks and admission contact precautions.
