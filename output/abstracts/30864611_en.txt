In this article, we analyze beliefs and practices among young high school students who seek out or consider the possibility of terminating a pregnancy. We selected students from a public school located in a rural, peasant community in México City, México. This is a constructivist ethnographic study based on in-depth interviews with 15 sexually-active women aged between 18 and 24 years. The interviews were recorded with participants' authorization and informed consent. Results indicate that social stigmas persist which affect the dignity of women who have chosen to have an abortion. However, Catholic ideologies do not seem persuasive for participants who chose to carry the unwanted pregnancy to term. In any case, the absence of confidentiality in the clinics may lead young women to opt for clandestine spaces or for self-medication, usually based on natural medicine or abortive pills. Significantly, participants acknowledged that they did not use condoms and that they occasionally use oral contraceptives. The public health system in the community does not always guarantee confidentiality for legal terminations, for this reason participants do not consider it the first option for having an abortion. On the other hand, sexual education projects are indispensable for enabling young women to avoid unwanted pregnancies and to freely exercise their sexual and reproductive rights. Additionally, actions are needed for sensitizing and training education workers.
