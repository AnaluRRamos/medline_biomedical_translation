To report a case of median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS) and to review current literature. Case report and literature review using PubMed with the terms 'median arcuate ligament', 'Dunbar syndrome' and 'MALS treatment' as major topics. The bibliography of relevant articles has been checked to identify other significant papers. Median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS) or Dunbar syndrome is a rare clinical entity characterized by celiac trunk compression by median arcuate ligament and variable gastrointestinal symptoms. However, some degree of radiographic compression is observed in 10%-24% of asymptomatic patients, so MALS is a diagnosis of exclusion. Treatment options include release of median arcuate ligament (open, laparoscopic or robot-assisted) and open vascular reconstruction. Endovascular treatment is currently used only as adjuvant procedure after surgical release of median arcuate ligament. A 34-year-old woman, previously healthy, presented with a epigastric pain, mainly postprandial, for 6 months, associated to anorexia and unprovoked weight loss of 8kg over 3 months. Physical examination was normal. Other gastrointestinal pathologies were ruled out. Abdomino-pelvic computed tomography angiography revealed a focal 80% stenosis of proximal celiac trunk. An open decompression of the celiac trunk was performed. The postoperative period was uneventful and the patient was discharged 5 days later, with normal gastrointestinal transit and without abdominal pain recurrence. MALS diagnostic and therapeutic approach must be patient focused, bearing in mind the multiple clinical presentation and treatment options. Open surgical decompression of median arcuate ligament is the base of treatment.
