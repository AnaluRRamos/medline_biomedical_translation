To evaluate the effect of the design of a femoral vascular loop with anastomosis in the femoral artery of rabbits on the presence of flow (patency) after seven days. A total of 39 rabbits underwent arteriovenous microanastomosis using the microsurgical technique. Two loop designs were used: one circular and the other angled. The parameters evaluated were presence or absence of flow, signs of hemolysis and hemodynamic changes. After seven days, flow was present in 68% of the angled loops and 75% of the circular loops (p > 0.05). There was a significant intragroup decrease in pCO<sub>2</sub> and a significant increase in pH. For the other parameters evaluated, no significant differences between the two loop models were found. A reproducible vascular loop model was shown. There was no significant difference between the two vascular loop models about the presence of flow after seven days. <b>Level of Evidence V, Animal experimental study</b>.
