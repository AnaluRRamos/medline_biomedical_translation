On 5 November 2015, the Samarco Fe ore mining operations released approximately 50 million cubic meters of mining waste into the environment, due to a dam collapse. Aiming at understanding the potential effects on the Doce River, different regions of the course of tailings were monitored using acute and chronic ecotoxicological tests with 4 species: Ceriodaphnia dubia, Daphnia similis, Danio rerio, and Vibrio fischeri. The results showed no acute toxicity for water column organisms. However, chronic toxicity was observed with the tests with the microcrustacean C. dubia, mainly related to the physical effects of the passage of flood wave and increased suspended solids, given that toxicity was reduced after filtering the samples. The results showed different magnitudes of impact among the upper, middle, and lower Doce River, with greater impact close to the dam failure area. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2020;16:608-614.
