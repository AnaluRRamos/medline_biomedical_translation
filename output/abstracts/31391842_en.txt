Analyze the sustainability and integration of priority programs in the framework of the Pan American Health Organizationâ€™s 2014 Strategy for Universal Access to Health and Universal Health Coverage (Universal Health). A non-systematic review was carried out of the recent literature focused on analysis of integration and sustainability. The main result extracted from the literature review is the need to address sustainability in a way that goes beyond the limits of any analysis restricted to financial sustainability. Although integration and sustainability are not interpreted uniformly, an approach that includes integration as a facilitating factor of the EPI sustainability process does stand out. Effectiveness of EPI integration strategies depends to a large extent on considering the presence, strengthening, and transformation of organizational and institutional structures that facilitate the participation of actors with the technical and political ability to ensure its implementation processes. Thus, political processes can be weighed that legitimize an agenda to include EPI in the Universal Health strategy and, accordingly, as an integral part of health systems strengthening.
