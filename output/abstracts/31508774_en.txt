The scope of this paper is a discussion of the transformative relationship between scientific research and productive innovation, which occurred from the final quarter of the twentieth century onwards. The main characteristic of the phenomenon was an intense space-time approximation of the two activities. The human health sector has been one of the main fields where that approximation was most markedly observed. Some major conceptual bases of the reorganization are discussed, and the text examines works by Gibbons, Stokes and Lundvall-Freeman, as well as Merton, Kuhn and Bourdieu with respect to the organization of the scientific work. The paper highlights and discusses three aspects that arose from the new configuration, namely the erosion of the well-established concept of scientific knowledge as a public good, the appearance of the individual referred to as the 'entrepreneurial researcher' and the emergence of the strategy of translational research in health.
