to present our experience in the hypertelorbitism surgical treatment in craniofrontonasal dysplasia. retrospective analysis of craniofrontonasal dysplasia patients operated through orbital box osteotomy or facial bipartition between 1997 and 2015. Surgical data was obtained from medical records, complementary tests, photographs, and clinical interviews. Surgical results were classified based on the need for additional surgery and orbital relapse was calculated. seven female patients were included, of whom three (42.86%) underwent orbital box osteotomy and four (57.14%) underwent facial bipartition. There was orbital relapse in average of 3.71±3,73mm. Surgical result according to the need for further surgery was 2.43±0.53. surgical approach to hypertelorbitism in craniofrontonasal dysplasia should be individualized, respecting the age at surgery and preferences of patients, parents, and surgeons.
