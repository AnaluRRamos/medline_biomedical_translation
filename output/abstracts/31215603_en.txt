To describe the existing early mobilization protocols in pediatric intensive care units. A systematic literature review was performed using the databases MEDLINEÂ®, Embase, SciELO, LILACS and PeDRO, without restrictions of date and language. Observational and randomized and nonrandomized clinical trials that described an early mobilization program in patients aged between 29 days and 18 years admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit were included. The methodological quality of the studies was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies and the Cochrane Collaboration. A total of 8,663 studies were identified, of which 6 were included in this review. Three studies described the implementation of an early mobilization program, including activities such as progressive passive mobilization, positioning, and discussion of mobilization goals with the team, in addition to contraindications and interruption criteria. Cycle ergometer and virtual reality games were also used as resources for mobilization. Four studies considered the importance of the participation of the multidisciplinary team in the implementation of early mobilization protocols. In general, early mobilization protocols are based on individualized interventions, depending on the child's development. In addition, the use of a cycle ergometer may be feasible and safe in this population. The implementation of institutional and multidisciplinary protocols may contribute to the use of early mobilization in pediatric intensive care units; however, studies demonstrating the efficacy of such intervention are needed.
