To evaluate the core (First Contact, Longitudinality, Comprehensiveness, and Coordination of Services) and derivative (Family Orientation, Community Orientation) attributes of primary health care (PHC) from the perspective of users with and without disabilities. Observational, cross-sectional study using the Primary Care Assessment Tool (PCAT) with users with and without disabilities of five basic health units (BHU) in a municipality where 55% of the population depends on the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS). Scores were assigned to the responses given to each of the PHC attributes evaluated. Study participants were 93 (67 physically disabled and 26 without disabilities) PHC users. No statistically significant differences were observed for any attribute on the comparison between the populations. For both groups, the attributes Degree of Affiliation, First Contact - Utilization, Longitudinality, and Coordination of Services - Information System received satisfactory (above cutoff) scores, whereas the attributes First Contact - Accessibility, Coordination of Services - Care Integration, Comprehensiveness, Family Orientation, and Community Orientation received unsatisfactory (below cutoff) scores. Users reported that the health teams are able to satisfactorily identify mobility issues, but there are failures in the recognition of problems of hearing, voice/speech and vision, and in the orientation of services available and services provided. Users with and without disabilities evaluated the health care received similarly, indicating fragilities on the recognition of specific demands. Structural and work process changes should be conducted to ensure Accessibility, Comprehensiveness, and Family and Community Orientation, and thus increase the quality of PHC.
