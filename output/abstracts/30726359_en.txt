To estimate the prevalence of depressive symptoms in the elderly in SÃ£o Paulo city, Brazil (SABE Study), in 2006 and to identify risk factors associated with the 2006 prevalence and protective factors among those who did not have depressive symptoms in the assessments conducted in 2000 and 2006. In this cross-sectional and longitudinal study, the Geriatric Depression Scale was used for inclusion in the cohort in 2000 and also in 2006. The prevalence of depressive symptoms in 2006 was 14.2% (95%CI 11.8 - 16.7), and 74.8% of the participants did not present depressive symptoms in 2000 neither in 2006. Logistic regression models were constructed, with different groups of variables (socio-demographic variables, status and perception of health and memory) adjusted for sex and age. In the final logistic regression model, the following factors were associated with depressive symptoms: self-assessment of vision, oral health, memory and of general health as poor, dependence for basic activities of daily living, and moderate or severe family dysfunction. Protective factors against presenting depressive symptoms in the 2000 and 2006 phases were: being male, absence of pulmonary disease and positive self-assessment of health. Depressive symptoms were frequent among the elderly, and were associated with health problems, dependence and family dysfunction. These factors should be addressed in health policy planning for the care of these elderly.
