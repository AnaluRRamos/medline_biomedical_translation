Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) is a rare vascular malformation characterized by capillary malformation, venous malformations, and soft tissue or bone hypertrophy that affect the extremities in most cases. Knee or hip arthropathy are common associated conditions and cause serious disability. We present the case of a patient with a diagnosis of KTS and severe knee arthropathy. A 34-year-old man with KTS was referred to our hospital with severe knee arthropathy, with the joint fixed in a 90Â° position. CT Angiography and MRI of the left leg showed important varicose development of the superficial venous system with intraarticular vessels. After discussion of the case by a multidisciplinary committee, the patient was enrolled on a physiotherapy program and had achieved significant improvements in movement and quality of life at 12-month follow-up. Treatment of KTS is primarily conservative and a multidisciplinary approach is necessary.
