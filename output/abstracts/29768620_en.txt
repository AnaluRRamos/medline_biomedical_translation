This paper aims to verify the association between chronic diseases and handgrip strength (HS) in the older adults of Florianópolis, SC. This is a cross-sectional analysis of a longitudinal population-based study. HS was measured by dynamometer. Independent variables included 10 chronic diseases and falls. Simple and multiple linear regression analyses were performed. In the final model, in women, arthritis/rheumatism/arthrosis (β: -1.27; 95%CI: -2.55; -0.20) was associated with lower HS and bronchitis/ asthma (β: 1.61, 95%CI: 0.21; 3.00) was associated with higher HS. Regarding men, in the final model, diabetes (β:-3.78; 95%CI: -6.51; -1.05) was associated with lower HS. The trend analysis evidenced a lower HS with increased number of chronic diseases in both genders. There was an association between some chronic diseases and HS, with differences between genders. ĩt is essential to overhaul health policies aimed at maintaining the independence and autonomy of the older adults population.
