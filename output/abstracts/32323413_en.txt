The most common fly species associated with screwworm myiasis in Southeast Asia is Chrysomya bezziana (Ch. bezziana), the Old-World screwworm. Treatment of screwworm myiasis in cats traditionally has comprised subcutaneous injection of ivermectin or oral administration of nitenpyram, combined with aggressive tissue debridement and larval removal under general anaesthesia. Two cats diagnosed with cutaneous myiasis caused by the larvae of Ch. bezziana were treated with lotilaner. In both cats, a single dose of lotilaner at 6-26 mg/kg, killed all larvae within 24 h, negating the need for general anaesthesia. Both cats were simultaneously infested with Lynxacarus radovskyi (L. radovskyi) which also was eradicated with lotilaner. No adverse reactions were observed and both cats recovered without complications.
