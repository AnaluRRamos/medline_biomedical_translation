To describe the results of the surgical treatment of patients with congenital arthrogryposis with wrist deformity through biplanar carpal wedge osteotomy. This study analyzed nine patients through a retrospective evaluation with severe deformity in flexion and ulnar deviation of the wrist in the period between January 2004 and December 2009. They were submitted to carpal osteotomy with a biplanar dorsal resection wedge, with a minimum evaluation of 48 months of postoperative evolution. In three patients the osteotomy was bilateral, totalling 12 cuffs analyzed. The indication for the technique described was deformity and stiffness for over six months, without improvement with the conservative treatment. The mean age of the patients on the day of surgery was five years and eight months. The initial mean wrist mobility was 35째, and the joints presented a mean flexion of 72.5째 in a resting position. Osteotomy union occurred in all patients at an average period of 5.7 weeks. The final position of the resting wrist was 12째 of flexion and the mean mobility was 26.6째, slightly lower than preoperatively but in a much better position. No serious complications arising from surgery or in the immediate postoperative period were observed. Carpal osteotomy with biplanar dorsal resection wedge was useful and effective in helping to correct the deformities in flexion and ulnar deviation of the wrist, maintaining a reasonable mobility. It is a preservation surgery, which has low morbidity and avoids the progression of deformity and future degenerative changes.
