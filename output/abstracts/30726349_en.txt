Understanding racial disparities in Brazil has been very complex and poorly investigated in some population segments, such as the elderly individuals. This study aimed to present descriptively a comparative analysis in a racial perspective of sociodemographic profile, health conditions, and health service use by older people in the city of SÃ£o Paulo. This is a cross-sectional analysis of the Health, Welfare and Aging Study (SABE). For this study, 1,345 elderly individuals were considered in the cohort of 2010. Data about the black, brown, and white elders were selected. The data were addressed in three major axes: sociodemographic, health conditions, and health service use. The chosen epidemiological measure of association was the prevalence ratio (PR), as well as the percentage values for expressing differences among the groups. The results showed a more favorable scenario for the aging of the white elderly compared to those of brown or black color, considering sociodemographic indicators, health conditions or use and access to health services.
