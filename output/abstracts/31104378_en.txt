Ventricular septal defects are the most common congenital abnormality diagnosed in children but account for only 10 percent of congenital heart defects in adults. Although many defects close spontaneously before adulthood, many others persist, predisposing to endocarditis, and other complications. Herein, we report a case of a known, asymptomatic, perimembranous ventricular septal defects that has complicated at 53 years of age with the need for surgery due to native aortic valve endocarditis and concomitant severe aortic regurgitation. We opted to surgically repair the ventricular septal defects with a pericardial patch through the necessary aortotomy used for aortic valve replacement (Figure 1 and 2). The surgery was straightforward. Postoperative course was only marked by the need of a permanent pacemaker implantation due to a sick sinus syndrome, which was diagnosed before the surgery. Thus, we emphasize the role of surgery in repairing ventricular septal defects and the importance of choosing the appropriate approach, especially when concomitant heart lesions are present.
