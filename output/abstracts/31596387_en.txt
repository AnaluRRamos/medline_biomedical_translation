To analyze the risk factors associated with the self-reported medical diagnosis of heart disease in Brazil. This is a cross-sectional study, analyzing information from 60,202 adult participants of the Brazilian National Health Survey in 2013. Heart disease was defined by self-reported medical diagnosis of heart disease. We analyzed associations between the occurrence of disease and sociodemographic characteristics, health conditions and lifestyle. A hierarchical binary logistic regression model was used. The prevalence of self-reported diagnosis of heart disease in Brazil was 4.2% (confidence interval of 95% [95%CI] 4.0 ‒ 4.3) and was associated with females (odds ratio [OR] = 1.1; 95%CI 1.1 ‒ 1.1), people 65 years old or older (OR = 4.7; 95%CI 3.3 ‒ 5.6), poor or very poor health conditions (OR = 4.1; 95%CI 3.5 ‒ 4.6) and fair health conditions (OR = 2.4; 95%CI 2.2 ‒ 2.7), hypertensive individuals (OR = 2.4; 95%CI 2.2 ‒ 2.7), those with increased cholesterol (OR = 1.6; 95%CI 1.5 ‒ 1.8), overweight individuals (OR = 1.5; 95%CI 1.4 ‒ 1.8) and obese individuals (OR = 2.0; 95%CI 1.7 ‒ 2.2), sedentary behavior (OR = 1.5; 95%CI 1.02 ‒ 2.1), former smokers (OR = 1.4; 95%CI 1.3 ‒ 1.6) or current smokers (OR = 1.2; 95%CI 1.03 ‒ 1.3) and the consumption of fruits and vegetables 5 or more days each week (OR = 1.5; 95%CI 1.1 ‒ 1.5). The importance of knowledge on the prevalence of heart disease and associated risk factors in the present Brazilian epidemiological context must be emphasized because it guides actions to control and prevent cardiovascular diseases, the leading cause of death in Brazil and worldwide.
