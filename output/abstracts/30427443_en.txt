Contaminated waters constitute health risks not only due to direct consumption, but also in recreational use. Risk analysis strategies aim to reduce the instances of contaminations and must include the population's perceptions and willingness to assume risks. A rapid and simple method was developed to evaluate the probability of use of recreational waters. Interviews were conducted in municipalities with different ecological conditions, in order to define the factors used by people to decide to use, or otherwise, river waters. After analyzing the results, the 'Índice de Probabilidade de Uso Recreativo de Águas (I-PURA)' was elaborated and tested. The index was then employed at 26 river locations representing five of the nine hydrographic regions of Rio de Janeiro state. The frequency of use, water contamination and a Habitat Assessment Visual Index (IAH) was also measured. The I-PURA was correlated with the frequency of use. Furthermore, the I-PURA was not correlated with IAH, showing that user perceptions are different from purely ecological aspects. This tool offers useful information for risk assessment and environmental management. Sites with a high probability of use, or observed use, that are highly contaminated should be prioritized for interventions.
