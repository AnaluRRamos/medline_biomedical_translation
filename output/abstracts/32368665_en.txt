The particular characteristics of oral health care might influence job satisfaction and occurrence of burnout among providers, with consequent impact on their quality of life and the quality of care delivery. In the present study, we analyzed job satisfaction among oral healthcare providers affiliated with the public health service in Sobral, Ceará, Brazil, work-related factors and prevalence of burnout. Cross-sectional study performed in 2017 with 95 oral healthcare providers allocated to primary and secondary care facilities. We administered a sociodemographic questionnaire, the <i>Occupational Stress Indicator scale and the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey</i>. The data were analyzed by means of the χ<sup>2</sup> test; the significance level was set to p<0.05. Job dissatisfaction was associated with precarious working conditions and lack of professional recognition; satisfaction was associated with interpersonal relationships. The overall prevalence of burnout was low (1.05%), however, on subscale analysis 37.9% of the participants exhibited low personal accomplishment and 22.1% high emotional exhaustion. The results for job dissatisfaction and burnout subscales point to the need for more thorough investigation of the working conditions of oral healthcare providers.
