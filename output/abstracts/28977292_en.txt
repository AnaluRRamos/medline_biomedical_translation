To investigate the association between heart rate variability (HRV) parameters with leisure time and commuting physical activities in adolescent boys. The sample included 1152 male adolescents aged 14 to 19 years. The variation of consecutive heart beats (RR intervals) was assessed and HRV parameters in time (SDNN, RMSSD, pNN50) and frequency domains (LF/HF) were calculated. Leisure time and commuting physical activities were obtained using a questionnaire. A binary logistic regression was performed between HRV parameters and physical activity. Leisure time physical activity was associated with SDNN, RMSSD, pNN50, while LF/HF was not associated. These associations were stronger when adolescents were also physically active for more than six months. Commuting physical activity was not associated with any HRV parameter. Boys who practiced commuting physical activity and were also physically active for more than six months presented a lower chance of having low SDNN and RMSSD. Leisure time physical activity was associated with better HRV and these associations were enhanced when adolescents were physically active for more than six months. Commuting physical activity was not associated with HRV parameters; however, it became associated with better HRV when adolescents were physically active in commuting for more than six months.
