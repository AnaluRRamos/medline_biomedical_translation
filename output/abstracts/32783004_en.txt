Motorcycle accidents are a considerable cause of morbidity and mortality in Brazil, with high social and economic costs. Victims are mostly men, young and vulnerable. To characterize motorcycle accident victims and circumstances among patients admitted to a public hospital. We administered a questionnaire to 74 victims of motorcycle accidents in the period from January through July 2018 among patients admitted to a referral hospital for elective orthopedic surgery in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil. Most victims were male (98.4%), up to 31 years old (49%), black or brown (84%) and had low educational level (54%). Motorcycling was the occupation of 50.8%. Drinking was less frequent among motorcyclists in the capital compared to the interior of the state (16 vs. 26%) and a larger proportion had a driving license (72 vs. 39%). Main victims of motorcycling accident victims were male, with low educational level, and without a driving license.
