The objective of this study was to estimate the frequency of regular breakfast consumption (five or more times a week) among adolescents, and to investigate the association with demographic variables, school and job shift, health-related behaviors, eating habits and food consumption. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 30 state schools in Curitiba, State of Paran√°, with the participation of 1,232 adolescents. The prevalence of regular breakfast consumption was 58,6% (95% CI 53,9, 63.2). After adjusted analysis, higher regular breakfast consumption was observed among adolescents who: attended the evening and intermediate/full shifts; performed supervised physical activity; reported sleeping more than eight hours/night; reported having lunch and dinner with the family every day; and took 4 or more meals per day. The weekly frequency of breakfast was associated with higher consumption of milk and dairy products and the lower consumption of instant noodles and soft drinks. It is noteworthy that the habit of eating breakfast was associated with healthy eating practices and habits, reinforcing its values as a marker of other health-related behaviors. Partaking of breakfast should be encouraged among adolescents.
