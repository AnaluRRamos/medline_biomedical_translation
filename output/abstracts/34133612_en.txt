To present the Kaufman Speech Praxis Test for Children - KSPT instrument, as well as its Brazilian cross-cultural adaptation. After obtaining permission to use the KSPT by the copyright holder, and compliance with ethical aspects, the instrument was translated and adapted into Brazilian Portuguese, preserving semantic, idiomatic, experimental and conceptual equivalences, when relevant. After translation and cross-cultural adaptation procedures, there were no changes in Part 1 (Oral movement); in Part 2 (Simple Phonemic and Syllabic Level), 12 test words were excluded and 16 were included; and in Part 3 (Complex Phonemic and Syllabic Level), 13 test words were excluded as they failed to correspond to the characteristics of phonoarticulatory production (phonetic/phonological) in Brazilian Portuguese. In part 4 (Spontaneous Length and Complexity - subjective measure) there were no changes to the English version of the KSPT. After the process, the final version of the material was approved by the author and applied to children for usability and equivalences check. The application to a significant population in Brazil for the construction of psychometric criteria will be carried out at a future stage. The KSPT translation is completed with changes in test words from the application protocol to respect the cross-cultural characteristics of the Brazilian-Portuguese language. Semantic, idiomatic, experimental and conceptual equivalences were respected throughout the application manual, clinical test guide and test statements. This instrument is expected to integrate advances in the diagnosis and monitoring of intervention procedures, effectively contributing to the area.
