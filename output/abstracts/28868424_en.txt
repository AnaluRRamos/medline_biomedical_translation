Recently, it has been suggested an association between red cell distribution width (RDW) and Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI), but its use is not yet performed in daily clinical practice. To determine whether RDW can be used as a marker of Crohn's disease (CD) activity. This was a cross-sectional study including patients with CD, observed consecutively in an outpatient setting between January 1st and September 30th 2013. Blood cell indices, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein were measured. CD activity was determined by CDAI (active disease if CDAI ≥ 150). Associations were analyzed using logistic regression (SPSS version 20). 119 patients (56% female) were included in the study with a mean age of 47 years (SD 15.2). Twenty patients (17%) had active disease. The median RDW was 14.0 (13-15). There was an association between RDW and disease activity (<i>p</i> = 0.044). After adjustment for age and gender, this association remained consistent (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.03-1.39, <i>p</i> = 0.016). It was also found that the association between RDW and disease activity was independent of hemoglobin and ESR (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.08-1.72, <i>p</i> = 0.01) and of biologic therapy (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.03-1.37, <i>p</i> = 0.017). A RDW cutoff of 16% had a specificity and negative predictive value for CDAI ≥ 150 of 88% and 86%, respectively. In this study, RDW proved to be an independent and relatively specific marker of CD activity. These results may contribute to the implementation of this simple parameter, in clinical practice, aiming to help therapeutic decisions.
