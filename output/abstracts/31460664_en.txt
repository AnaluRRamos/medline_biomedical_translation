To investigate the role of the domiciliary situation in the prevalence of general and abdominal obesity through the National Health Survey of 2013. General obesity (body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m2) and abdominal obesity (waist circumference ≥ 102 cm in men and ≥ 88 cm in women) in rural and urban areas were described according to sex and macroregion. Crude and adjusted Poisson regression models were used to test the association between obesity and household situation, with the significance level of 5%. The study included 59,226 individuals. Out of these, 20.7% presented general obesity and 38% abdominal obesity (higher in women: 24.3 and 52%, respectively). The highest prevalences of general obesity were observed in southern urban areas, for both sexes (20.8% in men and 26.5% in women). In rural areas, the highest prevalences were observed for the central-west region (17.2%) in men and in the south region (27.4%) in women. In males, after adjusting for demographic variables, living in rural areas was associated with lower prevalences of general obesity in the North (prevalence ratios - PR = 0.60; confidence interval of 95% - 95%CI 0.40 - 0.89) and Northeast (PR = 0.47, 95%CI 0,38 - 0.59), and for abdominal obesity in all regions. For women in the Midwest, the rural household situation was associated with lower prevalences of obesity. (PR = 1.11, 95%CI 1.01 - 1.23). The results evidenced the role of the domiciliary situation among outcomes at the national level, with lower prevalence of general and abdominal obesity in men living in rural areas. However, higher prevalences were found among women, especially for abdominal obesity.
