To understand the experiences of interaction between teenage mothers and visiting nurses in the Young Mothers Caregivers Program. Qualitative research using the theoretical-methodological framework of Social Phenomenology, with phenomenological interviews with visiting nurses and teenage mothers. Three visiting nurses and nine teenage mothers participated. The understanding of the experiences led to the elaboration of three categories of contexts of meanings related to the past and present: 'Experiences of participation in the PJMC'; 'The interaction experienced by visiting nurses and teenage mothers'; 'Parenting and maternal role'. The interaction between visiting nurses and teenage mothers in the program was characterized as positive, as it provided the mother with greater security in her maternal and parental role. The attitudes of nurses and adolescent mothers were fundamental for establishing a positive interaction.
