This paper aimed to analyze the spatial distribution of older adults' frailty in primary health care, spatially identifying areas with a concentration of seniors, comparing the demand for care. This is an analytical study that employed spatial analysis with older adults who are frail or at risk of frailty enrolled in Primary Health Care, distributed in 32 census tracts. Concerning geolocation, we used Google Earth Pro software and 'C7 GPS Data app', to elaborate the thematic and cadastral maps Qgis 2.16. In total, 43% of seniors were classified as at risk of frailty, of which 79.5% were female, with a mean age of 75 years. The organization of the services showed an unequal distribution of the facilities in the territory, and the three health care settings present or not in some tracts and the concentration of older adults where services were difficult to access. The spatial analysis pointed out the distribution and concentration areas of frailty, favoring the comparison of social vulnerability with the possible care of health services, supporting planning actions and management of the distribution of establishments or projects to visit those in need. Thus, geoinformation tools can strengthen access to health services and provide better living conditions for seniors.
