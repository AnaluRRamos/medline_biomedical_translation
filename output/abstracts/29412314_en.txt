The current study aimed to assess the association between socioeconomic conditions, basic sanitation, and coverage by family health teams and hospitalizations for waterborne diseases. The analysis of socioeconomic conditions and sanitation was based on an ecological study with data from the Brazilian National Household Sample Survey (PNAD) and the Brazilian Health Informatics Departament (DATASUS) database (observations for the States and Federal District) for the year 2013. Associations between family health teams and hospitalization were assessed by simple regressions, with data from DATASUS and the Department of Primary Care of Ministry of Health from 1998 to 2014. Connection to the public sewage system, low schooling, and family health team coverage were significantly associated (p < 0.05) with hospitalizations for waterborne diseases. Based on attributable risk analysis, for Brazil as a whole in 2013, 57,574 (16.3%) of hospital admissions for waterborne diseases could have been avoided by adequate sewage disposal, which would also have avoided BRL 20,372,559.90 in treatment costs and 172,722 days lost to hospitalization. The results emphasize the importance of integrated sanitation policies, education, and health care that consider regional inequalities, thereby contributing to improvement of the population's health conditions.
