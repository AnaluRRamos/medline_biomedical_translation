To report the species identified in candidemia isolated in hospitals in Paraguay, their distribution by age groups, and their susceptibility to fluconazole, voriconazole, and amphotericin B. Retrospective study of candidemia reported to the Central Health Public Laboratory by seven hospitals between 2010 and 2018. Identification and susceptibility testing were performed using the automated Vitek 2<sup>Â®</sup> system. 520 cases of candidiasis were reported. The prevalent species were <i>Candida albicans</i> (34.4%), <i>C. parapsilosis</i> (30.4%), <i>C. tropical</i> (25.4%<i>), C. glabrata</i> (4.8%), and <i>C. krusei</i> (2.1%). Less frequent species were: <i>C. lusitaniae</i> (1.2%), <i>C. guilliermondii</i> (1%), <i>C. famata</i> (0.3%), <i>C. rugous</i> (0.2%), and <i>C. kefyr</i> (0.2%). Candidiasis was most prevalent in the elderly (48.5%) and adults (29.9%). <i>C. parapsilosis</i> was most frequent in newborns and infants, and <i>C. tropical</i> in pediatric patients; 2.8% and 0.6% of <i>C. albicans</i> and 4.4% and 2.5% of <i>C. parapsilosis</i> were resistant, respectively, to fluconazole and voriconazole; 8% of <i>C. glabrata</i> were resistant to fluconazole and two isolations showed a minimum inhibitory concentration for voriconazole greater than 0.25 mg/L. This is the first report on candidemias in hospitals of Paraguay. Together with other studies, it will improve knowledge about this infection in the country.
