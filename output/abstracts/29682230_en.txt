Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive degenerative disorder that negatively affects quality of life of patients and family members. The aim of this study is to compare the cognition, level of physical activity and functioning of elderly individuals with mild AD and those without dementia. The study comprised 24 elderly with mild AD (mean age = 76.9 ± 5.3 years) and 30 elderly without dementia (mean age = 74.1 ± 5.6 years). The following instruments were applied to evaluate cognitive functions: MMSE; Frontal Assessment Battery; Clock Drawing Test; Corsi Blocks, and Verbal Paired Associates. Event-related potential P300 was used to evaluate cognitive processing. The Modified Baecke Questionnaire For Older Adults was applied to evaluate the level of physical activity together with use of a pedometer for 7 consecutive days. For the evaluation of the functioning, the Direct Assessment of Functional Status-Revised scale and functional tests were used. There was a significant difference between the groups in level of physical activity and functioning, except on the test evaluating flexibility. Elderly with AD had cognitive, functional and physical activity deficits which can manifest even in the early stages of the disease.
