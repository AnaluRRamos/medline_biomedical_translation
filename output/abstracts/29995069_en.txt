To produce a reflection on the ability of the V diagram to integrate theoretical, conceptual, and methodological knowledge obtained from complex, non-explicitly identifiable systems, models, and theories. Reflection study with an analytical characteristic. The V Diagram is presented as an instrument that can ensure an integrated analysis between theoretical and conceptual knowledge (worldview and philosophy, theories, principles, constructs, and concepts), and the analysis or production of methodological knowledge (data records, transformations, knowledge assertions, and value assertions). Examples are related to the Unified Health System (SUS), and care in Psychosocial Care Centers for Alcohol and Drugs. V diagram is an instrument capable of producing an integrated analysis of the knowledge contained in productions linked to complex and non-explicitly identifiable models and theories as a theoretical model, theory or framework applying deductive and inductive procedures.
