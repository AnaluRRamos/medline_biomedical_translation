to define the competencies for the prevention and control of healthcare-related infections that should be developed by the generalist nurse and the specialist nurse in infection control in Brazil. the Delphi technique, developed in four rounds, was used. Thirty-one nurses and eight physicians participated in the study, with expertise in infection prevention and control. Data were collected using open-ended questionnaires, whose answers were treated using the content analysis technique. Structured instruments were used to evaluate the importance of each competency using a Likert scale. Data were analyzed and presented in a descriptive way, use of median and coefficient of variation. the competences were organized in 4 core, 14 generic and 17 specific, with name and description of each competency. the definition of competencies for the prevention and control of healthcare-related infections is the first step to begin the rethinking of the teaching and learning process in the initial training of nurses. The data found in the present study may help to restructure education and support permanent education programs in health.
