Lipomas are benign tumors that attack fat cells and most often affecting soft tissues in adulthood. On rare occasions, they may affect bones, preferentially the metaphyses of the long bone. They are generally asymptomatic and radiography shows radiolucent lesions with a thin sclerotic rim or radiodense lesions with a thick sclerotic rim. Malignant transformation of these tumors is rare, as is their recurrence, and there is no need for surgery in most cases. In this report, we present a rare case of intraosseous lipoma in the iliac bone.
