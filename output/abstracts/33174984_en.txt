To evaluate the responsiveness of hearing health services as a measure of user satisfaction. Cross-sectional study conducted in four Specialized Hearing Rehabilitation Centers (SHRC), accredited by the National Health System (SUS) in MaceiÃ³, state of Alagoas, Brazil, henceforth named SHRC-A, -B, -C and -D. The sample size was calculated proportional to the number of users aged >18 years who received hearing aids by SHRC. The Multi-country Survey Study (MCSS) was applied with assessment of seven domains: dignity, autonomy, clear communication, confidentiality, prompt attention, choice of health care provider, and quality basic amenities, using a Likert scale ranging from 1 to 4 points, with results presented in graphs and tables (in number and percentage). Responsiveness classification was as follows: very low/low (sum of responses one and two) and good/very good (sum of responses three and four). 'Dignity' was evaluated as good by over 90% of the respondents, and 'confidentiality' was assessed as good by 80% of them, except for one SHRC. 'Autonomy' was classified as good by 66.5% of the respondents in SHRC-C and 55.5% in SHRC-A. 'Choice of health care provider' was considered poor responsiveness by 27.5% of the respondents in SHRC-B and 35.9% in SHRC-D. Regarding 'prompt attention' in receiving hearing aids, 41.2% of the respondents reported that they had to wait six to nine months in SHRC-D and three to six months in the other SHRC 41.8-48.5%. Most users evaluated the responsiveness of hearing health services as good, but some MCSS domains need improvement. Studies of this nature provide useful results for the planning and reorganization of services, aiming to improve the assistance process.
