to estimate mortality trends for Road Traffic Accidents (RTA) in Goi창nia (2006-2014). this was an ecological study with Mortality Information System data and population data from DATASUS and Goi창nia City Government. We analyzed the time series for mortality from standardized RTA. 3,347 deaths were included. We found significant mortality trends: pedestrians (average percentage annual increment rate - %AIR: -4.7; 95%CI -8.2;-1.1) and automobiles (%AIR: 2.6; 95%CI0.2;5.1) in Goi창nia as a whole, pedestrians (%AIR: -11.3; 95%CI-20.7;-0.8), motorcycles (%AIR -13.5; 95%CI -19.0;-7.7) and automobiles (%AIR: 12.9; 95%CI2.6;24.2) in the city's Southern District, pedestrians (%AIR: -7.8; 95%CI-14.0;-1.2) in the Western District and automobiles (%AIR: -7.4; 95% 95%CI -13.8;-0.5) in the Campinas-Center District. The other time series remained stationary. The RTA mortality rate in Goi창nia as a whole reduced for pedestrians and increased for automobiles. In the city's health districts, the rate reduced for pedestrians/motorcycles and increased for automobiles in the Southern District. The rate reduced for pedestrians and automobiles in the Western and Campinas-Center Districts respectively.
