To evaluate the effect of a clinical management program involving education on hand function in patients with rhizarthritis. One hundred and eight patients with rhizarthritis and multiple arthritis (191 hands with clinical and radiographic rhizarthritis) followed for two years as part of an educational program on osteoarthritis were administered the SF-36, DASH, and HAQ questionnaires and measured for the strength of their palmar grip, pulp to pulp pinch, key (lateral) pinch, and tripod pinch at the time of inclusion and after 24 months. Age, race, level and frequency of physical activity, sex, body mass index, percentage of body fat, and degree of osteoarthritis were correlated to the test outcomes. Women improved less than men on the HAQ (p=0.037). Each 1% reduction in fat percentage increased the chance of HAQ score improvement by 9.2% (p=0.038). Physical activity did not influence improvement in the parameters evaluated (p>0.05). Palmar grip improvement was affected by age and presence of rhizarthritis (p<0.05); patients with unilateral rhizarthritis improved 5.3 times more than patients without the disease (p=0.015), while improvement in palmar grip strength decreased 6.8% per year (p=0.004). Pulp pinch grip strength improved more in women than in men (p=0.018). Patients with rhizarthritis and multiple arthritis improved quality of life and grip strength through clinical treatment, an educational program, and fat loss. <b>Level of Evidence II; Retrospective study.</b>
