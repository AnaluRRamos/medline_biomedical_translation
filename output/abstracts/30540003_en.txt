The aim of this study was to assess the consumption of dietary intake markers in patients with diabetes using a mobile application. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 100 younger and older adult type 2 diabetes patients in treatment in a hospital in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Data was collected using the Diabetes Food Control app. The chi-squared test was used to measure the association between adequate consumption of healthy and unhealthy markers and the variables investigated by the study adopting a 5% significance level. The findings revealed that a high percentage of the respondents were overweight and/or obese and showed inadequate glycemic control. The prevalence of adequate consumption of both healthy and unhealthy diet markers was greatest for the following food groups: fried foods (82%), milk or yogurt (71%), fresh fruit (70%), beans and sugary drinks (68% each item), cookies and sweets (57%), and raw salad (56%). Adequate consumption of unhealthy diet markers was greatest in patients with a family income of less than four minimum salaries, followed by those who did not have high blood pressure. The frequency of consumption of markers was considered adequate for the majority of patients; however, nutritional monitoring is required to correct high blood glucose and HbA1c levels.
