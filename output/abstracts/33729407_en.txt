This article addresses vector, sexual and vertical transmission of Zika virus, a topic covered in the Clinical Protocol and Therapeutic Guidelines for Comprehensive Care for People with Sexually Transmitted Infections, published by the Brazilian Ministry of Health in 2020. Although in Brazil Zika virus is transmitted most predominantly by Aedes aegypti, the vertical and sexual transmission routes are of significant importance for reproductive health. Sexual transmission demands the use of specific prophylactic interventions, including the use of male or female condoms, especially among couples planning pregnancy. Vertical transmission is linked to severe structural abnormalities of the central nervous system and there is still no vaccine or known pharmacological resources that can prevent it. As the disease is predominantly asymptomatic, failure to comply with basic principles of care and guidelines related to the spread of infection transcends the severity of the symptoms of the disease.
