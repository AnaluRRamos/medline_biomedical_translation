An ecological study aimed at analyzing homicide rates and actual bodily harm was conducted in Itaboraí, in the years 2010 to 2011. The entire municipality was used in the study covering critical and non-critical areas. The data came from the Information System for the Public Security Institute in Rio de Janeiro state. The territories were identified and defined by referring to studies on illegal occupations of areas. The snowballing method was used for the social recognition of poor conditions. The morphological differentiation of urban and housing standards marked the locations. The areas were georeferenced, and the problems were located geographically and organized according to their corresponding critical area. We calculated the municipal rates using population estimates from IBGE. For the critical areas, we obtained estimates of the number of households multiplied by a factor equal to the average household density in the corresponding census tract. There was a decrease in homicide rates and a rise in actual bodily harm in Itaboraí. We also found that there was an increased risk of bodily injury in critical areas with the worst living conditions, suggesting the existence of social inequalities that make certain social spaces more vulnerable to incidents involving violent injuries.
