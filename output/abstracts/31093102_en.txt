To characterize the process of health sector reform (HSR) in Peru (launched publicly in 2013), identifying the principal advances in its implementation and the pending challenges from the perspective of the participating actors. This study systematizes experiences through semi-structured interviews conducted with 21 key informants, including three ex-ministers of health, using the decade 2005-2015 as the time frame. Official databases were analyzed to verify variations in health indicators. The proposed reform was based on expanding insurance coverage (predominantly public health insurance), following the structured pluralism model, with clear separation between the functions of delivery, financing, regulation, and governance. The main progress in HSR identified by this study involves: having transcended the poverty criterion for public insurance, strengthening investments in infrastructure and human resources, strengthening the National Health Authority with a focus on the rights of users, and reinforcing the public health role of the Ministry of Health. The main challenges involve providing non-poverty-related insurance coverage for the population, having sufficient specialized human resources, and reducing out-of-pocket expenditure. In the 10 years under analysis, HSR is a process that builds on the progress made in prior years; a process that consolidates an insurance model aimed at universal coverage based on public health insurance and that has led to a demonstrable increase in public spending and population coverage. However, progress has been limited mainly due to insufficient provision of specialized human resources and out-of-pocket expenditure, which remains very high.
