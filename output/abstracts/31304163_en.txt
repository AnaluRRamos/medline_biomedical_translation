To study the insertion of the pectoralis major tendon to the humerus, through knowledge of its dimensions in the coronal and sagittal planes. Twenty shoulders from 10 cadavers were dissected and the pectoralis major tendon insertion on the humerus was identified and isolated. The dimensions of its 'footprint' (proximal to distal and medial to lateral borders) and the distance from the top edge of the pectoralis major tendon to apex of the humeral head structures were measured. The average proximal to distal border length was 80.8 mm (range: 70-90) and the medial-to-lateral border length was 6.1 mm (5-7). The average distance (and range) from the apex of the pectoralis major tendon to the humeral head was 59.3 mm. We demonstrate that the insertion of the pectoralis major tendon is laminar, and the pectoralis major tendon has an average footprint height and width of 80.8 mm and 6.1 mm, respectively.
