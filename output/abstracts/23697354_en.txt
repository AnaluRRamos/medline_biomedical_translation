Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome is a complication of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation during cycles of Assisted Medical Reproduction. The objective of this work was to analyze those cycles to achieve a better knowledge of this pathology, namely risk factors and strategies for prevention and treatment of Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome. Retrospective analysis of 4870 ART cycles (2005 - 2011), with moderate (27) and severe (24) Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome. Data was analyzed for patients' characteristics, stimulation protocol, embryologic and clinical outcomes, and treatment performed. In Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome groups the mean ages and the doses of rFSH + HMG were lower, and the serum E2 levels, doses of HCG, number of oocytes retrieved as well as the rates of blastocyst, biochemical and clinical pregnancy, implantation, newborns, very preterm birth and newborns with low and very low weight were significantly higher. Patients with severe Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome were hospitalized and received only support measures with no complications. Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome is associated with conditions that can bring risk to the fetus, namely prematurity and low birth weight, so the pregnancy should be carefully monitored in these cases. Young age is a risk factor for Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome and high serum E2 levels may predict a higher risk too and thus should induce the adoption of prevention strategies.
