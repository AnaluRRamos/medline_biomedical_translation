Hepatic adenomatosis is defined as the presence of 10 or more adenomas in an otherwise normal liver. Half of the cases are clinically silent and detected incidentally in imaging exams. A 42-year-old woman with previous history of arterial hypertension and mixed dyslipidemia had multiple liver nodules incidentally identified in an abdominal computed tomography scan. She was asymptomatic and her physical examination was unremarkable but laboratory analysis revealed increased alkaline phosphatase and mildly persistent elevated systemic inflammatory markers. A subsequent hepatic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suggested the diagnosis of hepatic adenomatosis and the liver biopsy confirmed the presence of inflammatory adenomas. The patient stopped oral contraception and, at 6 months of follow-up, laboratory inflammatory markers had normalized. She is now under biannual follow-up with MRI and alpha-fetoprotein dosing. This case provides an example of the complex management of this disease in terms of diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up.
