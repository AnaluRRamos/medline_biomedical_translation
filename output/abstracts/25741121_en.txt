In cases where typical aspects are shown, the diagnosis of most frequent hepatic lesions can be made with some safety by means of several imaging methods; on the other hand, uncommon lesions generally represent a diagnostic challenge for the radiologist. In the present second part of the study, the authors describe four rare hepatic lesions, as follows: primary hepatic lymphoma, myofibroblastic tumor, primary hepatic neuroendocrine tumor and desmoplastic small round cell tumor, approaching their main characteristics and imaging findings with emphasis on computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging.
