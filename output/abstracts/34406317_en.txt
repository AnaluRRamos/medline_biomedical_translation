According to the World Health Organization, emerging countries will have an enormous growth in the number of heart attacks and related deaths. The main medical issue in Brazil is mortality caused by acute ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The Society of Cardiology in the State of São Paulo has never trained non-cardiologists as emergency personnel. Patients usually seek help from emergency departments instead of calling for an ambulance. We aimed at reducing in-hospital death rates from acute myocardial infarction by training emergency personnel in the city of Sao Paulo. We used a training program for the personnel of five hospitals with >100 patients admitted with STEMI per year, and at least 15% in-hospital STEMI-associated mortality rate. We performed internet training, biannual-quarterly symposia for up to 400 participants, informative folders and handouts. Statistical analysis used the two proportion comparison test with p <0.05. Nearly 200 physicians and 350 nurses attended at least one training from May 2010 to December 2013. Initially, many emergency physicians could not recognize an acute myocardial infarction on the electrocardiogram, but tele-electrocardiography is used in some emergency departments to determine the diagnosis. The death rate in the five hospitals decreased from 25.6%, in 2009, to 18.2%, in 2010 (p=0.005). After the entire period of training, the STEMI-associated death rate in all public hospitals of São Paulo decreased from 14.31%, in 2009, to 11.25%, in 2014 (p<0.0001). Even simple training programs for emergency personnel can greatly reduce acute myocardial infarction death rates in undeveloped countries.
