Considering the controversial results regarding the relationship between vitamin D levels and bone mineral density in different populations, the present study was designed to evaluate this correlation in a healthy Iranian population. Using a random cluster sample of apparently healthy men and women, this multicenter cross-sectional study was carried out among 4450 individuals living in urban areas of five major cities in Iran. Bone mineral density (BMD) values at different sites were analyzed along with the serum levels of 25(OH)D and PTH. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to estimate the main effects, through comparing the mean values of these markers based on the bone mineral density status of the study group in each sex. 25(OH)D levels were inversely correlated with BMD values at total hip (r = -0.062 in men and r = -0.057 in women) and spine (r = -0.076 in men and r = -0.107 in women). After adjusting the data for age, the inverse correlation was no longer statistically significant. Serum 25(OH)D levels are inversely correlated with bone mass values in both sexes.
