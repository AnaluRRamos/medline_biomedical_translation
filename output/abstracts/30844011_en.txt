The objective of this study was to evaluate factors related to polypharmacy and the use of potentially inappropriate medications (PIM) in elderly patients with diabetes. We studied 127 elderly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, 41 males (age = 69.9 ± 6.9 years) and 86 women (age = 71.1 ± 7.7 years). For evaluation of health conditions, medication use, polypharmacy and associated factors, we used the questionnaire adapted from Morais. The drugs were classified according to the Anatomical Therapeutic-Chemical Classification System, and for identification of MPI, we adopted the criteria of Beers-Fick and PRISCUS. For data analysis, we used descriptive statistics and chi-square and Fisher Exact tests. In this population, 100% of elderly using drugs. The average consumption was 5.8 per individual drug, varying from two to 14, and the prevalence of polypharmacy was 85%. Among the factors studied, only the retirement showed a statistically significant association (p <0.05) with polypharmacy. The most prevalent diseases were hypertension (92.8%), heart problems (70.8%), circulatory (40.8%) and musculoskeletal problems (44.5%). Of drugs used by the elderly, 12 of them were considered potentially inappropriate and 47.2% of the study subjects make use of these medicines regularly. Thus, this study urges new thinking pharmaceutical assistance, as a practical view in full perspective and not meant only as purchasing and dispensing drugs.
