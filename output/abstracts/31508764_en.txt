The purpose of this article is to revisit two authors with the intent to analyze the narratives constructed in two texts. In the first one, the narrative analyzed was the one pertaining to the elaboration of sociological theories in social medicine, and in the second, it was the one related to qualitative research in Health. The macro dimension of narratives, in the sense given by Maines of the possibilities of building a sociology of narratives and a narrative of sociology, will be the object of this study. The texts analyzed were written in the 1980s by JCM Pereira and MCS Minayo.
