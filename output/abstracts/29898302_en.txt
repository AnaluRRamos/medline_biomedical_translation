The quadricuspid aortic valve is a very rare congenital malformation and usually presents with aortic insufficiency. Other associated congenital malformations have been described and particularly coronary anomalies have to be considered and investigated. We report the case of an intraoperatively diagnosed quadricuspid aortic valve in a 70 years old patient and discuss the clinical relevance of this rare congenital malformation.
