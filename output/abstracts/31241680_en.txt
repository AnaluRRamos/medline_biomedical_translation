This research note is the product of a doctoral thesis defended in January 2017 at the University of São Paulo and the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales. It addresses the trajectory of the French geographer Pierre Monbeig in France and Spain, as well as his participation in a French scientific mission to Brazil which helped shape Brazilian geography. This work will be followed by an article which will situate Monbeig's intellectual inheritance within the theoretical landmarks of Brazilian geo-history, comparing and contrasting specific details of the geo-history of Fernand Braudel.
