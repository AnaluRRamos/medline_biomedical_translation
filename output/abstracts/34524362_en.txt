To relate pharyngeal transit time and the presence of residues with dyspnea and lung function in individuals with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease COPD. Study conducted with 19 adults (11 men, 8 women) with a clinical and spirometric diagnosis of COPD and a mean age of 63.8 years (SD = 9.3). Data collection was performed using the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) questionnaire, the modified Medical Research Council scale (mMRC) and a digital manovacuometer, to characterize the impact of the disease on the individual, dyspnea and lung function. The data related to pharyngeal transit time and pharyngeal residue were collected through the analysis of videofluoroscopic images performed by three blinded judges. No significant relationship was found between pharyngeal transit time (PTT) with lung function (r = -0.71), pharyngeal residue and dyspnea (r = -0.06). PTT, when compared to normality, was increased. Individuals with COPD, regardless of the severity of the disease, showed no association between PTT and pharyngeal residue and dyspnea and lung function.
