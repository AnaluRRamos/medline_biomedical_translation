This study aimed to search for scientific evidence published in analytical studies which address elderly workers' retirement postponement factors. An integrative literature review was performed searching for papers in Virtual Health Library (BVS) and SciELO databases from January 2009 to March 2018. Twelve papers were selected following consensus by independent reviewers, generating two categories: National Literature and International Literature. We chose this subject because the phenomenon of population aging entails different social and economic impacts between developed and developing nations, such as Brazil. In the analysis of the results, we found that elderly retirement decision involves a variety of personal, organizational and other factors (legislative, cultural, socio-political, technological). In conclusion, we note scarcity of studies on the subject, with exclusive samples of older adults in both categories, as well as that the greater or lesser relevance of a given factor will depend on the life context of each worker. Moreover, since retirement decision is a dynamic process, there is a shortage of longitudinal studies that need to be met with more robust national surveys of the elderly population.
