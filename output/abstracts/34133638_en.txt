The study aimed to assess the community food environment and the existence of food swamps around schools in a Brazilian metropolis. This was an ecological study in public and private schools in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, with a 250-meter buffer as the analytical unit. The study included all preschool, elementary, and middle schools. In relation to the schools, the study evaluated administrative regimen (public versus private), type of teaching, and per capita income in the schools' census tracts. Information was also compiled on the retail food establishments inside the buffer zone around the schools. The food environment was characterized only according to the establishments around the schools that sold food for immediate consumption. Analysis of the buffers revealed that 97.4% of the schools had at least one establishment in the vicinity that sold food for immediate consumption. The most available establishments around schools were snack bars, restaurants, and bars. Schools located in higher-income census tracts showed higher mean numbers of all establishments in their vicinity, except for grocery stores and supermarkets. In addition, 54.6% of the schools were in neighborhoods classified as food swamps. The results that the among the target categories, there was a predominance of establishments that mainly sell ultra-processed foods such as bars and snack bars in the vicinity of schools in Belo Horizonte, which exposes children and adolescents to an unhealthy food environment.
