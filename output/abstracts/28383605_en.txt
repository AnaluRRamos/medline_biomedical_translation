This study sought to assess the fracture torque resistance of mini-implants used for orthodontic anchorage. Five commercially available brands of mini-implants were used (SIN®, CONEXÃO®, NEODENT®, MORELLI®, andFORESTADENT®). Ten mini-implants of each diameter of each brand were tested, for a total 100 specimens. The mini-implants were subject to a static torsion test as described in ASTMstandard F543. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the Tukey multiple comparisons procedure was used to assess results. Overall, mean fracture strength ranged from 15.7 to 70.4 N·cm. Mini-implants with larger diameter exhibited higher peak torque values at fracture and higher yield strength, regardless of brand. In addition, significant differences across brands were observed when implants were stratified by diameter. In conclusion, larger mini-implant diameter is associated with increased fracture torque resistance. Additional information on peak torque values at fracture of different commercial brands of mini-implants may increase the success rate of this orthodontic anchorage modality.
