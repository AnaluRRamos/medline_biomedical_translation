The aim of this study was to compare virtual reality simulation with other methods of teaching interventional radiology. We searched multiple databases-Cochrane Library; Medline (PubMed); Embase; Trip Medical; Education Resources Information Center; Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature; Scientific Electronic Library Online; and Latin-American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature-for studies comparing virtual reality simulation and other methods of teaching interventional radiology. This systematic review was performed in accordance with the criteria established by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses and the Best Evidence Medical Education (BEME) Collaboration. Eligible studies were evaluated by using the quality indicators provided in the BEME Guide No. 11 and the Kirkpatrick model of training evaluation. After the eligibility and quality criteria had been applied, five randomized clinical trials were included in the review. The Kirkpatrick level of impact varied among the studies evaluated, three studies being classified as level 2B and two being classified as level 4B. Among the studies evaluated, there was a consensus that virtual reality aggregates concepts and is beneficial for the teaching of interventional radiology. Although the use of virtual reality has been shown to be effective for skill acquisition and learning in interventional radiology, there is still a lack of studies evaluating and standardizing the employment of this technology in relation to the numerous procedures that exist within the field of expertise.
