This paper aimed to identify the use of technology and to analyze the cost of hospital care for children and adolescents with medical complex chronic conditions at a public federal hospital specialized in high-complexity pediatric care, and was performed concomitantly with a prospective cohort study conducted over a one-year period. It included 146 patients with complex medical chronic conditions and 37 non-chronic patients. The analysis showed that most patients had, on average, two hospitalizations a year and were diagnosed with diseases related to at least two organic systems. Catheters, drains and gastrostomy were the most common technologies used. Median direct costs of patients with medically complex chronic conditions were higher than those of non-chronic patients when comparing the use of technology. The study shows high hospitalization cost to these patients. Technology use and hospitalization care costs documentation yields more data to support decision-makers in the planning, managing, and financing of pediatric health policies.
