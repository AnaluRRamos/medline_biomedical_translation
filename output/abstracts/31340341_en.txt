to evaluate the efficacy of quality of life questionnaires St. George Respiratory Questionnaire and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Assessment Test in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease based on correlation and agreement analyses, and identify the most effective tool to assess their quality of life. cross-sectional cohort study with patients hospitalized in a Spanish hospital for exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Health-related quality of life was assessed with both questionnaires. The correlation and the agreement between the questionnaires were analyzed, as well as the internal consistency. Associations were established between the clinical variables and the results of the questionnaire. one hundred and fifty-six patients participated in the study. The scales had a correlation and agreement between them and high internal consistency. A higher sensitivity of the Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Assessment Test was observed for the presence of cough and expectoration. the questionnaires have similar reliability and validity to measure the quality of life in patients with acute chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and the Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Assessment Test is more sensitive to detect cough and expectoration and requires a shorter time to be completed.
