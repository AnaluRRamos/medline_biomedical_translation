In a simplistic and succinct way, Liliequist membrane may be understood as a projection formed by an arachnoid membrane extending from the dorsum sellae to the mammillary bodies. In spite of being well known to neurosurgeons, many radiologists neither know this anatomical structure nor give importance to its study. The imaging evaluation of this membrane is feasible and may be interesting for a better preoperative planning; postoperative evaluation of third ventriculostomies; and understanding of suprasellar arachnoid cysts and perimesencephalic hemorrhage. The present article illustrates the anatomy of the membrane, with emphasis on imaging findings, besides describing its possible clinical and surgical implications.
