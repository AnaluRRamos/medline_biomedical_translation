To compare proximal femur radiologic angles in patients with slipped capital femoral epiphysis and to analyze whether computerized tomography may modify the treatment. Cross-sectional study comparing and analyzing the similarity between angles and radiologic classification of interest in slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE). It was observed that the therapeutic management in slipped capital femoral epiphysis might be modified depending on the classification and radiologic acquisition method adopted. Multiplanar assessment of proximal femoral deformity in patients with slipped capital femoral epiphysis is a viable option, with the potential to modify the disease classification and, consequently, the therapeutic management.
