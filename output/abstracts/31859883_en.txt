The aim of this study was to investigate the factors associated with public dental care use by adults in the State of São Paulo, Brazil. A cross-sectional study was conducted with a representative sample of adults aged 35 to 44 years using data from the 2015 Epidemiological Survey of the Oral Health Status of the Population of the State of São Paulo (SBSP-2015). Multivariate logistic regression was performed using variables based on a model proposed by Andersen for predicting access to public dental services. Results: 3,421 (59.9%) adults visited private services and 2,288 (40.1%) visited public services. Prevalence of the use of public dental services was greatest among women (41.8%) and adults with a lower education level (50.2%). Being non-white (OR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.16, 1.50), lower household income (OR = 2.37, 95% CI: 2.11, 2.65), having had toothache (OR = 1.60, 95% CI: 1.39, 1.83), and need for endodontic treatment (OR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.12, 1.85) were associated with public dental service use. Predisposing, enabling, and need factors were associated with public dental care use.
