Papillary carcinoma of the breast is a rare type of breast malignancy, making up less than 2% of breast cancers, and only some are encapsulated papillary carcinoma. Usually, EPC are low-grade luminal like tumors. The authors report a case of a 50-year-old female with the diagnosis of an unusual high-grade triple negative encapsulated papillary carcinoma with an area of invasive papillary carcinoma and negative axillary lymph nodes. Considering its rarity, the description of this case and its clinical management are important in order to better understand this entity and choose the best clinical approach.
