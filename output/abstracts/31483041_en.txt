To develop a game on vocal health and hygiene (VoxPedia) and apply it to adults aiming to investigate knowledge about vocal health and the vocal self-assessment in this population. The study sample was composed of 293 adults, of which 204 were women and 129 were voice professionals, invited to participate through digital media. Participants completed to the following forms and instruments: 1) Informed Consent Form (ICF); 2) Identification Data form; 3) Voice Handicap Index: 10 (VHI-10) protocol; 4) Vocal Health and Hygiene Questionnaire (VHHQ); 5) VoxPedia quiz. The VoxPedia quiz was developed using simple and dynamic questions that allowed the participants to know their performance in real time. Data collected through this quiz showed that voice professionals reported reduced voice handicap and had higher scores in the VHHQ and VoxPedia. Voice professionals or not, participants who answered wrongly to the nature of impact of health aspects in the VHHQ reported increased voice handicap in the VHI-10; however, despite the self-reported handicap, most of them did not report voice complaints. In contrast, when voice complaints were reported, the participants not always perceived handicap or searched for vocal therapy. The VoxPedia quiz presented some concepts on vocal health and hygiene to the participants. In addition, it enabled the study of the relation between knowledge about vocal care and voice self-assessment. The data suggest that individuals with greater knowledge about vocal health and hygiene show better voice self-assessment, those with worse voice self-assessment do not perceive voice problems, and those who perceive voice problems do not necessarily seek professional assistance.
