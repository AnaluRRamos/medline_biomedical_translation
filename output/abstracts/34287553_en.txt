To assess vaccination coverage, based on the National Immunization Program schedule, among children receiving financial support from the Family Income Transfer Program, Brazil, according to the family socioeconomic status and maternal characteristics. 3,242 children under 12 months old were assessed between August/2018 and April/2019, of whom 3,008 were reassessed between September/2019 and January/2020. The analyses were performed using multilevel models (level 3, Federative Unit; level 2, municipality; level 1, children). Vaccination coverage was 2.5 fold higher in the first follow-up (61.0% - 95% CI 59.3;62.6%), compared to the second follow-up (24.8% - 95% CI 22.8;25.9%) (p<0.001). In the first follow-up, coverage was higher in the richest quintile (67.9%) and in children whose mothers had â‰¥9 years of schooling (63.3%). In the second follow-up, there were no differences. The highest coverage occurred between 0.5-2.5 (93.5%) and 12.5-15.5 months (34.4%), respectively, first and second follow-ups. Low coverage was found, both in the first and second year of life.
