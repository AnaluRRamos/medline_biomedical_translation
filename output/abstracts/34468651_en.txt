The structure and performance of medical and dental care were analyzed in two health regions that differed socioeconomically and in the provision of services, through case study in the Norte-Barretos (SÃ£o Paulo) and Juazeiro (Bahia) regions from 2007 and 2014, taking into account political, organizational and structural dimensions and structure and performance indicators. The results showed that the regionalization was positively recognized, the distribution of services did not meet the population demand, and the installed capacity of the health care network was not adequate for the health needs of the population. Norte-Barretos stood out regarding structure (except for potential coverage of oral health teams in the Family Health Strategy) and effectiveness, while Juazeiro stood out concerning efficiency; e.g. although with fewer resources, the use of services was relatively higher. The observed pattern seems to reflect aspects related to the regionalization and the political path of each care provided, the so-called 'silos effect'. The results may support the design of health policies aimed at overcoming the undersized structure of public health services in regions of lower socioeconomic development and search for parameters and coordination mechanisms to balance performance indicators better.
