This article discusses the results of research-intervention based on the clinical psychosocial approach conducted among young Brazilian and French rappers between 13 and 27 years of age. Our objective is to analyze the function of rap, as artistic mediation, for the young inhabitants of disadvantaged urban areas. The field research was performed on the basis of participant observation and interviews in both countries. Our analyses show that rap is used by youths to reflect upon the world around them and to react to the negative representations and social imagery with which they are associated, seeking recognition of a positive place in society. Through this artistic expression they become able to accomplish new social and subjective experiences on the social scene. Rap is also a support for the formation of peer groups and social bonds among young inhabitants of different suburbs of the world. In this way, this study seeks to contribute to the discussion surrounding the collective and singular dimension of health practices, thereby constituting a research clinic that does not limit itself to standard technical procedures or to biologically-based scientific knowledge.
