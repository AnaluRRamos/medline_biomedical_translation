Individuals suffering from chronic kidney disease (CKD) are often on multiple medications, which exposes them to drug-related problems (DRP). There are no available tools in Brazil to assess the pharmacotherapy and management of DRPs systematically in this population. The scope of this study was to perform a cross-cultural adaptation of PAIR criteria (Pharmacotherapy Assessment in Chronic Renal Disease) to Brazilian Portuguese. PAIR criteria consist of 50 DRP clinically significant items for CKD. The process of cross-cultural adaptation involved translation, synthesis, back-translation, and an analysis by an expert committee as well as a pre-test of the first draft document. A review committee consisting of 2 pharmacists and 2 nephrologists analyzed the semantic, linguistic, experiential, and conceptual equivalence between the original and translated versions. All items that obtained a score below 80% were reviewed. Word adjustments were made, as well as the exclusion of 6 DRP due to non-applicability to the Brazilian context. Thus, the final version of PAIR defined as 'Avaliação da farmacoterapia na doença renal crônica' was translated and adapted into the Brazilian Portuguese language.
