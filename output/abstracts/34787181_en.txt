The scope of this article is to evaluate the potentialities of indicators of the nutritional status of iodine in individuals or populations. The review was based on PRISMA. The search for articles occurred in January 2019, in the Pubmed, Scopus and LILACS databases, using the key words: indicators AND nutritional status AND iodine. The selection followed the stages of excluding the duplicates, reading the titles, abstracts and analyses in full. The methodological quality of the studies was evaluated by the Downs and Black instrument. A total of 178 studies were identified and 20 were included. Urinary Iodine Concentration (UIC) was analyzed in 65% of the studies and was considered the best indicator to evaluate the nutritional status of iodine in the population. Thyroglobulin was determined in 20% of the studies and reflected the pre-existing state of iodine. Thyroid stimulating hormone was verified in 45% of the articles and was important for the surveillance of iodine deficiency among newborns. Only one study evaluated capillary iodine, useful for analyzing long-term dietary intake. In the evaluation of methodological quality, the lowest score was 12 and the highest 16, in 17 possible points. The use of UIC is recommended for the diagnosis of deficiency and excess of iodine in the population.
