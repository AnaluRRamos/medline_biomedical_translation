The aim of this study was to assess the impact of oral conditions on the oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) of early adolescents aged 11 to 14 years in the rural population of a Brazilian municipality. Adolescents attending public schools in the municipality participated in the study. OHRQoL was measured using the short Brazilian version of the Child Perceptions Questionnaire (CPQ11-14) with four domains: oral symptoms, functional limitations, emotional wellbeing and social wellbeing. A higher score indicates a more negative perception of the adolescent regarding his/her OHRQoL. Oral conditions such as dental caries, malocclusion and dental trauma were evaluated using DMTF index, Dental Aesthetics Index (DAI) and Andreasen criteria, respectively. The variables sex and age, number of siblings, parents' schooling, family monthly income, number of times of tooth-brushing/day and visits to the dentist/year were also evaluated. Descriptive analysis and regression models were performed. Of the 202 participants, 94 (46.5%) were female and 108 (53.5%) were male. Adolescents from low-income families (p=0.042) and with more severe malocclusion (p=0.037) scored higher in the CPQ11-14. Those with severe malocclusion scored higher in the emotional wellbeing domain (p=0.009). Females scored higher than males in the oral symptoms domain (p=0.002). Adolescents from low-income families scored higher in the social wellbeing domain (p=0.006). Malocclusion negatively affected the OHRQoL of adolescents from a Brazilian rural area, mainly regarding emotional wellbeing. Negative repercussions were also observed among females and adolescents whose families had lower income.
