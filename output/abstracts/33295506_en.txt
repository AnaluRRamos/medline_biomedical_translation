The present study analyzed the profile of publications related to the health of the older adults in the Journal Ciência & Saúde Coletiva, in terms of quantitative evolution, methodological approach, thematic and institutions involved. The selection of articles considered the title, abstract and descriptors and covered all the content published between 1996 and 2019. The articles included were classified according to the year of publication, type, theme, methodological approach and institutional link of the first author. Data analysis was based on absolute and relative frequencies, in addition to summary (mean) and variability (standard deviation) measures. The results showed a consistent increase in publications on the health of the older adults in the Journal Ciência & Saúde Coletiva, with a predominance of the quantitative approach, mainly focused on investigating the topic related to health conditions and the use of health services and supplies. In the majority, the main author was linked to a public teaching/research institution, located in the Southeast region. The results indicate that the journal contributed to give greater visibility to the health of the older adults, but that the publications on this theme reproduce the inequality observed in the national scientific production.
