Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a minimally invasive organ-sparing endoscopic technique which allows <i>en bloc</i> resection of premalignant and early malignant lesions of the gastrointestinal tract regardless of size. In spite of the promising results, mainly from Japanese series, ESD is still not being widely used in western countries. This study aims to report the feasibility, safety and effectiveness of ESD technique for treating premalignant and early malignant gastrointestinal (GI) lesions (esophagus, gastric and rectum) in a Portuguese center. From December 2011 to November 2014, 34 GI lesions were treated by ESD. The location, en bloc and pathological complete resection (R0) rates, procedure time, complications and local recurrence were retrospectively evaluated. From 34 resected lesions, 18 were gastric (GL), 15 were rectal (RL) and one esophageal (EL). En bloc resection for each location was 17/18 (94%), 11/15 (73%) and 1/1 respectively. R0 was achieved in 16/18 (89%) GL, 9/15 (60%) RL and 1/1 EL. Mean resection time was 67 min for GL, 142 min for RL and 40 min for EL. Complications included immediate (6%) and delayed (3%) minor bleeding but no perforation. One local residual lesion from a RL was reported in the follow-up, effectively treated with an endoscopic technique. Disease-specific survival was 100% over a mean follow-up period of 14 months. ESD has shown to be a safe and feasible resection method, achieving high R0, low recurrence and complication rates. Our results are similar to those reported in other international series.
