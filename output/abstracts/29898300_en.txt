Paget-Schröetter Syndrome, or effort thrombosis of the subclavian vein, is an uncommon condition that affects young, active, healthy individuals. It's a type of Thoracic Outlet Syndrome (TOS), consequence of compression and repetitive injury of the subclavian vein, between the first rib and the clavicle. This paper reports the case of a 27 year-old female presenting with an acutely swollen right upper limb, with no history of trauma or repeated movement of right arm, taking oral contraceptive pills and no history of venous thromboembolic disease. Duplex ultrasound evaluation confirmed right subclavian venous thrombosis with no evidence of cervical rib or other structural abnormalities, diagnosing Paget-Schröetter Syndrome. Following anticoagulation, catheter directed thrombolysis and balloon angioplasty were performed, with no success due to external compression. Therefore, after the correction of the external compression through first rib resection, the luminal flow was restored and the venous obstruction symptoms disappeared. In these case, a prompt treatment was critical for the achievement of the best results.
