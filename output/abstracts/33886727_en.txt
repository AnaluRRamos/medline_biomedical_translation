A major cause of death worldwide, cardiovascular diseases and their prevalence in cardiologists are little known. To describe life habits and cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) and to investigate the prevalence of diagnosis, awareness, and control of these CVRF among cardiologists members affiliated to and specialists from the Brazilian Society of Cardiology. National multicenter cross-sectional study to assess Brazilian cardiologists using a questionnaire on life habits, preexisting diseases, current medications, anthropometric measurements, blood pressure, and levels of glucose and lipids. A total of 555 cardiologists were evaluated, of which 67.9% were male, with a mean age of 47.2Â±11.7 years. Most were non-smoker (88.7%) and physically active (77.1%), consumed alcohol (78.2%), had normal weight circumference (51.7%), and were overweight (56.1%). The prevalence of systemic arterial hypertension (SAH), diabetes mellitus (DM), and dyslipidemia (DLP) were 32.4%, 5.9%, and 49.7%, respectively, of which only 57.2%, 45.5%, and 49.6%, respectively, were aware of the diseases. The Brazilian cardiologists participating in the study had a high prevalence of SAH, DM and DLP, but only a half of participants were aware of these conditions and, among these, the rates of controlled disease were low for SAH and DLP, although cardiologists are professionals with great knowledge about these CVRF. These findings represent a warning sign for the approach of CVRF in Brazilian cardiologists and encourage the conduction of future studies.
