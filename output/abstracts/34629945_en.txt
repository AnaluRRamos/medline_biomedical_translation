The plantar pressure distribution can be assessed quantitatively by computerized baropodometry such as carpet or insole. An insole-type system with wireless transmission was developed and plantar pressure results were previously validated by force platform. However, the reproducibility of the system had not been determined. Our objective was to evaluate the reliability of the results in different gait cycles, clinical characteristics and in different plantar anatomical sites. 41 healthy adults (age, 34 ± 13 years; body mass index, 25 ± 5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; 26 [63%], male, 26 [63%] practicing physical activity) were evaluated. Baropodometer evaluations were performed in 3 walking cycles with 100 m each, and the reliability between the cycles was examined. Pressure points on the heel, first metatarsal, fifth metatarsal and total plantar pressure were analyzed and compared. Moderate agreement was identified between the second and third cycles (ICC, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.14-0.83). Physical activity practitioners showed higher total plantar pressure (70.8 vs 68.2 Kpa; p = 0.04) and higher pressure in the heel (70.7 vs 68.1 Kpa; p = 0.036) in relation to sedentary ones. The insole was able to assess plant pressure with moderate reliability from the adaptation period. <b><i>Level of Evidence III, Case control study - Investigating a diagnostic test.</i></b>
