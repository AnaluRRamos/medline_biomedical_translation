The study aimed to investigate the prevalence and duration of work absenteeism due to voice disorders in Brazilian schoolteachers and the association with work-related factors and health status. This was a cross-sectional study with a representative sample of 6,510 female and male schoolteachers in basic education, from October 2015 to March 2016. The dependent variable was the teacher's report of some work absence due to a voice problem in the previous 12 months. The independent variables related to work conditions and health status. A descriptive analysis was performed of the prevalence and duration of work absences due to voice problems. The association between the target event and the other variables was measured as the prevalence ratio with 95% confidence intervals, using Poisson regression. The main reason for teachers missing classroom work was voice disorders (17.7%), and most absences (78%) were short (seven days or less). In the final multivariate model adjusted by gender, higher prevalence of absence due to voice disorders was associated with schoolteachers in the North and Northeast of Brazil, longer time commuting to and from work, self-report of occupational disease, visit to health services, and report of psychological and respiratory problems during the same 12-month period. There was a high prevalence of short work absences due to voice problems, associated with comorbidities. Macrostructural factors suggest the social nature of the illness process and work absenteeism in Brazilian schoolteachers.
