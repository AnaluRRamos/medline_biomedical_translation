This work uses a field survey to analyze a plenary session of the Rio de Janeiro Legislative Assembly entitled 'Humanized childbirth and the right to choose.' Understanding this as a political space for conflicts of knowledge pertaining to the areas of medicine, nursing, and legislature, we consider the content of this session and discourses of power/knowledge surrounding the female body and reproduction. The article explores tensions around the political struggle for 'humanized childbirth' via demands made by the Regional Council of Nursing. We also address the history of the medicalization of childbirth and the role of nurses, professionals specialized in low-risk births (obstetrizes), and midwives in this process.
