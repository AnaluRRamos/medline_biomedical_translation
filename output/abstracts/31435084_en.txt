To determine the size of the ischiofemoral space (IFS) and quadratus femoris space (QFS) in patients with and without ischiofemoral impingement (IFI). Case-control study including consecutive patients submitted to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the hip joint during a three-month period. Patients with deep gluteal pain who tested positive for IFI on at least one clinical test and showed signal changes in the quadratus femoris muscle on MRI were categorized as having a confirmed diagnosis of IFI. Final sample comprised 50 patients submitted to unilateral MRI of the hip joint. The mean age was 47.3 ± 14.0 years (range, 22-76 years), and 33 (66%) of the patients were women. A diagnosis of IFI was made in 6 patients (12%), all of whom were female. On average, IFS and QFS were significantly smaller in IFI group than in control group (11.1 ± 2.7 mm versus 27.5 ± 6.5 mm and 5.3 ± 1.8 mm versus 18.8 ± 4.8 mm, respectively; <i>p</i> < 0.001 for both). Results of specific clinical tests and MRI findings indicate that the IFS and QFS are significantly reduced in patients with IFI.
