To study the impact of delayed admission by more than 4 hours on the outcomes of critically ill patients. This was a retrospective observational study in which adult patients admitted directly from the emergency department to the intensive care unit were divided into two groups: Timely Admission if they were admitted within 4 hours and Delayed Admission if admission was delayed for more than 4 hours. Intensive care unit length of stay and hospital/intensive care unit mortality were compared between the groups. Propensity score matching was performed to correct for imbalances. Logistic regression analysis was used to explore delayed admission as an independent risk factor for intensive care unit mortality. During the study period, 1,887 patients were admitted directly from the emergency department to the intensive care unit, with 42% being delayed admissions. Delayed patients had significantly longer intensive care unit lengths of stay and higher intensive care unit and hospital mortality. These results were persistent after propensity score matching of the groups. Delayed admission was an independent risk factor for intensive care unit mortality (OR = 2.6; 95%CI 1.9 - 3.5; p < 0.001). The association of delay and intensive care unit mortality emerged after a delay of 2 hours and was highest after a delay of 4 hours. Delayed admission to the intensive care unit from the emergency department is an independent risk factor for intensive care unit mortality, with the strongest association being after a delay of 4 hours.
