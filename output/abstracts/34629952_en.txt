To evaluate the functional results after the use of extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) in four groups of patients: tendinopathy, partial rotator cuff injury, adhesive capsulitis and calcareous tendinopathy of the rotator cuff at one month and three months after the end of treatment. Case series in which patients were evaluated according to the VAS of pain, range of motion of the shoulder, and functional questionnaires DASH and modified UCLA. There was a significant increase in the measure of flexion, lateral rotation and shoulder abduction in the evaluations after treatment in relation to the baseline measurement (p < 0.001) and no evidence of significant difference was found between the post-treatment evaluations at one month and three months follow-up (p > 0.05). There was a significant reduction in the VAS score, increase in the UCLA score and a significant reduction in the DASH score in the post-treatment evaluations in relation to the baseline score (p < 0.001) and a significant improvement in the three-month evaluation in relation to one month (p < 0.05). Extracorporeal shockwave therapy proved to be efficient and safe in the treatment of shoulder pathologies, improving pain, range of motion and functional scores in all groups of patients evaluated in the study. <b><i>Level of Evidence IV, Case series.</i></b>
