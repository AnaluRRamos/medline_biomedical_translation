To assess the effect of chronic alcohol consumption on the longitudinal growth of the tibia and bone quality parameters in young rats under an experimental setup. The control (n=10) rats received only water. The ethanol (n=10) rats received ethyl alcohol at concentrations established in the protocol for the induction of chronic alcohol consumption. The blood samples were immediately collected via cardiac puncture and processed to evaluate the levels of alkaline phosphatase by automated spectrophotometry. Following blood sample collection, both tibias were dissected, and weighed; the tibial length was measured., and the samples were stored in a freezer for future analysis of the bone mineral content and mechanical resistance, known as maximal load and stiffness. Compromised bone health, with a 35.3% decrease in the serum alkaline phosphatase levels (p < 0.01), a 10% decrease in the tibial mass (p < 0.05), and a 5.3% decrease in the tibial length (p < 0.0001) were noted. Furthermore, a 10% decrease in the bone mineral density was observed (p < 0.01), which led to a 17.2% decrease in the maximum strength (p < 0.01) and 22.6% decrease in stiffness (p < 0.001). Chronic consumption of alcohol affected the bones of young rats, making them weaker and osteopenic. In addition, the long bones were shorter, suggesting interference with growth. <b><i>Level of Evidence III, Case Control Study.</i></b>
