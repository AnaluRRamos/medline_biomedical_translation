To evaluate the accuracy of steady-state free precession (SSFP) unenhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) at 1.5 T for the identification of multiple renal arteries, using computed tomography angiography (CTA) as the reference standard. This was a prospective study involving 39 patients (26 males; mean age, 62.6 years) who underwent CTA and unenhanced MRA to evaluate the proximal and middle segments of the renal arteries. The analysis was performed in two phases: the quality of unenhanced MRA images was classified as diagnostic or nondiagnostic for the presence of multiple renal arteries by two independent readers; two other independent readers then evaluated the images previously classified as being of diagnostic quality. The sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of unenhanced MRA were calculated, CTA being used as the reference standard. The kappa statistic was used in order to calculate interobserver agreement. The image quality of unenhanced MRA was considered diagnostic in 70-90% of the extrarenal arterial segments. The CTA examination revealed 19 multiple renal arteries (8 on the right and 11 on the left). The accuracy of unenhanced MRA for the identification of multiple renal arteries was greater than 90%, with a sensitivity of 72.7-100% and a specificity of 96.3-100%. Unenhanced MRA provides high quality imaging of the extrarenal segments of renal arteries. This method may be used as an alternative for the evaluation of the renal arteries, given that it has an accuracy comparable to that of CTA.
