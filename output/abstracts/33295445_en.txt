Few studies have discussed the reasons for pharmacological undertreatment of Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS). To determine the frequency and reasons for the non-administration and suspension of medications during in-hospital treatments of ACS in the Strategy of Registry of Acute Coronary Syndrome (ERICO) study. The present study analyzed the medical charts of the 563 participants in the ERICO study to evaluate the frequency and reasons for the non-administration and/or suspension of medications. Logistic regression models were built to analyze if sex, age ≥65 years of age, educational level, or ACS subtype were associated with (a) the non-administration of ≥1 medications; and (b) the non-administration or suspension of ≥1 medications. The significance level was set at 5%. This study's sample included 58.1% males, with a median of 62 years of age. In 183 (32.5%) participants, ≥1 medications were not administered, while in 288 (51.2%), ≥1 medications were not administered or were suspended. The most common reasons were the risk of bleeding (aspirin, clopidogrel, and heparin), heart failure (beta blockers), and hypotension (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers). Individuals aged ≥65 (odds ratio [OR]:1.51; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]:1.05-2.19) and those with unstable angina (OR:1.72; 95% CI:1.07-2.75) showed a higher probability for the non-administration of ≥1 medication. Considering only patients with myocardial infarction, being ≥65 years of age was associated with both the non-administration and the non-administration or suspension of ≥1 medication. Non-administration or suspension of ≥1 medication proved to be common in this ERICO study. Individuals of ≥65 years of age or with unstable angina showed a higher probability of the non-administration of ≥1 medication and may be undertreated in this scenario.
