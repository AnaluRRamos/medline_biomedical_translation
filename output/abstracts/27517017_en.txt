To evaluate the relationship between patients' body mass index (BMI) and the degree of radiographic severity of knee osteoarthrosis. 117 patients with gonarthrosis were evaluated prospectively. The patients' BMI was calculated and their knee arthrosis was classified in accordance with the modified Ahlbäck criteria. Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate the relationship between these two variables. The group classified as Ahlbäck grade V had significantly higher BMI than the others. There is a direct relationship between BMI and the degree of radiographic severity of gonarthrosis. Obesity appears to be directly related to the progression of knee osteoarthrosis.
