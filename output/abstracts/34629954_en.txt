The presence of abnormalities in knee alignment (genu varum and genu valgum) is extremely common in soccer. It can occur in the junior league / youth academy and perpetuate itself throughout the professional career. The consequences of years of high-level sports practice in players with genu varum / genu valgum can be harmful to the knees. By observing football matches of the present and the past, the authors of the article noted that great Brazilian soccer players were, or are, affected by the malalignment of the knees: Garrincha (the most famous), Leandro, Dunga, Rom√°rio, Rivaldo and Neymar. This study aims to discuss the relationship between high-performance sport and the development of these orthopedic deformities, serving as a tool for updating the trauma-orthopedic knee subspecialty. <b><i>Level of Evidence III, Retrospective comparative study.</i></b>
