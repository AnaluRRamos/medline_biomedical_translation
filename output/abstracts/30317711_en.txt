Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) remains a relevant cause of mortality in Western countries. There is a need for continuous identification of risk factors for aneurysmal progression and predictors of treatment response to optimize the therapeutic strategy to be offered to these patients. Vascular calcification has been studied in several capillary beds as a cardiovascular risk factor. However, the importance of abdominal aortic calcification (AC) in AAA remains incompletely clarified, and the available evidence is scattered and heterogeneous. The objective of this review is to describe the possible impact of AC on aneurysmal progression and rupture, as well as on the response to endovascular correction. It should be noted that the establishment of a validated, quick and easy to use method for assessing AC would be of great clinical and/or research utility.
