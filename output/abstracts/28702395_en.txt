This study aims to analyze the anatomical and radiological characteristics of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients with surgical indication. Retrospective, descriptive study of 100 medical records pertaining to patients included in the group of scoliosis with surgical indication from the years 2008 to 2015. Descriptive statistics were used for statistical analysis. 28 patients met the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and were selected for the study. The average age was 15.4 (SD ± 1.2 years); in the selected sample, the female/male ratio was 6:1; the kyphosis measured in degrees by Cobb angle between T5-T12 had an average 32.10 (SD ± 13.37); according to the Lenke classification, the most prevalent type was type 2, representing 28.6% of cases. The mean patient age in the present study was 15.4 (SD ± 1.2 years); the most prevalent type was type 2 in the Lenke classification. There is a need for new anatomical and radiological studies to elucidate the morphological characteristics common in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients.
