To compare preoperative and early postoperative levels of psychosocial distress in patients undergoing bone metastasis treatment with endoprosthesis, evaluating its impact on quality of life. Thirteen patients undergoing endoprosthetic treatment of bone metastasis were assessed at two time points: preoperatively and 30 days postoperatively. The tool used was the Distress Thermometer, a questionnaire for psychosocial screening developed by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. Distress is considered moderate or severe if the patient scores 4 or higher. The most frequent problems in the preoperative period were 'bathing and dressing'. At 30 days, 'fatigue' and 'nervousness' prevailed. There was a significant improvement in distress when preoperative and 30-day assessments were compared. The surgical treatment of bone metastasis with endoprosthesis results in an early improvement of psychosocial distress as measured by the Distress Thermometer. <b><i>Level of evidence II, Prospective and comparative therapeutic study.</i></b>
