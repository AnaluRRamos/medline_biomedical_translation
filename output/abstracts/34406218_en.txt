Exploratory, descriptive, analytical, and documentary study that used the Statistical Overview of Higher Education - Undergraduate Courses, of the Brazilian National Institute for Educational Studies and Research 'An√≠sio Teixeira', which is part of the Ministry of Education and Culture, as a source of secondary data for the period between 2009 and 2018. There was a growth in the number of undergraduate Nursing courses and new seats in the distance education modality. However, only 8.89% of these seats were occupied and 3.39% of the enrolled students completed the course, which accounted for 0.30% of the new seats. The expansion of undergraduate Nursing courses is aligned with the general trends in higher education.
