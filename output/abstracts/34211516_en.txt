The presence of malperfusion syndrome in cases of complicated acute type B aortic dissection is a negative predictive factor and urgent intervention is indicated. Anatomic variations, such as the Arc of Buhler, contribute anastomotic channels and can preserve the visceral blood supply. In this case report, we describe the overall management of a 54-year-old man who presented with a type B aortic dissection. Initially, conservative management was chosen, as indicated for an uncomplicated type B dissection, but the dissection deteriorated. Despite the fact that severe occlusion of the celiac artery was detected on Computed Tomography (CT) angiography, the Arc of Buhler anatomical variation was present, contributing adequate visceral blood supply. After considering this finding, the patient was treated effectively with thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR).
