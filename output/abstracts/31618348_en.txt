To evaluate the medical knowledge regarding the application of the diagnostic criteria for brain death and to correlate it with training parameters for this diagnosis according to Federal Council of Medicine resolution 2,173 of 2017. We interviewed 174 physicians with experience with comatose patients. A structured questionnaire adapted from previous studies was used. The associations of the variables were tested using the chi-square test for independence. A multivariate logistic model was fitted for associations with p values â‰¤ 0.20. Among the interviewees, 40% had been working for more than 1 year in intensive care, and 23% had initiated ten or more brain death protocols complying with the new resolution. Forty-five percent of the interviewees reported having difficulty following the criteria, 94% acknowledged the need for complementary tests for diagnosis, and 8% of them reported the existence of incorrect tests. The difficulty with these criteria decreased with an increase in the number of years of medical training (OR = 0.487; p = 0.045; 95%CI 0.241 - 0.983) and with a higher number of initiated brain death protocols (OR = 0.223; p = 0.0001; 95%CI 0.117 - 0.424). Difficulties in the application of brain death criteria were identified by a significant portion of the sample. However, among other factors, more years of training and a greater number of initiated brain death protocols were associated with greater ease in the application of brain death criteria according to the guidelines provided in Resolution 2,173 of the Federal Council of Medicine.
