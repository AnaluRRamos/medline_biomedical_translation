To examine the association between factors involved in job insecurity and: health service use, tobacco use, and alcohol use among salaried workers and contract workers in Bolivia. A cross-sectional study was performed with a sample of workers composed of 1203 women and 1780 men between the ages of 14 and 65 years using data from Bolivia's 2015 Household Survey. The dependent variables were health service use, tobacco use, and alcohol use; the independent variables were wages, type of contract, work hours, and exercise of workers' rights. Prevalence rates were calculated and the association between factors involved in job insecurity and the dependent variables was assessed using multivariate binomial regression models with adjustment for sociodemographic variables. The analyses were stratified by sex. The adjusted models showed a significant association between working under a temporary contract and lower use of health services among men (odds ratio [OR]: 0.70; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.56-0.87) and women (OR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.46-0.82). Poor exercise of workers' rights was also associated with lower use of health services (OR: 0.61; IC 95%: 0.45-0.83) among men. Long work hours showed an association with greater use of alcohol among women (OR: 1.75; 95% CI: 1.34-2.29). Low wages were associated with lower tobacco use among men (OR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.57-0.99) and women (OR; 0.57; 95% CI: 0.33-0.99). However, being a manual worker was associated with tobacco use (OR: 1.36; 95% CI: 1.09-1.70) among men. Having a temporary contract and belonging to income quintile I (the poorest) are both associated with lower use of health services and lower probability of smoking in individuals of either sex. Long work hours are associated with greater alcohol use among women. Poor exercise of workers' rights is associated with lower use of health services among men.
