Objective of this article is to evaluate aspects related to the services provided in SUS pharmacies in Brazil, according to users' perception. Data from the National Survey of Access, Use and Promotion of Rational Use of Medicines carried out between 2013 and 2014 were used. Individuals who obtained drugs from public pharmacies were analyzed. To calculate prevalence estimates, the total number of users of drugs with 95%CI was used as denominator. From the age group of 20 to 24 years up to 60 to 64 years, there were significant differences between men and women in terms of use of public pharmacies. More than 30% of people from all socioeconomic classes who did not obtain drugs from SUS pharmacies never thought about this possibility. Not having to wait much time to obtain the medication and a positive evaluation of the opening hours had a strong association with the positive evaluation of users of SUS pharmacies. Opening hours and waiting time are potential barriers in SUS pharmacies. The evaluation of users of SUS was positive, but it pointed to regional differences, and the identification of the magnitude of such differences can contribute to the planning of more effective and equitable policies.
