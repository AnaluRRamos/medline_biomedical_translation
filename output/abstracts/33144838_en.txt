To evaluate clinically and radiologically the long-term follow-up of patients with anteromedial osteoarthritis who underwent unicompartmental knee arthroplasty surgery. This study included 36 patients who underwent unicompartmental knee arthroplasty surgery for medial compartmental osteoarthritis with a minimum of 15-year post-operative follow-up. All surgeries were performed by a single surgeon (G.L.C) using the Miller-Galante unicompartmental knee implant. Patients were analyzed regarding their clinical functional and implant radiographic conditions. From the 46 patients who could have completed 15 years of follow-up, three required revision surgery with conversion to total knee arthroplasty (6.5%), 36 completed the 15-year follow-up period, and the others were lost to follow-up for reasons not related to unicompartmental arthroplasty. In these 36 patients, the result was satisfactory after follow-up, with complaints and sign of progression of osteoarthritis in some cases. <b><i>Level of Evidence IV, Case series.</i></b>
