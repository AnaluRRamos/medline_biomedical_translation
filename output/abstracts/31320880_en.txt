Celiac artery compression syndrome, also referred to as median arcuate ligament syndrome, celiac axis syndrome or Dunbar syndrome is a rare disorder consequent to extrinsic compression of the celiac trunk by the median arcuate ligament. Doppler ultrasound, multi-slice computed tomography angiography, magnetic resonance angiography, or invasive selective angiography can identify stenosis of the initial segment of the celiac artery and confirm diagnosis. Treatment options include open surgical or videolaparoscopic section of the median arcuate ligament and the fibers of the celiac plexus, or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty via an endovascular approach. We report herein an interesting case of a 38-year-old woman diagnosed with this rare condition and successfully treated with the surgical strategy.
