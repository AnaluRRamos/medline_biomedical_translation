To evaluate the reproducibility of a S2-alar iliac (S2AI) screw parameters measurement method by inter and intraobserver reliability. Cross-sectional study, considering computed tomography exams. Morphometric analysis was performed by multiplanar reconstructions. Screw length, diameter and trajectory angles were the studied variables. To analyze the measurements reproducibility, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used. Interobserver reliability was classified as strong for screw shortest length (ICC: 0.742) and diameter (ICC: 0.699). Interobserver reliability was classified as moderate for screw longest length (ICC: 0.553) and for screw trajectory angles in the axial plane for the longest (ICC: 0.478) and for the shortest lengths (ICC: 0.591). Intraobserver reliability was interpreted as excellent for screw shortest (ICC: 0.932) and longest lengths (ICC: 0.962) and diameter (ICC: 0.770) and screw trajectory angles in the axial plane for the screw longest (ICC: 0.773) and shortest lengths (ICC: 0.862). There were weak interobserver and strong intraobserver reliabilities for trajectory angle in sagittal plane, but no statistical significance was found. Inter and intraobserver reliability of S2AI screw morphometric parameters were interpreted from moderate to excellent in almost all studied variables, except for the screw trajectory angle in the sagittal plane measurement. <b><i>Level of Evidence IV, Diagnostic Studies - Investigating a Diagnostic Test.</i></b>
