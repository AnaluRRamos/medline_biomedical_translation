Microscopic colitis (MC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease with unclear etiology. Bile acid (BA) malabsorption has been described in MC patients. Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is the main BA receptor; FXR-mediated mechanisms prevent the noxious effects of BA accumulation, preserving the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier and preventing intestinal inflammation. Our aim was to describe the expression of FXR in patients with MC. Archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples from the terminal ileum, right and left colon were obtained from patients with MC and matched controls. Immunohistochemistry was performed and nuclear FXR expression scored in a semi-quantitative way. 169 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples from 35 patients with MC and 31 controls were retrieved. There was a significant reduction of FXR expression in patients with MC versus controls both in the right colon (moderate-strong FXR expression: 21.1 vs. 64.3%; <i>p</i> = 0.003) and left colon (moderate-strong FXR expression: 8.3 vs. 38.7%; <i>p</i> = 0.027). No significant differences in FXR expression were observed in the ileum of patients with MC (moderate-strong FXR expression: 76.9 vs. 90.9%; <i>p</i> = 0.5). We found no difference in FXR expression between the two types of MC. No association between the degree of lymphocyte infiltration or the thickness of collagen band and FXR expression was found. Patients with MC present a significantly lower expression of FXR in the colon. This could render colonic epithelial cells more susceptible to the deleterious effects of BA, contributing to disease pathogenesis and symptoms in MC.
