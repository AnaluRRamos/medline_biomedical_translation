To assess the quality of adult intensive care units. This population-based, cross-sectional, observational, analytical study evaluated management type in Maranhão, Brazil. An assessment instrument was applied that assigned scores to each service (maximum 124 points). The units were categorized as insufficient (< 50% of the maximum score), typical (≥ 50% and <80% of the maximum score), or sufficient (≥ 80% of the maximum score). Of the 26 intensive care units in Maranhão, 23 were evaluated; 15 (65.2%) were located in the state capital, and 14 (60.9%) were public. The mean final score was 67.2 (54.2% of the maximum). The worst performance was observed with regard to processes (50.9%) in the units located outside the capital (p = 0.037) and for hospitals with 68 beds or fewer (p = 0.027). The result of the assessment categorized services as a function of the overall total points earned. Specifically, 8 (34.8%) services were assessed as insufficient, 13 (56.5%) were assessed as typical, and 2 (8.7%) were assessed as sufficient. The majority of the intensive care units in this study were assessed as typical. These services must be better qualified. The priorities are the processes of the units located outside the capital and in small hospitals.
