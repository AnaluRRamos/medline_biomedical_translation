The scope of this article is to identify risk factors associated with unhealthy eating habits among truck drivers. It involved a cross-sectional study carried out with truck drivers individually interviewed at the Port of Paranaguá in the State of Paraná, Brazil. Information was obtained on the consumption of fruit, vegetables, fried salted food, sweetened beverages, and the removal of visible fat from red meat and of skin from chicken meat. Hierarchical Poisson regression models were applied to identify factors associated with unhealthy eating habits. Of those interviewed (n = 670), 53.1% had four or more unhealthy eating habits. This condition was associated with age less than 40 years (prevalence ratio, PR = 1.49; 95% confidence interval, CI = 1.28-1.73), moderate, low or very low ability to exercise the profession (PR 1.28; 95% CI 1.08-1.52), not taking physical exercise in free time (PR = 1.66; 95%CI = 1.38- 2.00), overall self-reported eating habits as poor or very poor (RP = 1.25; IC95% = 1.05-1.49) and body mass index < 25 Kg/m2 (PR = 1.22; 95% CI = 1.05-1.43). More than half of the truck drivers revealed unhealthy eating habits, highlighting the need for strategies to rectify these habits.
