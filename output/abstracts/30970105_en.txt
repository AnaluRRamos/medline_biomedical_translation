To assess the risk of falls in hospitalized elderly people. Cross-sectional study with a quantitative approach, carried out at University Hospital of the State of Paraíba. The sample consisted of 284 elderly subjects interviewed from April to October 2016. The Morse Fall Scale was used to evaluate the risk of falls. Elderly males (52.5%) aged between 60 and 69 years old (58.1%) and who were not literate (38.7%), prevailed. It was verified that 45% of the sample presented a high risk of falls. The secondary diagnosis and the use of intravenous therapy were the criteria that obtained a higher percentage of elderly at risk. Diuretics (p≤0.032), urinary incontinence (p≤0.001), visual deficit (p≤0.001) and heart failure (p≤0.001) were significantly associated with the high risk of falls. The use of specific tools in the prevention of falls allows the improvement in the quality of assistance based on scientific evidence, allowing effective intervention and potentiating patient safety.
