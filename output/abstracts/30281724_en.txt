The realization of the right to health of adolescents and young people deprived of their liberty in Brazil is a complex task that places us before health inequities and interventions on their social determinants of health. Therefore, this study sought to contribute to a discussion about the right to health of this population, based on the analysis of the implementation of the Comprehensive Healthcare Policy for Adolescent Offenders (PNAISARI). This is an analytical approach, using documentary analysis of legal frameworks and policy monitoring and evaluation data. In short, the results suggest that the policy strengthens the realization of the right to health of this population. However, its implementation must be promoted and qualified so that access to health care is, in fact, a reality in all states and municipalities.
