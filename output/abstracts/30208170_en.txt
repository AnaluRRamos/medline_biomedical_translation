The study aimed to: (1) describe the work process in Brazil's oral health teams, based on the essential attributes of primary health care, according to geographic region, type of team, and the municipality's socioeconomic characteristics and (2) verify whether the data in the work process of the oral health teams in the Brazilian National Program to Improve Access and Quality in primary health (PMAQ-AB) were capable of measuring such attributes. This was a nationwide ecological study with data from cycle I of PMAQ-AB. The study included descriptive, exploratory factor, and confirmatory factor analyses (Î± = 5%). Constructs were analyzed in light of the essential attributes of primary health care (first contact, coordination of care, comprehensiveness, and continuity). The first three constructs and a fourth factor were formed, called dental prosthesis actions. However, the continuity attribute was not formed. The models' goodness-of-fit measures were satisfactory. Factor loads were greater than 0.5, except for the two variables in factor 3. The actions most frequently performed by the oral health teams (> 60%) were in first contact, and the least frequent were those in comprehensiveness, highlighting referrals to specialties (7.6%). There were differences in the work process in oral health teams between regions of the country, type of team, and certification strata (p < 0.05). In conclusion, data on the work process in oral health teams from cycle primary health care in the services' work routine. Further research is recommended on continuity of care. In addition, the oral health teams participating in cycle I of PMAQ-AB should make further progress in actions related to comprehensiveness and coordination of care.
