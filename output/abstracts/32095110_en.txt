Epidural fibrosis is one of the main reasons for requiring repeated surgical intervention. Our objective was to compare the effect of Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) on the development of epidural fibrosis with collagen dural matrix and free autogenous fat graft. Male rats were separated into 3 groups. Laminectomy was implemented on the rats and epidural fat pad was placed in the first group (n = 7); equal size of collagen dural matrix was applied in the second group (n = 7); a single dose of PRP was applied in the third group (n = 7). Epidural fibrosis was more common in the group that collagen dural matrix was applied when compared the ones that PRP was applied. PRP group presented better values in preventing epidural fibrosis when compared to the fat pad group, however this difference was not statistically significant. PRP is a material that can be easily obtained from the very blood of patients and at an extremely low cost; the main clinical relevance of our study is that the PRP might be an efficient material for better clinical results after laminectomy surgery due to its tissue healing and epidural fibroris preventing potentials. <b><i>Level of Evidence V, Animal research</i>.</b>
