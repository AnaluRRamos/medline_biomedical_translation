There is a spectrum of possibilities for analyzing muscle O<sub>2</sub> resaturation parameters for measurement of reactive hyperemia in microvasculature. However, there is no consensus with respect to the responsiveness of these O<sub>2</sub> resaturation parameters for assessing reactive hyperemia. This study investigates the responsiveness of the most utilized muscle O<sub>2</sub> resaturation parameters to assess reactive hyperemia in the microvasculature of a clinical group known to exhibit impairments of tissue O<sub>2</sub> saturation (StO<sub>2</sub>). Twenty-three healthy young adults, twenty-nine healthy older adults, and thirty-five older adults at risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) were recruited. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to assess StO<sub>2</sub> after a 5-min arterial occlusion challenge and the following parameters were analyzed: StO<sub>2slope_10s</sub>, StO<sub>2slope_30s</sub>, and StO<sub>2slope_until_baseline</sub> (upslope of StO<sub>2</sub> over 10s and 30s and until StO<sub>2</sub> reaches the baseline value); time to StO<sub>2baseline</sub> and time to StO<sub>2max</sub> (time taken for StO<sub>2</sub> to reach baseline and peak values, respectively); âˆ†StO<sub>2reperfusion</sub> (the difference between minimum and maximum StO<sub>2</sub> values); total area under the curve (StO<sub>2AUCt</sub>); and AUC above the baseline value (StO<sub>2AUC_above_base</sub>). Only StO<sub>2slope_10s</sub> was significantly slower in older adults at risk for CVD compared to healthy young individuals (p < 0.001) and to healthy older adults (p < 0.001). Conversely, time to StO<sub>2max</sub> was significantly longer in healthy young individuals than in older adult at CVD risk. Our findings suggest that StO<sub>2slope_10s</sub> may be a measure of reactive hyperemia, which provides clinical insight into microvascular function assessment.
