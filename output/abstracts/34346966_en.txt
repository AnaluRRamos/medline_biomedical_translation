To construct nursing diagnosis statements of the International Classification for Nursing Practice (ICNP®) for the spinal cord rehabilitation specialty based on the Callista Roy Adaptation Model. Descriptive study developed in sequential steps of identification and cross-mapping of terms relevant to care with the health priority, construction and cross-mapping of nursing diagnosis statements based on the ICNP®, and categorization of diagnoses according to adaptive modes. Ninety-two statements of nursing diagnoses were developed, of which 66 were classified in the Physiological Mode, 12 in Functional Role Mode, 10 in Self-Concept Mode and four in Interdependence Mode. The nursing diagnoses developed portray focuses of attention for nursing care to people with spinal cord injury in rehabilitation and contribute to the direction of nursing care actions in a systematic, individualized and resolutive way.
