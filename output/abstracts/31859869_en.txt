This paper aims to analyze the profile and perceptions of the municipal health secretaries on the agendas and challenges for the SUS in the 2017-2020 cycle, with emphasis on the participation of nurses in management. The data were collected through an online electronic questionnaire, containing closed-ended questions, answered by municipal managers, within the National Survey of Municipal Health Secretaries, a national study carried out in 26 states in 2017 and 2018. We could understand to what extent nurse managers perceive the main challenges, the performance of strategic actors, the dynamics of interagency spaces, and federative agendas necessary to strengthen SUS management in the management process.
