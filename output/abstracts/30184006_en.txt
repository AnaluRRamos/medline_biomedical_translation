Investigate the efficacy of auditory training in students with auditory processing disorders and poor school performance using the software Programa de Escuta no Ru√≠do (PER), which addresses auditory processing skills, specifically listening in noise. Eighteen children aged 8-10 years, of both genders, participated in this study. All individuals participated in the following stages: pre-intervention assessment, intervention (consisting of placebo training, re-evaluation of auditory processing, and auditory training), and post-intervention assessment, so that the same individual is self-control. No statistically significant difference was observed between the pre-intervention assessment and the post-training auditory processing re-evaluation of the placebo, but statistically significant difference was found between the pre- and post-auditory training conditions. The present study achieved its general objective. The PER software proved to be effective for the auditory training of students with auditory processing disorders and poor school performance.
