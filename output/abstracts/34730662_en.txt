Since 2010, the organization of the Brazilian Unified Health System has as its main model the Health Care Networks, based on the Integrated Health Service Networks recommended by the Pan American Health Organization. This study aims to analyze the scientific production on Health Care Networks the integrative literature review method. The research was conducted in databases using the descriptors: Health Care Network and its counterparts in Portuguese and Spanish. A total of 27 articles were selected, including conceptual studies, case reports, implementation analyses and evaluation studies. The analysis of the publications evidenced five cores of meaning: the Health Care Network paradigm; Primary Care as network coordinator; regionalization, networks and regional governance; network care; and challenges for implementation. The results of this review point to two central questions: how to overcome the fragmentation of care, ensuring integrality, composing health care networks from distinct theoretical conceptions? And how can the production of care networks impact inter-federative relations, the financing process, the access to the system and the quality of health care processes?
