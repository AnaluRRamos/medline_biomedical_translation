The scope of this study was to identify individual and contextual factors associated with the self-perceived need for dental treatment and for prostheses among elderly Brazilians. An analysis was performed with data from the SB Brazil 2010 epidemiological survey conducted by the Ministry of Health with a sample of 7,619 elderly individuals. Multilevel logistic regression models of mixed random and fixed effects were used to the estimate odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) between the dependent variables and individual and contextual factors. Of the individuals assessed, 3,848 (50.5%) reported a need for dental treatment and 4,236 (55.6%) believed they have the need for prostheses. The results of multilevel logistic regression showed that gender, self-reported skin color, income and coverage by the oral health teams in the Family Health Program were associated with self-perception. This study revealed a greater influence of individual factors on the self-perceived need for dental treatment and prostheses by elderly Brazilians. This information can help to identify the inequalities that affect this population group and in setting priorities for the planning of health services.
