Describe the current status of the implementation of the Model of Comprehensive Care in Family and Community Health (MAIS, by its acronym in Spanish) in primary care in Chile. Cross-sectional study that evaluated the implementation of MAIS in a total of 1 263 primary care facilities. Through correlations, the relationship between internal self-evaluation and external evaluation of health services for each center was studied. The factors of facilities, communes and regions associated with the level of implementation of the MAIS were evaluated with multilevel analyses. The correlation between internal self-evaluation and the external evaluation of the total implementation of the MAIS was very high (0.819, p <0.001). The technology axis presented the highest implementation (83.0% compliance), and family focus the lowest (37.8% compliance). The facilities with the highest implementation were family health centers, the urban communes, those with the highest number of enrollees and those with the lowest poverty index. A statistically significant association was not identified between the implementation of the MAIS and the total community expenses (p = 0.122) nor specific health expenditures (p = 0.244). Most of the primary care health facilities have evaluated the level of implementation of the MAIS. The accompanying strategies for its implementation are priorities for primary care facilities located in rural areas and with a low number of registered users. Improving the family focus and the quality of care -key aspects of health care- are still a challenge.
