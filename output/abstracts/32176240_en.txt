Halitosis is highly prevalent in periodontitis and attributed mainly to the presence of volatile sulfur compounds (VSC), where hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is the chief culprit in the characteristic malodor of periodontitis and thus may play an active role in its pathogenesis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of H2S in the acute, intermediate and chronic immuneinflammatory host response and alveolar bone loss in vivo by using an animal model of induced periodontal disease. Thirtysix rats were divided into 2 groups: test group (n = 18), rats exposed to H2S (NaHS H2S donor molecule) and control group (n = 18), rats treated with saline only (Ctrl). All animals had one of their lower second molars ligated to induce periodontal disease (PD). The sound contralateral molar was used as control (H). Each group was subdivided into 3 (n = 6), according to followup time (3h, 5 days and 14 days). The gingival tissue was used for mRNA expression analysis (IL1, IL6, RANKL, OPG and SOFAT) by realtime PCR and the mandibles were analyzed morphometrically. Data analysis showed that the ligature promoted alveolar bone loss, observed mainly at 14 days, both in the group exposed to H2S and in the Ctrl group. H2S administration did not result in additional bone loss. Gene expression showed a significant increase in IL1, IL6, RANKL and SOFAT only in the CtrlPD group (p<0.05). A significant downregulation in OPG expression was observed over time in the CtrlPD group (p<0.05). In conclusion, H2S had no effect on alveolar bone loss in the absence of a ligature. In the presence of a ligature, however, exposure to H2S had an immunoregulatory effect on the expression of proinflammatory and proresorptive cytokines.
