Little is known regarding the use of emergency contraception among women from different regions of Brazil. The use of emergency contraception as well as contraceptive methods before and after coitus was analyzed. This cross-sectional study assessed the use of emergency contraception by interviewing 2,051 women aged between 18 and 49 attending 76 basic health units in three capitals: São Paulo-SP, Aracaju-SE and Cuiabá-MT. Aspects associated with the use of emergency contraception were analyzed by means of multiple logistic regression. Over half of the women reported the use of emergency contraception (56.7%). Having a high level of education, being from a more privileged socioeconomic group, having a paid job and having had four or more sexual partners were associated with the use of emergency contraception. Being 35 years of age or older and being in a stable relationship was negatively associated. The last time they used emergency contraception, 53.2% used another method, with the male condom and oral pill being the most frequent. Of those who did not use the method, half adopted the regular method after using it (51.7%). The conclusion drawn is that emergency contraception is widely used and does not appear to affect the use of the regular contraceptive method.
