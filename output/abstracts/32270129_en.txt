Reflecting on the role of the nursing staff in civil construction has paramount importance, because it enables improving knowledge and making discoveries. Such reflection is further useful for managers and workers to jointly develop disease prevention and health promotion strategies. The aim of the present study is to describe a nurse's contributions to a civil construction company. It consists of an experience report according to Callista Roy's adaptation theory. The analyzed experience took place from August 2017 through March 2018. We describe the activities carried out by the nurse jointly with other healthcare workers. We believe that the present study evidences the significance of occupational health nursing actions, particularly within civil construction, as well as the relevance of providing theoretical scientific grounds to such actions to contribute to make working environments healthier for all the involved actors without neglecting the aspect of productivity.
