Whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (WB-MRI) is a noninvasive imaging method that can be used to diagnose and stage tumors, as well as to assess therapeutic responses in oncology. The objective of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the accuracy of WB-MRI for the diagnosis of metastases in pediatric patients. The following electronic databases were searched: Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scientific Electronic Library Online, Latin-American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov. All of the selected studies included children and adolescents with histopathological confirmation of a primary tumor. Collectively, the studies included 118 patients ranging in age from 7 months to 19 years. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of WB-MRI were, respectively, 0.964 (95% CI: 0.944-0.978; <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0%) and 0.902 (95% CI: 0.882-0.919; <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 98.4%), with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.991. We found that WB-MRI had good accuracy for the diagnosis of metastases in pediatric patients and could therefore provide an alternative to complete the staging of tumors in such patients, being a safer option because it does not involve the use of ionizing radiation.
