To evaluate the results of patients undergoing arthroscopic surgical treatment for snapping scapula syndrome. This is a retrospective study of 11 patients undergoing scapulothoracic arthroscopy for the treatment of snapping scapula syndrome. The study included patients with clinical diagnosis of snapping scapula syndrome who did not show pain improvement after at least six months of physical therapy. Patients were assessed using the DASH, UCLA, visual analogue pain assessment (VAS), and Short-Form 36 (SF36) scores. The mean age at surgery was 38.4 years (21-48). The mean duration of symptoms before surgery was 2.8 years (range 6 months to 6 years). The mean follow-up duration was 12 months (range: 6.4-28). The mean postoperative scores were: DASH, 7.8 points; VAS, 1.5 points, being ten cases (90%) of mild pain and one case (10%) of moderate pain; UCLA, 32; and SF-36, 79.47. The arthroscopic approach for the treatment of snapping scapula syndrome presents excellent functional results.
