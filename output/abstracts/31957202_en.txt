Demodicosis is a common disease in small animal veterinary practice worldwide with a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic options. To provide consensus recommendations on the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of demodicosis in dogs and cats. The authors served as a Guideline Panel (GP) and reviewed the literature available before December 2018. The GP prepared a detailed literature review and made recommendations on selected topics. A draft of the document was presented at the North American Veterinary Dermatology Forum in Maui, HI, USA (May 2018) and at the European Veterinary Dermatology Congress in Dubrovnik, Croatia (September 2018) and was made available via the World Wide Web to the member organizations of the World Association for Veterinary Dermatology for a period of three months. Comments were solicited and responses were incorporated into the final document. In young dogs with generalized demodicosis, genetic and immunological factors seem to play a role in the pathogenesis and affected dogs should not be bred. In old dogs and cats, underlying immunosuppressive conditions contributing to demodicosis should be explored. Deep skin scrapings are the diagnostic gold standard for demodicosis, but trichograms and tape squeeze preparations may also be useful under certain circumstances. Amitraz, macrocyclic lactones and more recently isoxazolines have all demonstrated good efficacy in the treatment of canine demodicosis. Therapeutic selection should be guided by local drug legislation, drug availability and individual case parameters. Evidence for successful treatment of feline demodicosis is strongest for lime sulfur dips and amitraz baths.
