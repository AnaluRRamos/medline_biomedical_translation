This work analyzes the spatial distribution of leprosy in Bahia and associated social determinants. It is an ecological study, with leprosy data from 2001-2015. Three epidemiological indicators were selected: coefficient of detection in the general population and in children under 15 and the rate of new cases with grade II physical disability. These indicators were flattened by the Local Empirical Bayesian Model and Global and Local Moran statistics were applied. The independent variables were selected from the IBGE-2010 Census. Multivariate regressions were employed, followed by spatial regression. Leprosy exhibited a heterogeneous distribution in the state, with concentration in the north-west axis and the south region. For the general detection coefficient, five variables composed the final model: demographic density, urban population proportion, per capita income, proportion of extremely poor and households with over three people per dormitory. The illiteracy proportion made up the final model for the grade II rate of physical disability. No determinants of the occurrence of the disease were identified in children under 15. The modeling used contributed to demonstrate the spatial heterogeneity and social determinants of the disease in Bahia, revealing the complexity of the problem.
