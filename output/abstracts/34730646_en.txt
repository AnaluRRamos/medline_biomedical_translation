This paper aimed to assess the factors related to the physical capacity of upper and lower limbs in quilombola older adults. This is a cross-sectional, analytic study performed with elderly residents in the quilombola community Caiana dos Crioulos, Alagoa Grande, Para√≠ba, Brazil. The researched dependent variables were the physical capacity of upper and lower limbs. It was performed the Spearman correlation and multiple and linear simple regression (95% CI; p<0.05). This work was performed per Resolution 466/2012 from National Health Council. Forty-three older adults were assessed. The bivariate analyses showed a positive correlation between handgrip strength (HGS) and physical activity (PA), between HGS and arm muscle circumference (AMC), and an inverse correlation between Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) and age. The multiple-model for HGS was significantly correlated with age, AMC, and years of study (R2=0.374; p<0.05). Regarding the SPPB, it showed a significant correlation with age (R2=0.2524; p=0.001). Therefore, the muscle mass reserve, years of study, and age were factors related to the physical capacity among quilombola older adults. The strict compliance of these aspects and the early intervention can preserve physical capacity and ensure the productive inclusion and economic autonomy so much sought in the communities' social agenda.
