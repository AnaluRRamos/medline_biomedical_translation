To evaluate sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of preoperative joint aspiration (PJA) and periarticular tissue percutaneous biopsy (PTPB), as well as their combination, in the diagnosis of infection after total hip arthroplasty. This cross-sectional study (Level of Evidence II) was conducted with prospective data on 29 patients submitted to PJA with PTPB at the National Institute of Orthopedics and Traumatology from September 2015 to January 2016. Specimens obtained during the procedures underwent microbiological analyses, and the results were compared with those obtained in subsequent revision arthroplasty surgeries. PJA, PTPB, and their combination reached values of 78%, 73%, 89% for sensitivity, respectively; 72%, 90%, 94% for specificity; and 76%, 80%, 90% for accuracy. PJA combined with PTPB was sensitive, specific, and effective in diagnosing periprosthetic hip infection. <b><i>Level of Evidence II, Prospective Cross-Sectional Study</i></b>.
