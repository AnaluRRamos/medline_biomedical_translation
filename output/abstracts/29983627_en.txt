Globally, more than 1.2 million people die from traffic accidents each year. In order to reduce the rate of traffic accidents and their subsequent social consequences in Sao Paulo, Brazil, the aim of this study was to characterize pedestrian victims of traffic accidents and occurrences. This is a cross-sectional, quantitative, descriptive and retrospective epidemiological study of 2723 pedestrians injured in traffic accidents during 2016 in Sao Paulo. Of the total sample, 37.3% participants were female and 62.7% male; incidence was highest in the 10-19 year old age group (19.9%) and lower limb injuries were most frequent (28.6%). Of the cases attended in urgent health care units, 75.6% progressed to hospital discharge. Accidents were more frequent in the afternoon (44.6%), and most commonly involved cars (47.2%). This study showed the importance of making detailed records of traffic accidents to guide the government in intensive education efforts to develop a healthy society and respect for traffic regulations, to promote urban improvements involving signage and pavement, and to maintain pre-hospital and hospital care teams in strategic locations to minimize the time elapsed between the accident and care provided to the victim. Level of Evidence II; Retrospective study.
