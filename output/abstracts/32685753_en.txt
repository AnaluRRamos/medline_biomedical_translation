Metabolic syndrome and chronic diseases have impact on the job performance of police officers. To investigate the association of overweight/obesity and cardiovascular risk factors with work shift and duration of employment among police officers. Cross-sectional study with 102 police officers in Cajazeiras, Para√≠ba, Brazil, in which we analyzed sociodemographic data, occupational characteristics, body mass index (BMI), lipid profile, personal history of disease and lifestyle. Statistical analysis included the chi-square and Fisher's exact test. Overweight/obesity was found among most participants (83.3%). Hypertriglyceridemia (49.1%), low HDL-C (56.9%) and high LDL-C (46.1%) levels were associated with abnormal BMI (p<0.05). Hypertension was the main disease reported by overweight/obese participants (28.2%) (p=0.01). Job position, lifestyle and work shift were not associated with any of the analyzed variables, however, abnormal BMI, dyslipidemia, and hypertension were frequent among the participants with 6-10 or more than 10 years in the job (p<0.05). Part of the participants with at least 6 years in the job exhibited overweight/obesity in association with dyslipidemia and hypertension. We recommend prevention and therapeutic strategies to protect officers from chronic diseases or attenuate their long-term complications. Additional prospective studies are needed to confirm the associations we found, mainly between duration of employment and occupational diseases.
