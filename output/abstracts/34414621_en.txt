Lokivetmab is an effective treatment for atopic dermatitis (AD) in dogs. The aim of this prospective study was to determine if topical products containing plant extracts could enhance the clinical efficacy of lokivetmab. Thirty atopic dogs were included. Dogs were allocated randomly to be treated either with a single injection of lokivetmab (mean dose 1.34 mg/kg; Group A) or to a single injection (mean dose 1.28 mg/kg) coupled with a weekly topical treatment using a shampoo and a spot-on specifically designed to improve skin barrier defect (Group B). Clinical parameters evaluated included pruritus (pruritus Visual Analog Scale) and skin lesions (Canine Atopic Dermatitis Lesion Index, CADLI); cosmetic evaluation, and owner and investigator global assessment of efficacy (OGATE) also were carried out. Dogs were re-examined after 10, 17 and 31 days, and until a clinical relapse occurred. An improvement was noted for all dogs, with scores being significantly better in dogs in Group B than in those in Group A; after 10 days for cosmetic evaluation, 17 days for pruritus (P = 0.039) and OGATE, and 31 days for CADLI (P = 0.043). A longer-lasting remission was noted in Group B compared to Group A; dogs receiving the combined treatment showed an extended time to flare compared to dogs treated with lokivetmab alone (P = 0.012). This study suggests that combining lokivetmab with topical therapies designed to repair the skin barrier potentially have value in the treatment of AD in dogs.
