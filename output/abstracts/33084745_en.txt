In recent years the increasing number of interventional procedures has resulted in growing concerns regarding radiation exposure for patients and staff. The evaluation of radiation exposure in children is difficult due to the great variability in body weight. Therefore, reference levels of radiation are not well defined for this population. To study and validate the ratio of dose-area product (DAP) to patient weight as a reference measurement of radiation for hemodynamic congenital heart disease procedures in children. This observational multicenter study uses data obtained from a Brazilian registry of cardiac catheterization for congenital heart disease from March 2013 to June 2014. Inclusion criteria were all patients aged <18 years old undergoing hemodynamic procedures for congenital heart disease, with recorded DAP doses. P-value < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. This study evaluated 429 patients with median age and weight of 50 (10, 103) months and 15 (7, 28) kg, respectively. Median DAP was 742.2 (288.8, 1,791.5) Î¼Gy.m2. There was a good correlation between DAP and weight-fluoroscopic time product(rs=0.66). No statistically significant difference was observed in DAP/weight ratio between therapeutic and diagnostic procedures. There was a wide variation in the DAP/weight ratio among the therapeutic procedures (p<0.001). The DAP/weight ratio is the simplest and most applicable measurement to evaluate radiation exposure in a pediatric population. Although there is limited literature available, the doses obtained in the present study were similar to those previously found. Ongoing research is important to evaluate the impact of strategies to reduce radiation exposure in this population (Arq Bras Cardiol. 2020; [online].ahead print, PP.0-0)
