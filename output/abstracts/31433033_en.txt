The study aimed to describe clinical and sociodemographic characteristics, estimate incidence, and analyze factors associated with dropout and death during treatment of TB cases reported in indigenous children and adolescents in Brazil from 2006 to 2016. A historical case series was performed on incidence according to age bracket and major geographic region, and multinomial logistic regression was used to explain factors associated with treatment dropout and death. Of the 2,096 reported cases, 88.2% evolved to cure, 7.2% dropped out of treatment, and 4.6% evolved to death. There was a predominance of cases in boys 15-19 years of age and a higher proportion of deaths (55.7%) in children < 4 years. Considering indigenous children and adolescents with TB in Brazil as a whole, mean incidence was 49.1/100,000, ranging from 21.5/100,000 to 97.6/100,000 in the Northeast and Central, respectively. Cases with insufficient and irregular follow-up showed higher odds of dropout (OR = 11.1; 95%CI: 5.2-24.8/OR = 4.4; 95%CI: 1.9-10.3) and death (OR = 20.3; 95%CI: 4.9-84.9/OR = 5.1; 95%CI: 1.2-22.7). Cases in retreatment (OR = 2.4; 95%CI: 2.08-8.55) and with HIV coinfection (OR = 8.2; 95%CI: 2.2-30.9) were also associated with dropout. Extrapulmonary (OR = 1.8; 95%CI: 1.1-3.3) and mixed clinical forms (OR = 5.6; 95%CI: 2.8-11.4), age < 4 years (OR = 3.1; 95%CI: 1.5-6.4), and cases from the North (OR = 2.8; 95%CI: 1.1-7.1) and Central (OR = 2.8; 95%CI: 1.1-7.0) were associated with death. TB control in indigenous children and adolescents cannot be achieved without investments in research and development and without reducing social inequalities.
