to analyze the in-hospital complications of prolonged hospital stay in patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, admitted to the stroke unit of a tertiary hospital. this is an evaluative correlational study. All first-ever ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack patients admitted were retrospectively analyzed. During hospital stay, the predictors of long-term hospitalization considered were: 1) clinical complications (pneumonia, urinary tract infection, pressure damage and deep vein thrombosis), and 2) neurological complications (malignant ischemic stroke and symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation). 353 patients were discharged in the study period. Mean age was 64.1±13.7 years old and 186 (52.6%) were men. The mean time of hospital stay was 13.7±14.3 days. Pneumonia (25.3±28.8 days, p<0.001), urinary tract infection (32.9±45.2 days, p<0.001) and malignant stroke (29.1±21.4 days, p<0.001) increased significantly the length of hospital stay compared to patients without any complications (11.2±7.1 days). this study showed that three complications delayed hospital discharge in patients admitted in a stroke unit, two preventable ones: pneumonia and urinary tract infection. More intense measures to avoid them should be included in the performance indicators to reduce the length of hospital stay in stroke units.
