simvastatin has pleiotropic anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects potentially usefull to prevent chemotherapy-induced gastrointestinal mucositis. Studies on this are scarce. This study aimed to examine the effects of simvastatin on gastric and intestinal mucositis after 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment in rats. rats weighing 270±18g were divided into two groups. The 5-FU+saline group (5-FU/SAL) rats were treated with 5-FU (50mg/kg) plus 0.9% saline orally (gavage) once daily for five days. The 5-FU+simvastatin (5-FU/SIMV) group was treated with 5-FU (50mg/kg), plus simvastatin (10mg/kg), in the same way. The rats were euthanased on the sixth day, then their stomach and intestine were photographed and removed for exams. Dosages of serum TNF-a, IL-1ß, IL-6 and histopathology were done for stomach and intestine. body-weight was significantly lower in rats treated with 5-FU+saline than the weight loss of the 5-FU/SIMV group rats. TNF-a expression was lower in 5-FU/SIMV group (172.6±18pg/ml) than in 5-FU/SAL (347.5±63pg/ml). Serum IL-1b was lower in 5-FU/SAL group (134.5±23pg/ml) than in 5-FU/SIMV (48.3±9pg/ml). Serum IL-6 was 61.8±15pg/ml in 5-FU/SIMV and 129.4±17pg/ml in 5-FU/SAL groups. These differences were significant (p<0.05). Mucosal damage in stomach and jejunum were observed in rats receiving 5-FU alone. In the stomach and jejunum, simvastatin caused significant protective effects against 5-FU-induced mucosal injury. simvastatin attenuated gastric and intestinal mucositis related to 5-FU therapeutics in animal model. These data encourage forthcoming clinical studies addressing the usefulness of statins in the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal mucositis.
