Around 10-15% of patients diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) have a positive family history for FTD with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Since the identification of mutations in <i>MAPT</i> (microtubule-associated protein tau gene) in 1998, over 10 other genes have been associated with FTD spectrum disorders, discussed in this review. Along with <i>MAPT</i>, mutations in <i>GRN</i> (progranulin) and <i>C9orf72</i> (chromosome 9 open reading frame 72) are the most commonly identified in FTD cohorts. The association of FTD and motor neuron disease (MND) can be caused by mutations in <i>C9orf72</i> and other genes, such as <i>TARDBP</i> (TAR DNA-binding protein), <i>FUS</i> (fused in sarcoma), <i>UBQLN2</i> (ubiquilin 2). Multisystem proteinopathy is a complex phenotype that includes FTD, Paget disease of the bone, inclusion body myopathy and MND, and can be due to mutations in <i>VCP</i> (valosing containing protein) and other recently identified genes.
