To identify the preoperative prognostic factors influencing pancreatic cancer survival following curative resection in a single Brazilian institution. From 2005 to 2018, preoperative clinic, demographic and laboratory data were prospectively collected. Survival analysis was performed by the Kaplan-Meier method and the comparison between curves by the log-rank test. For multivariate analysis, the Cox regression model was used. advanced age (p = 0.012) and previous history of cancer (p = 0.026) were the preoperative factors, according to the univariate analysis, that significantly impacted survival. Patients with preoperative serum levels of CA 19.9 from 38 to 554 U/mL had a 3.15 times higher chances of death (HR 3.15; 95% CI 1.01-9.82; p = 0.047), whereas patients with the marker above 554 U/mL were 3.96 times more likely than those with the normal level (HR 3.96; 95% CI 1.19-13.10; p = 0.024), by using the multivariate analysis. Patients with previous comorbidities had a 2.90 times higher chance of death than those without associated conditions (HR 2.90; 95% CI 1.10-7.67; p = 0.032). Preoperative factors related to the worst prognosis after pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma resection were advanced age, presence of comorbidities, previous history of cancer and elevated preoperative serum CA 19.9.
