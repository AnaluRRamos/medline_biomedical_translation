Topical corticosteroids are commonly used in the management of allergic otitis externa to diminish inflammation. A common strategy is to make compounded solutions of dexamethasone in ear cleaner. The objective of this study was to determine the stability of dexamethasone when added to four commercial ear cleaners (ec): designated ecA, ecB, ecC and ecD. Two concentrations (0.1 and 0.25 mg/mL) of dexamethasone were formulated for each cleaner solution from a 2 mg/mL solution and stored in the original manufacturers' bottles at two temperatures: room (22 ˚C) and refrigerated (4 ˚C). Samples were evaluated in triplicate, using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry at 10 time points over 90 days. The mean and standard deviation were calculated for each time point. A solution was considered stable if the dexamethasone value remained >90% of the target concentration. All dexamethasone solution values were stable to 90 days, except two solutions for ecA; the 0.25 mg/mL dexamethasone concentration was only stable to 14 (4 ˚C) and 21 days (22 ˚C). These results provide preliminary evidence in support of pharmaceutical stability data for dexamethasone when included in the above compounded solutions at the noted concentrations and temperatures.
