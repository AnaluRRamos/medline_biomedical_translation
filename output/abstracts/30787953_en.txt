Cerebral ischemia is a very rare and harmful complication of ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy for treatment of varicose veins. This case describes a documented cerebrovascular ischemia in Broca's area following ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy. Less than one hour after intravenous injection of 10 ml of sclerosing foam, an otherwise healthy woman experienced aphasia without any other signs of neurological changes. When she arrived home, a complete inability to talk was observed. The event was misdiagnosed by another doctor as an allergic reaction. Next morning she came to the office to report the allergic reaction, where an appropriate diagnosis was made. She recovered just two days after the injection, but signs of recent cerebral ischemia were seen in Broca's area on magnetic resonance and transesophageal bubble study echocardiogram revealed a patent foramen ovale. Although rare, we must make great effort to prevent these events instead of treating them.
