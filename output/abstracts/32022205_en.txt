This paper aims to present the use of triangulation in qualitative research as a strategy to achieve the proposed objectives, to ensure credibility, reliability, and greater scientific accuracy in its achievement. In this sense, triangulation - since it is not restricted to the use of only one method, theory, data source or researcher in the process of analyzing an event - allows the apprehension of a given reality from several angles, enabling information confrontation, in order to minimize bias resulting from a single analytical perspective. Thus, aiming at evidencing the possibilities of using such a methodological design, we used as an example a qualitative study about experiences of caregivers for patients with head and neck neoplasms, developed through multiple triangulation, namely: methodological (intra-method), data, researcher and environmental triangulation. When demonstrating a structured study in the form of triangulation, one aims to guide researchers interested in conducting qualitative studies with greater depth and methodological rigor in qualitative research.
