The study aimed to analyze the profile of service providers in the Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS) in relation to high-risk neonatal care procedures, based on data from the public-access database on Authorizations for Hospital Admissions (AIH) without identification of the neonatal patient. This cross-sectional study used data on AIH of unidentified newborns up to one day old, issued from January 2013 to December 2015, and from the National Registry of Healthcare Establishments. The TwoStep Cluster method was used to classify the establishments with similar characteristics. Regional differences were observed in the frequency of use of neonatal intensive care units and in special procedures recorded in the databases. The TwoStep Cluster method identified three groupings of providers: the first with 1,151 establishments and with low-complexity hospitalizations, the second with 84 establishments and surgical-profile hospitalizations, and the third with 393 establishments and higher complexity hospitalizations in neonatal care, including surgeries. The records on admissions jointly with multivariate analytical techniques have the potential to support decision-making by SUS administrators in the organization of neonatal care.
