To compare infant mortality rates of indigenous and non-indigenous children according to microregions in Brazil. The study was based on data from the 2010 Population Census and from the Mortality Information System. Rates and proportions were calculated using data from 558 microregions. Indigenous children presented a higher risk of dying before completing one year of age (60% higher compared to non-indigenous), and rates were higher in microregions with < 1%Â  of indigenous population. Seven out of 10 deaths were in children over one month of age and were mostly caused by infectious diseases. In general, indigenous children die mostly due to preventable causes. The study shows that there are important differences in the levels of infant mortality between indigenous and non-indigenous children in Brazil, even in geographical areas with increased presence of indigenous population.
