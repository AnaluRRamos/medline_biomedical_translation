This study investigated the self-perception of 49 women, monolingual speakers of Brazilian Portuguese, about their tongue position for the alveolar articulation of the fricatives [s] and [z]. The video recording of speech samples of these 49 women (ages 18 to 28) were analyzed by three Speech-Language Pathologists. They were classified into two groups: Group 1 (G1, n=25), with no alterations in the tongue position during the production of [s] and [z], and Group 2 (G2, n=24), with alterations in the tongue position during the production of [s] and [z]. The tongue position self-perception experiment required the participants to identify the specific tongue constriction point in the production of [s] and [z] (apical, laminal, or 'other') during the reading of 24 words and 24 pseudowords. The Friedman test, with posterior paired comparisons, was used for the intragroup analysis. The Mann-Whitney test was used for intergroup comparisons. The statistical significance adopted was 5% (p<0.05). G1 reported apical and laminal tongue constrictions while GE reported these constrictions plus other tongue adjustments. The presence of other tongue adjustments differentiated the groups, G1 and G2 (p=0,002). There were significant differences between [s] and [z] for G1, with the laminal position occurring more often in [s] compared to [z]. Women with and without alteration in the tongue position reported apical and laminal constrictions. Howerer, other tongue adjustments were self-perceived in the presence of altered tongue position.
