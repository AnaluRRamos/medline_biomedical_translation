This study aimed to identify and analyze the relations between aging and work. This was a case study in the maintenance engineering division of a high-complexity hospital in the city of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. In September and October 2015, 16 semi-structured interviews were held with the division heads and other workers with a minimum age of 50 years. The data were analyzed with thematic content analysis. Although the workers experienced difficulties resulting from the aging process, these did not prevent them from performing their work activities, since they developed strategies through their knowhow to compensate for their functional losses and/or declines. Still, they felt limited and demotivated due to the poor working conditions, outsourcing of the division, and the prevailing workload organization. Thus, in this division, the working conditions and organization had more impact than the aging process on the individuals' daily work routine.
