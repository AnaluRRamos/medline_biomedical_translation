This study aims to evaluate the role of an advanced endoscopist to study the entire colon after an incomplete colonoscopy. All patients with an elective incomplete colonoscopy performed under deep sedation in our department between January 2010 and October 2016 were included. Patients with a colonic stenosis, an inadequate bowel preparation, or a colonoscopy performed without deep sedation were excluded. Included patients were followed up to evaluate if and what type of subsequent examinations (colonoscopy by an advanced endoscopist, single-balloon enteroscopy [SBE], and/or CT colonography) was performed to complete the study of the entire colon. Lesions found during these subsequent examinations were also recorded. Ninety-three patients had an incomplete colonoscopy, with no diagnosis of colorectal cancer (CRC) and a high-risk polyp rate of 5.4% (<i>n</i> = 5). Seventy-seven patients with incomplete colonoscopies underwent subsequent examinations, namely CT colonography in 45.5% (<i>n</i> = 35), colonoscopy by an advanced endoscopist in 53.2% (<i>n</i> = 41), and SBE in 13% (<i>n</i> = 10). In the 49 patients who performed either colonoscopy (<i>n</i> = 39) or SBE (<i>n</i> = 10) by an advanced endoscopist, the cecal intubation rate was 100%, and high-risk polyps were found in 26.5% (<i>n</i> = 13) and CRC in 4.1%. CT colonography revealed findings consistent with polyps and CRC in 22.9% (<i>n</i> = 8) and 2.9% (<i>n</i> = 1) of the cases, respectively. Colonoscopy was further repeated in 6 patients with suspected polyps in CT colonography, confirming the initial diagnosis in 5 patients. Colonoscopy by an advanced endoscopist achieved cecal intubation in all patients, representing a good choice after an incomplete colonoscopy.
