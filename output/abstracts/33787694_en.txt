An analysis is presented of actions taken by the Brazilian research institution Fiocruz for the communication and popularization of science, from two perspectives. The aim was to investigate how a system for the communication and popularization of science is organized at a large scientific institution and how it is articulated with the institutional discourse. A brief review is presented of how the topic has developed over the history of Fiocruz, followed by a discussion of the way it has been addressed in its official planning documents. The science communication/popularization actions undertaken in 2015 and 2016 were mapped out and classified according to how they interact with the public, giving a better understanding of this area.
