To evaluate the epidemiological characteristics and tendency of new leprosy cases in people younger than 15 years in the state of Bahia, Brazil, between 2007 and 2017. Quantitative, cross-sectional, descriptive study of cases registered in the Notifiable Diseases Information System. The sociodemographic variables were statistically analyzed through the G-test and trend classification was analyzed through linear regression, along with the tendency or percentage change. The study comprised 2,298 new cases and presented decreasing rate of detection, growing proportion of investigated contacts, and decreasing proportion of healing. Paucibacillary cases are emphasized, with a 63.27% proportion and predominance among females with incomplete primary education and brown race/color living in urban zones. Regarding clinical forms, physical disabilities, and modes of detection, 26.68% were tuberculoid, 73.72% were grade zero, and 36.42% were referral, respectively. The increased tendency in the proportion of investigated contacts and the decrease in the proportion of healing revealed a need for the health system to improve patient follow-up during treatment against leprosy.
