Pancreatic/gastrointestinal tract neuroendocrine neoplasm (NEN) is divided into neuroendocrine tumor (NET) and neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) according to the grade of malignancy, and differences are seen in clinical prognosis. NET, and rectal NET in particular, is often treated endoscopically. Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) was previously the main intervention for rectal NET, but EMR with a ligation device (EMR-L) and endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) are now also used. However, complete resection with these therapies is not always achieved. The pocket creation method (PCM) is a safe ESD method for colon tumors that offers a high en bloc resection rate compared with conventional colonic ESD. We performed ESD using the PCM for rectal NET and evaluated the complete resection rate. We performed ESD using the PCM in 4 patients. This procedure was technically feasible in all patients. Endoscopically, all cases were resected en bloc, and pathological complete resection was achieved in all cases. No complications such as perforation or delayed postoperative bleeding were encountered. PCM should be considered when treating NET of appropriate size.
