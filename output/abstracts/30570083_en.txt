To analyze workers' cases of work leave caused by mental and behavioral disorders. A cross-sectional census study conducted between June and July 2017 in which data were used from the National Social Security Institute database, with all workers' records. Data were analyzed by using descriptive statistics and inferential tests. The sample included 2,449 workers. Workers who were on leave because of mental and behavioral disorders were mostly women, aged between 31 and 40 years and with an income of less than or equal to one or two minimum wages. The first and second reasons for work leave were mood disorders. Working in an urban setting was considered a risk factor for more than one work leave (p<0.05). The following disorders were strongly associated with more than one work leave (p<0.001): mood disorder; schizophrenia; schizotypal and delusional disorders; disorders related to the use of psychoactive substances; stress-related disorders; and somatoform disorders. Employers are encouraged to invest in the mental health of their workers with a view to promoting health and avoiding work leave.
