The assessment of the degree to which health professionals, workers and organizations are ready to implement changes in health services deserves special attention, especially related to new technologies, public policies and innovation. The objectives of this study were to conduct a Brazilian Portuguese Brazil cross-cultural adaptation of the ORIC questionnaire and to initiate the study of its psychometric properties. Through a cross-sectional study, the Organizational Readiness for Implementing Change (ORIC) questionnaire, containing 12 questions, was translated and later applied to a sample of workers from traditional primary health care units undergoing transformation to family health units. Statistical analysis included Cronbach's alpha, exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis by structural equation model using the Consensus-Based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) checklist. Workers from ten health units participated in the study (n = 150). The analysis confirmed two main factors (Effectiveness and Commitment) with Eigenvalues > 1. Rotation by the orthogonal method showed that the instrument questions confirmed the factors analyzed by the original instrument. The total Cronbach's Alpha of ORIC was 0.94, showing excellent reliability. The Brazilian Portuguese Brazil version of the ORIC-Br questionnaire showed good psychometric properties and can be used in health services to measure organizational readiness, considered as an indicator of the potential success in implementing change.
