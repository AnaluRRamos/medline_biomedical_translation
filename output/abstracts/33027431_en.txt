Adherence to a healthy diet depends on factors such as food prices, while studies in developed countries have identified higher costs of more nutritional foods. The current study aimed to assess the direct food expenditures by adults with cardiovascular disease in Brazil, investigating the relationship between cost and quality of diet. The study used data from a randomized clinical trial, the BALANCE Program. The current study is a cross-sectional baseline analysis of participants with high adherence to the trial, conducted in 35 sites in all five major geographic regions of Brazil. Food consumption by 1,160 individuals was collected with a 24-hour dietary recall (24HR), quality of diet was measured with the Diet Quality Index Revised (DQI-R), and direct food costs were estimated from market prices. No significant differences were observed between tertiles of adherence in the direct costs of food or individual characteristics. When all the 24HR were analyzed, there was no correlation between cost and quality of diet (r = 0.38; p = 0.17), while analysis by tertiles showed a weak correlation in the lowest tertile of adherence (r = -0.112; p = 0.03). The study showed absence of differences between direct costs of healthy versus unhealthy foods, a finding that can serve as an incentive for adherence to food recommendations in Brazil, thereby minimizing barriers to the adoption of healthy lifestyles.
