Osteochondral fracture after acute patellar dislocation in teenagers is relatively common (up to 60% of cases of patellar dislocation), but poorly diagnosed. There are several treatments proposed for this type of injury, but none well defined in the literature. A male patient, 13 years old, with a diagnosis of osteochondral fracture of the lateral femoral condyle after acute dislocation of the right patella. He underwent surgical treatment of the chondral injury, which consisted of suturing of the chondral fragment to the cartilage defect and, in a second approach, reconstruction of the medial patellotibial ligament and medial patellofemoral ligament with autologous flexor graft. Currently, the patient has been followed up for 16 months postoperatively for the suture of the chondral fragment and for 8 months for the ligament reconstruction. He has been evaluated through functional scores and T2 weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Acute fixation through direct bone suturing of a purely chondral fragment can be considered in special situations.
