Ideal Nail Length (INL) provides better outcomes after Intramedullary Nailing (IMN) of Tibia Shaft Fractures (TSF). Intraoperative methods do not allow for preoperative planning. Changing the nail may cause complications. X-rays are commonly used, but displacement or magnification errors may occur. Forearm measurements may be benefical in bilateral TSF. We aim to examine correlations of anthropometric measurements (AMs) and INL and use them to obtain formulae. Tuberositas Tibia-Medial Malleolus (TM), Tuberositas Tibia-Ankle joint (TA), knee-ankle joint (JJ), and olecranon tip-5th Metacarpal head (OM) distances were evaluated in 76 IMN patients. Correlation analyses were performed and the results used to create formulae. The correlations between INL and TM-left, TM-right, TA-left, TA-right, OM-left, OM-right, JJ-left, JJ-right were 0.81, 0.83, 0.77, 0.77, 0.82, 0.80, 0.90, 0.91 respectively for males; and 0.93, 0.89, 0.88, 0.86, 0.80, 0.82, 0.90, 0.89 respectively for females. AMs show excellent correlation in both sexes (p<0.0001). Regression analysis was statistically significant in all formulae. The most compatible correlations in males were JJ-right and JJ-left; and in females, TM-left, TM-right, and JJ-right. The most compatible correlations wth INL were JJ in males, and TM and JJ in females. OM can be used in the presence of bilateral TSF, edema, wounds and obesity. AMs are useful preoperatively. The formulae can be used to ensure INL and reduce errors, time and radiation.
