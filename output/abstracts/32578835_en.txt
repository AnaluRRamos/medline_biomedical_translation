To analyze the quality indicators of the hearing screening program and to evaluate lingual frenulum in newborns, in terms of coverage rates, duration of hearing screening, referral indexes and prevalence of ankyloglossia in a university hospital specializing in mother and child care. This is a cross-sectional study, in which we analyzed the database of the newborn hearing screening and lingual frenulum assessment program for the period between September 2015 and August 2016. During the study period, 2,345 babies were born at the institution, 1,380 (58.8%) underwent newborn hearing screening and 1,350 (57.6%) were diagnosed with a lingual frenulum. Mean gestational age was 39 weeks (± 1.6), birth weight 3478g (± 469.2) and 69% were boys. In newborn hearing screening, 95.7% of the 1,380 babies screened were discharged with guidance, 2.4% were referred for auditory monitoring and 1.9% of babies were referred for auditory diagnosis. In lingual frenulum assessment, 123 (9.1%) of the 1,350 evaluated, had ankyloglossia, 85 were boys and 47 girls. The indicators of the time of life in which the hearing screening is performed, the referral indices and ankyloglossia prevalence are in line with those reported in the literature; however, coverage rates were lower than recommended and do not comply with Brazilian law.
