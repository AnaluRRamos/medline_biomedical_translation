To estimate the prevalence of access and use of speech-language therapy services and identify the variables associated with access. Cross-sectional population-based study. The sample consisted of adult individuals living in Porto Alegre, southern Brazil. The data were collected using an instrument constructed with domains of national research questionnaires, with a module on speech-language therapy. The outcome was the access to a speech-language therapist. Poisson regression with robust variance was used to calculate Prevalence Ratios with 95% confidence intervals. A total of 214 people participated in the study, of which 67.3% (n = 144) were female. The mean age was 54.28 (SDÂ±18.83) years. Fifty-six (26.2%) people mentioned the need for speech-language therapy consultation. All 56 subjects were able to perform speech-language therapy, of which 69.4% (n = 39) in private practice and 19.6% (n=11) used healthcare insurance plans at partnering providers. In the final model, the highest prevalence of access was associated with female (PR=1.09,95%CI1.01-1.18) and had some deficiency (PR = 1.09,95%CI1.03-1.17). Access to a speech-language therapist is more frequent in private services. It is observed that women and the disabled individuals have a higher prevalence of access to speech-language therapist.
