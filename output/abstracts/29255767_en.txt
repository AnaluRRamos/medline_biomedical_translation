In recent years, endoscopic image documentation has gained an important role in gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopic reporting and has become an integral aspect of quality control. Since 2001, several important guidelines and statements, some from major endoscopic societies, have been published to standardize endoscopic image documentation. Therefore, and according to the most recent recommendations of the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, we propose a set of images to be routinely captured in upper and lower GI endoscopy. Systematic acquisition of 10 and 9 photographs of specific landmarks is recommended in upper-GI endoscopy and colonoscopy, respectively. In addition to photo documentation of the normal endoscopic features, imaging of pathologic findings is also advocated. Considering accurate and adequate image documentation as an essential part of endoscopic reporting, it should be systematically performed in upper and lower GI endoscopy.
