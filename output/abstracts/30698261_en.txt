Comparison between federal Brazilian legal frameworks in the areas of health and sanitation, from the perspective of participation, is the thread of this work, considering the pioneering of health and its possible influence on sanitation. The comparative effort was made from six analytical criteria: defined social control mechanisms; character given to social control; responsibility, recommendations and support to enable social control; access to information; control over the use of resources; control of the implementation of the resolutions. It was evaluated if the sanitation framework have been helped by health formulations and if have achieved produce more effective practices of social control in the conduct of public policy. The results show that, although it has received some influence from the health area, the water and sanitation framework is more restricted and has less potential to produce more effective practices, since it presents: 1) more restrictive mechanisms because they are not necessarily deliberative; 2) lack of a policy of training counselors and popular education to incentive participation; 3) absence of effective mechanisms for monitoring the use of resources.
