To analyze the effects of neuromuscular electrical stimulation of the femoral quadriceps associated or not with whey protein supplementation on the electromyographic activity and body mass distribution in volunteers undergoing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. 24 volunteers were randomly divided into three groups: basal control, whey protein in association with neuromuscular electrical stimulation, and neuromuscular electrical stimulation alone. In the postoperative evaluation, during the mini squat, the basal group showed a decrease in the electromyographic activity of the vastus medialis (p = 0.005, eyes open; p = 0.003, eyes closed), vastus lateralis (p = 0.005, eyes open; p = 0.020; eyes closed) and rectus femoris (p = 0.075, eyes open; p = 0.074, eyes closed) and of body mass distribution in the injured limb (p < 0.001, eyes open; p < 0.001, eyes closed), and in the healthy limb (p < 0.001, eyes open; p < 0.001, eyes closed). The early use of neuromuscular electrical stimulation of the quadriceps femoris maintained the electromyographic activity of the vastus medialis and vastus lateralis muscles and prevented asymmetries in body mass distribution 15 days after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. <b><i>Level of Evidence I, High quality randomized trial.</i></b>
