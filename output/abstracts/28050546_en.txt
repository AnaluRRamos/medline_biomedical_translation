Intertrochanteric femur fractures are very common in patients over 65 years old, and are often associated with osteoporosis. Proximal femoral nails are preferred because of their biomechanical advantages in the treatment of these fractures, especially if the fracture is unstable. However, many complications associated with intramedullary fracture fixation have been described. The medial migration of the intramedullary gamma nail is a rare complication. The authors report an uncommon but potentially fatal complication, medial and intrapelvic migration of the intramedullary Gamma 3 nails, recorded after one month of osteosynthesis. This article aims to alert the orthopedic community to this rare complication, which may present a high risk of morbidity and mortality.
