The aim of this study was to evaluate the functional outcome of surgically treated acetabular fractures. A prospective longitudinal study was undertaken in this hospital during the period from December 2010 to December 2014. A total number of 46 patients with the diagnosis of acetabular fracture were included in the study. The main cause of the acetabular injury was a road traffic accident. All the patients were treated surgically with plates and screws. Outcome was assessed radiologically and functionally, employing the Harris Hip Score. The mean follow-up period of the patients in the postoperative period was 30 months (24-36 months). The results were excellent in 60.86%, good in 21.73%, fair in 8.69%, and poor in 8.69%. Post-operative complications of acetabular fracture such as heterotopic ossification were found in 2.17%, osteoarthritis in 6.52%, skin infections in 4.34%, nerve lesions in 2.17%, and vascular necrosis in 4.34% of patients. More than 80% of patients were satisfied with the results of acetabular surgeries. These results show that internal fixation of acetabular fractures leads to a good outcome in the majority of patients.
