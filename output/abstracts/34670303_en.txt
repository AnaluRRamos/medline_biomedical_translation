The aim of the present study was to compare the local and systemic expression of the factors linked to the interferon alpha (IFN-α) activation pathway in different degrees of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical cancer.  A total of 128 patients with CIN I, CIN II, CIN III and cervical cancer was evaluated. The real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique was used to evaluate the gene expression of <i>IFNR1</i>, <i>IFNR2</i>, IFN-α, oligoadenylate synthase (2'5'OAS), cytokine signal suppressor 1 (<i>SOCS</i>) 1, <i>SOCS3</i>, signal transducer and transcription activator 1 (<i>STAT1</i>), and <i>IRF9</i> from 128 biopsies. A total of 46 out of 128 samples were evaluated by flow cytometry for <i>IFNAR1</i>, <i>IFNAR2</i>, <i>STAT1</i>, <i>IRF7</i> and IFN-α in peripheral blood cells.  Patients with CIN II and III (63 samples) had a low local expression of <i>IFNR1</i>, but not <i>IFNR2</i>. Patients with some degree of injury showed high expression of <i>SOCS1</i> and <i>SOCS3</i>. Systemically, patients with CIN II and III (20 samples) had a significant increase in <i>IFNR1</i>, <i>IFNR2</i>, <i>STAT1</i>, <i>IRF7</i>, and IFN-α in helper, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and in monocytes.  Patients with high-grade lesions have increased systemic expression of IFN-α and its activation pathways in helper and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, as well as in monocytes due to an exacerbation of the immune response in these patients. This phenomenon is not accompanied by resolution of the lesion due to a defect in the IFN-α activation pathway that revealed by low local IFNAR1 expression and high local expression of <i>SOCS1</i> and <i>SOCS3</i>.
