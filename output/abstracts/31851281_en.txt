This study aims to reflect on the process of adoption of the preprints publication model, briefly delimiting its history and current use by the national and the international scientific community. Departing from the literature and a consultation of preprint repositories, this reflection intends to highlight the main challenges that preprint implementation will face in the Nursing area, along with its specificities. While considering its benefits for scientific dissemination, this study points out the difficulties that may arise from the implementation of mostly north-American science models in a peripheral country such as Brazil. This work intends to contribute to an important theoretical discussion, which should precede the significant changes expected from the adoption of such a model in the Brazilian scientific context.
