This is a review of the literature on family caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's disease from 2013 to 2017 available in the BVS, Scopus, and PubMed databases. The descriptors used (translated from Portuguese) were Alzheimer's disease, caregivers, elderly health, by combination. Of the 163 papers analyzed, after applying the relevance test, we selected 26 papers presented from five thematic units: 1- Literature reviews; 2- Prevalence profiles of AD caregivers; 3- Qualitative research that analyzes the feelings and sufferings of caregivers; 4- Comparative studies and objective tests; 5- Evaluation studies of intervention programs. The comprehensive and comparative analysis of the investigations highlighted differences and similarities, advantages, and disadvantages of the samples and methodologies adopted in Brazil and the US. The articles analyzed factors that influence family caregivers' impact with Alzheimer's disease, identifying the affective bonds involved, the expected reciprocity, the physical, emotional, and social costs associated with a prolonged chronic illness and requiring increasingly complex care. Family caregivers and older adults with AD require a broad, accessible, or articulated support network inside and outside the family.
