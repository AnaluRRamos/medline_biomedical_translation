To assess the results of the treatment of fractures of the middle third of the clavicle with a pre-contoured plate in athletes. The authors performed 26 osteosyntheseis in 25 patients with fractures of the middle third of the clavicle. The fractures were classified according to Robinson as 16 type B1 and ten type B2. The mean age was 37 years, ranging from 15 to 63 years, 20 patients were male and five were female, and all play sports in an amateur or professional manner. All patients were operated on in the acute phase of fracture within five days after trauma. Patients were treated with open reduction and internal fixation using pre-contoured plates. The technique and the implant used were the same, but the time of immobilization and rehabilitation protocol were individualized for each patient according to physical activity. Mean follow-up was 16.8 months (6-48 months), with return to sport activities in 45.6 days. Functional assessment was performed using the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) score. The results averaged 34.07 of 35 points. No cases presented nonunion. Only one complication was observed (thrombosis of the subclavian vein with good response to conservative treatment); two patients required implant removal. The surgical treatment of clavicle fractures in athletes presented satisfactory functional outcome and early return sport.
