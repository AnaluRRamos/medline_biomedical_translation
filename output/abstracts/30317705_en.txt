Euthanasia has been discussed since Antiquity. Euthanasia and assisted suicide should be considered under the term 'euthanasia' and under the same definition of 'active and intentional death on demand of the patient, due to administration of medication, resulting from the decision of the physician, being independent of the executor', before being suithanasia, where the administration of medication was performed by the patient, or homothanasia, in the case of the doctor. The designations direct, active and voluntary, currently related to euthanasia should fall into disuse, because it assumes various kinds, of what is false. Greater openness of mindset and broader dialogue, based on scientific evidence and the clarification of definitions and objectives, are essential in the process of liberalizing euthanasia.
