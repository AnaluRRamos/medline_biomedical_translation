The objective was to investigate sleep disorders and associated sociodemographic and behavioral factors. A census of university students was carried out. Questions extracted from the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire investigated: insufficient sleep duration (< 6 hours/day for < 65 years and < 5 hours/day for other ages), long latency (> 30 minutes), low self-rated sleep quality, nocturnal awakenings (involuntary, in the middle of the night), and daytime sleepiness (difficulty concentrating). Independent variables included sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics. Adjusted analyses were performed with Poisson regression. Of the 1,865 students, 32% exhibited insufficient sleep on class days, 8.2% insufficient sleep on weekends, 18.6% long latency on class days, 17.2% long latency on weekends, 30% low self-rated sleep quality, 12.7% nocturnal awakenings, and 32.2% daytime sleepiness. Higher alcohol consumption was associated with insufficient sleep duration and long latency on class days, low quality sleep, awakenings, and daytime sleepiness. Smoking was associated with insufficient sleep duration on weekends, awakenings, and low-quality sleep. Black and brown skin color were associated with insufficient sleep duration on class days, low-quality sleep, and awakenings. Morning classes were associated with insufficient sleep and daytime sleepiness. Female gender was associated with low-quality sleep and awakenings. The most frequent sleep disorders were insufficient sleep on class days, low self-rated quality of sleep, and daytime sleepiness. Alcohol consumption and smoking and black and brown skin color were the principal factors associated with sleep disorders.
