The obturator artery is a branch of the internal iliac artery, although there are reports documenting variations, with origin from neighboring vessels such as the common iliac and external iliac arteries or from any branch of the internal iliac artery. It normally runs anteroinferiorly along the lateral wall of the pelvis to the upper part of the obturator foramen where it exits the pelvis by passing through said foramen. Along its course, the artery is accompanied by the obturator nerve and one obturator vein. It supplies the muscles of the medial compartment of the thigh and anastomoses with branches of the femoral artery on the hip joint. We report a rare arterial variation in a Brazilian cadaver in which the obturator artery arose from the external iliac artery, passing beyond the external iliac vein toward the obturator foramen, and was accompanied by two obturator veins with distinct paths. We also discuss its clinical significance.
