The few existing questionnaires addressing return to work in Brazil are medical and/or psychological and do not examine work environment-related issues. The Obstacles to Return-to-Work Questionnaire (ORTWQ) is multidimensional, including biopsychosocial and environmental factors, and has proven useful in the return to work issue. The scope of this study is to describe the translation and cultural adaptation process of ORTWQ for use in the Brazilian context. It also discusses aspects related to work and the importance for health professionals to identify obstacles to return to work for occupational health vigilance. For the cultural adaptation process, there were five steps: translation, synthesis, back translation, evaluation by an expert committee and the pre-test process. Before the pre-test phase, the Content Validity Index was checked and was considered adequate when it was â‰¥ 0.8. The expression 'increase working hours' was withdrawn from the questionnaire, since the partial returnto-work regime is rare in Brazil. The sample for the pre-test involved 40 individuals. The average time for completing ORTWQ was 14 minutes and the Brazilian version of ORTWQ proved to be adequate. Further studies should assess psychometric qualities of the questionnaire.
