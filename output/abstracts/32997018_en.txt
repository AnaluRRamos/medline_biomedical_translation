What are the repercussions of poorly planned urbanization for population health? Understanding urban health, the risks posed by cities, health repercussions, and urban social relations helps urban planners to decide where to target prevention interventions. We conducted a qualitative descriptive analytical study based on a document analysis and bibliographical review to explore the relationship between urbanization and urban health, focusing on diseases transmitted by the mosquito Aedes aegypti. Our findings show that environmental degradation and inadequate infrastructure pose a serious risk to human health, insofar as the disposal of waste in dumps and landfills can cause exposure to hazardous chemicals. In addition, inadequate urban infrastructure and sanitation is conducive to the transmission of water-borne diseases and the reproduction of vectors of other diseases such as Aedes aegypti, responsible for the transmission of arboviruses (dengue, chikungunya, and Zika). Research on environmental and urban health therefore provides an important foundation for improving the quality of life of people living in cities and developing measures designed to prevent diseases related to unplanned urbanization.
