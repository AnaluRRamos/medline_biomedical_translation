This article discusses trends in health inequalities and access to health services across the regions of Brazil using data from household surveys conducted between 1998 and 2013. Social inequality was measured based on the ratio between the extremes of years of schooling considering two age groups (18 to 59 years and 60 years and over). The findings show a decline in health status and increase in prevalence of diabetes and hypertension in both age groups, which may be related to the expansion of primary healthcare. The findings regarding the percentage of people who had had a medical appointment in the last 12 months show that low levels of inequalities persist despite a general improvement in access. Despite an increase in the percentage of people with up to 3 years of schooling who had had a dental appointment in the last year, significant inequalities persist. The percentage of people who reported being admitted to hospital in the last 12 months was greater among people with up to 3 years of schooling throughout the study period. The hospitalization rate decreased in both age groups across almost all regions. The proportion of women aged between 50 and 69 years with up to 3 years of schooling who had had a mammogram increased, leading to a decrease in inequality. The findings show the need to ensure the continuity of household surveys to monitor inequalities in access to health care services by region and social group.
