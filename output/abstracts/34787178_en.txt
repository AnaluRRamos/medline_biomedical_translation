This study investigated the perception of above ideal body weight among adolescents in the city of Recife, Brazil, and its association with anthropometric profile and lifestyle. A cross-sectional study was conducted with a sample of 2480 adolescents from the 'Study of Cardiovascular Risks in Adolescents.' The conceptual model also assessed demographic and socioeconomic variables. Body weight perception was analyzed by asking the question: 'In your opinion, your current body weight is â€¦ ?' Answers included: below ideal, ideal and above ideal body weight. Statistics were identified using Poisson Regression analysis. The mean age was 14.7 years (SD = 1.6), 53.7% were female, and 70.7% were eutrophic according to the body mass index/age (BMI/A). Perception of body weight was answered by 48.8% of the adolescents. 36.8% and 63.2% saw themselves as below and above their ideal weight, respectively. After adjustments, the variables associated with the perception of body weight above the ideal (outcome variable) were the female sex, age 12 to 14 years, mother's schooling > 8 years, BMI/A in the ideal range, being postpubescent, having breakfast and meals with parents occasionally. Demographic, anthropometric and lifestyle variables were more likely to be associated with body weight perception above the ideal.
