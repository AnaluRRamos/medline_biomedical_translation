This study aimed to assess the structure and process of linkage of mental healthcare, with a focus on services in the Network of Psychosocial Care (RAPS, in Portuguese) and other social and community devices. This was an evaluative study with a qualitative approach through the identification of the RAPS structure and the evaluation of the process of linking mental healthcare in Vit√≥ria da Conquista, Bahia State, Brazil. Semi-structured interviews were held with 33 participants including administrators, professionals, and patients and participant observation in RAPS services. Analytical procedures featured a matrix with three dimensions: structure and composition of RAPS; organization and linkage of RAPS; and comprehensiveness of care and inter-sector linkage. The results showed that despite the expansion of RAPS, the services proved insufficient for meeting the demand, with difficulties in access by users. The linkage between services showed the shaping of a fragmented network, with centralization of specialized services and difficulties in communication with primary care and the emergency care network. The study found a lack of established flows, which left weaknesses in the coordination of care. The development of inter-sector actions, although present, proved to be limited to some sectors. The insufficient structure and segmentation of RAPS were limiting factors for the development of comprehensive and longitudinal mental healthcare.
