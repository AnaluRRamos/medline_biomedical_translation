This article investigates how the santas casas de miseric처rdia charitable associations in the state of S찾o Paulo were subsidized by the municipal, provincial, and state governments at the turn of the twentieth century. Budget appropriations from 1838 to 1915 were examined to evaluate these charitable grants as well as the growth in funding during this period. While a care network created with strong state backing, it was put into action by philanthropic assistance. This network of hospital care retained the same format until at least the first third of the twentieth century, and included miseric처rdia establishments created within the interior of the state of S찾o Paulo.
