The scope of this study was to evaluate the knowledge of the elderly about syphilis and AIDS before and after conducting educational activities. Fifty-five individuals participating in a convenience group from territory of Terrenos Novos in Sobral in the State of Cear√° were selected. To collect the data, a semi-structured questionnaire about HIV/AIDS and syphilis was used, including general features and information about concept, transmission, prevention, vulnerability and treatment. The questionnaire was applied before and after the implementation of educational workshops about AIDS and syphilis. Among those surveyed, 96.4% were aware about AIDS and 67.3% did not know about syphilis. However, 38.1% believed that a kiss on the mouth and 78.1% that mosquito bites were means of HIV transmission. 70.9% did not know the mode of transmission of syphilis. After the workshops the indexes changed positively. Data analysis revealed gaps in knowledge of this group about the concept, transmission and treatment of these diseases. Educational interventions were effective for knowledge assimilation.
