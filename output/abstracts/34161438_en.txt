To propose a protocol for investigating the body balance and determining reference values in different age groups and gender, using the methodology of static posturography with dynamic tests, in low-cost Brazilian equipment for diagnosing balance. The objectives of this study aimed to propose a protocol for investigating the body balance and determining reference values in different age groups and gender, using the methodology of static posturography with dynamic tests, in new low-cost Brazilian equipment for diagnosing balance. Method: 297 healthy volunteers, between 20 and 89 years old, without vestibular complaints, were divided into six groups according to age group and gender. Stability limits and seven sensory conditions named from C1 to C7 were evaluated. The work was carried out using Horus equipment, manufactured in Brazil. The reference values of the stability limit for females and males were obtained according to the ages: from 20 to 59 (≥ 12,594 mm2 and ≥ 19,221 mm2); from 60 to 69 (≥ 7,031 mm2 and ≥ 12,161 mm2); from 70 to 89 (≥ 6,340 mm2 and ≥ 8,794 mm2). For sensory integration tests under conditions C1 to C7, as age increased, the values of the Confidence Ellipse (CE) area also increased. Reference percentile values were established for Residual Functional Balance (RFB) and Sensory Analysis (SA). A protocol was established to investigate body balance via static posturography as well as reference values for normal individuals were determined, according to the different gender and age groups.
