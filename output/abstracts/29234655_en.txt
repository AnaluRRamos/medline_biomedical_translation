Study the clinical characteristics of patients diagnosed with Ewing family tumors (EFTs) and survival analysis based on risk criteria and expression of the surface protein known as insulin-like growth factor (IGFR). This was a retrospective cohort study based on clinical data from 77 patients diagnosed with EFTs treated by the Department of Pediatric Oncology at the Barretos Cancer Hospital in a period between 2003 and 2012. Biological samples of patients were examined for the presence of the surface receptor IGFR. The overall survival rate (OSR) of patients included in the study was 45% at five years, and EFS was 30% at five years. Metastasis at diagnosis was present in 44.2% of the sample; 88.2% of the sample was male (<i>p</i> < 0.001). The evaluation of the expression of IGFR in biological samples of patients was associated with the variable metastasis at diagnosis (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Worse prognosis was observed in patients with extrapulmonary metastasis (<i>p</i> = 0.009). The local treatment of neoplasia presented better prognosis in patients undergoing local surgical treatment (<i>p</i> < 0.001). These results showed a higher incidence of metastasis at diagnosis in patients with EFTs treated at the Barretos Cancer Hospital (BCH). Extrapulmonary metastases were a negative prognostic factor in this study. Surgical treatment of the primary tumor was a factor for better prognosis. Strong expression of IGFR was more frequent in patients with metastases at diagnosis, but did not represent a prognostic factor for EFTs.
