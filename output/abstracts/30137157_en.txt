To investigate self-esteem, body image and depression in adolescents under different nutritional conditions. The study included 418 adolescents (14-18 years old). Four questionnaires were administered: Characterization; Child Depression Inventory; Self-esteem Scale, and Body Image Questionnaire. The nutritional conditions were classified using the Body Mass Index (BMI). Boys had a higher prevalence of overweight or obesity, a lower depression and body dissatisfaction rate, and higher self-esteem than girls (p<0.001). Depression was negatively related to self-esteem (p<0.01), which also had a negative association with body dissatisfaction (p<0.01). Even though adolescents with superior nutritional conditions were more dissatisfied (p<0.001), the BMI was related to body dissatisfaction only in girls (p<0.01). Regarding the relation between depression and body dissatisfaction, it was negative for boys (p<0.01), but positive for girls (p<0.01). Overweight or obese adolescents have higher body dissatisfaction. Depression and self-esteem are related to body image, and not to BMI, demonstrating that the subjectivity of adolescents must be assessed. The differences identified between boys and girls for these relations must be further investigated.
