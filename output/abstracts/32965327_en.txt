Immunization is one of the most effective measures to protect individuals and the population against vaccine-preventable diseases. Vaccines are safe and effective products, but like any other drug they can cause adverse events, which tend to become more visible as the diseases are controlled, eliminated, or eradicated. This study analyzed activities in the surveillance of adverse events following immunization (AEFI) based on data from the scientific literature, websites of immunization programs and health andregulatory agencies, and the authors' expertise in the areas of immunizations and pharmacovigilance. With the increase in the number of vaccines in the basic immunization schedule and expansion of the population's access, it has become essential to establish an efficient surveillance system for AEFI in Brazil. However, underreporting of cases in Brazil and in other countries hinders the detection of AEFI, especially rare events. Constantly updated information on vaccines' risks and benefits allows immunization programs to provide rapid and clear responses to rumors of AEFI. This ensures the system's reliability, especially in the face of the growing antivaccine movement and the increasing influence of social media in public opinion.
