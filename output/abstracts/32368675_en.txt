Rural workers represent the typical population of workers in the Brazilian Pantanal, their work environment being characterized by exuberant fauna and flora, but also countless hazards. The aim of the present study was to analyze work, health and disease aspects of rural workers in Pantanal and the corresponding risk factors. It consists in an integrative review of studies published from 2006 to 2016 located in databases Regional Library of Medicine (BIREME), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO), MEDLINE, PubMed, Periódicos Eletrônicos em Psicologia (PePSIC), the journal portal and dissertation database of the Brazilian Federal Agency of Support and Evaluation of Graduate Education (CAPES), dissertation databases of Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Universidade de São Paulo, Universidade Católica Dom Bosco (Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul) and Universidade Federal do Mato Grosso do Sul, and Google Scholar. We retrieved 27 publications, being 18 scientific studies, 2 PhD and 5 MA dissertations and 2 e-books. Evidenced hazards include accidents involving animals, work overload, and exposure to weather conditions, viruses, bacteria and chemicals, among others. The results point to the need to implement actions considered in public policies for prevention, health promotion and recovery, with particular focus on safety and health at work.
