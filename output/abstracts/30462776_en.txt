To identify studies that evaluated psychometric properties of functional capacity tests in children and adolescents, and to verify which of these have satisfactory properties of measurement. Searches on MEDical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO) databases without limiting period or language. Two investigators independently selected articles based on the following inclusion criteria: children and/or adolescent population (healthy or with cardiorespiratory diseases); and assessment of psychometric properties of functional capacity tests. Studies with (I) adult samples, (II) sample with neurological diseases, and (III) on reference values or prediction equations only were excluded. From the total of 677 articles identified, 11 were selected. These evaluated the psychometric properties of the following tests: 6-minute walk test (6MWT) (n=7); 6MWT and the 3-minute step test (3MST) (n=1); and Incremental Shuttle Walk Test (ISWT) (n=3). Reproducibility and reliability were good for 6MWT and ISWT, and moderate for 3MST. The ISWT showed high validity measures for both healthy children and children with chronic respiratory disease. The validity of 6MWT varied across studies, and should be analyzed according to the health conditions of test takers. The validity of 3MST is unclear, and further studies in pediatric population are required. Most studies investigated 6MWT measurement properties. Validity of 6MWT varied according to different pediatric populations. The use of 6MWT, ISWT and 3MST tests to measure clinically important changes in children and adolescents with cardiorespiratory diseases is still unclear.
