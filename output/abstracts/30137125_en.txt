Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is recognized as a complex disease that requires multiple approaches to its treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of a nutritional intervention program on the nutritional status and quality of life of elderly pre-dialysis CKD patients. A prospective cohort study was carried out involving 64 elderly stage 3 CKD patients receiving treatment at a Primary Care Center in the Municipality of Diadema in the State of São Paulo, Brazil. The nutritional intervention consisted of one individual and three group meetings. Nutritional status was assessed using anthropometric variables and classified according to Body Mass Index (BMI). Cardiovascular risk was classified according to Waist Circumference (WC). Quality of life was assessed using the WHOQOL-BREF. The data was analyzed adopting a significance level of 5%. Mean age was 73.95 ± 7.84 years and the majority of the sample were women, had a low level of schooling, and low monthly income. With respect to nutritional status, 21.9% of the sample were underweight, 32.8% overweight, and 62.6% were at a high or very high risk of developing cardiovascular disease. The nutritional intervention program had a positive impact on nutritional status, leading to a decline in BMI and WC, reduction in risk of developing heart disease, increased satisfaction with current state of health, and improved quality of life.
