The objectives of this study were to identify, among individuals with hypertension, sociodemographic factors associated with non-use of routine medical appointments available in primary care and check if non-use of consultations interferes with noncompliance with pharmacotherapy, uncontrolled blood pressure and hospitalization. This is a cross-sectional study with random and stratified sampling. A total of 422 individuals living in the city of Maringá, Paraná, were interviewed. There were crude and adjusted analyses using logistic regression, estimating odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. It was found that, in the six months preceding the interview, 47 (11.1%) individuals did not use routine appointments. Being male, nonwhite and using only public health services were associated with non-use of consultations. Most of those who did not use consultations also failed to comply with pharmacotherapy and presented dysregulated blood pressure. Healthcare professionals need to develop strategies in order to increase attendance of hypertensive individuals to medical appointments, giving priority to population groups of men, nonwhite individuals and those who use public health services. Greater use of consultations can assist in blood pressure control and reduce complications.
