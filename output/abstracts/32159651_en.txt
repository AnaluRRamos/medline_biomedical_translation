The study aimed to develop a Quantitative Health Inspection Instrument (IQIS) large-sized Brazilian food and nutrition services. The inspection technology based on the Potential Risk Assessment Model (MARP) and the Brazilian Health Legislation was used. Twelve dimensions, 41 modules, and 57 risk control (critical/non-critical) indicators were structured on a scale of 0-5, totalling 1,512 indices with closed-ended response coding. The IQIS was validated with the Kappa Coefficient, with excellent agreement for the attributes of clarity and relevance (k = 0.82 and k = 0.92) and good agreement for applicability (k = 0.78). The Kruskal-Wallis test showed no statistically significant difference between the assessments (p = 0.423), the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient was satisfactory (ICC = 0.53), and Cronbach's Alpha (Î± = 0.71) was acceptable. The final result made it possible to classify the service as having an unacceptable health risk. IQIS is considered to have validated content, be reliable and reproducible to assess the hygienic-sanitary conditions, being a technological innovation for food and nutrition services and sanitary, allowing a detailed and rigorous inspection.
