To analyze the therapeutic approach and its relationship with the economic and social characteristics and the care of children in Centers for Psychosocial Attention. Descriptive study with a sample of 294 children monitored in two Centers for Psychosocial Attention to Children and Adolescents in Fortaleza, Ceará, Northeast Brazil. The study was conducted from February to December, 2012. Participants were accompanied by their parents or caregivers. Data were collected in a structured questionnaire containing social, economic and care variables. The bivariate analysis used the χ2 test to test the association between variables. In this study, 292 children aged 3-12 were selected, following the order of attendance at the service, most of them male (74.3%) and belonging to social classes D and E (89.3%). The most frequent diagnosis referred to by the caregivers was mental disorders. Three different therapeutic approaches were identified: pharmacological approach (44.5%); non-pharmacological approach (11.6%); association of both techniques (43.8%). For all therapeutic approaches, there was association with the variable living situation (p=0.021), as well as with the variables, 'improving' with the treatment (p=0.002) and 'problems' with the treatment (p=0,004). It was possible to highlight that the associated therapeutic approach (pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment) provides more benefits to children. Therefore, associating the medicines to the psychotherapeutic practices may be recommended as a strategy in the mental health policy directed to children and adolescents.
