To describe the baseline developmental profile and influence of clinical and demographic factors on the developmental skills of infants diagnosed with infantile spasms. Ninety-five infants (55 males, 40 females) newly diagnosed with infantile spasms were recruited for a cross-sectional, longitudinal study. All infants underwent Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development assessments in the cognitive, receptive communication, expressive communication, and fine and gross motor developmental domains; they also underwent visual, auditory, and social behaviour assessments. Infants were categorized as 'early' (<6mo) or 'late' (â‰¥6mo) presenters; if presented within 28 days, this was considered as 'early presentation', whereas a delay greater than 28 days was considered as a 'delay in presentation'. Antenatal, perinatal, and postnatal risk factors were identified. Over 90% of infants showed impairment in all domains, with the majority having severe delay; 99% showed cognitive impairment. Delayed presentation was significantly associated with receptive communication delay (odds ratio [OR]=5.35; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.05-27.32). Onset at 6 months or less influenced auditory (OR=2.8; 95% CI=1.16-6.8) and visual (OR=3.03; 95% CI=1.22-7.57) behaviours. Neonatal infections impacted both receptive (OR=1.12; 95% CI=1.04-1.2) and expressive communication (OR=1.08; 95% CI=1.02-1.14) delay. Neonatal seizures significantly influenced visual, auditory, and social impairments. Expressive communication and gross motor development shared common perinatal risk factors. Adverse developmental status at presentation, associated with delayed presentation and neonatal risk factors should alert clinicians to the surveillance of at-risk infants and seek out timely interventions. Ninety per cent of infants showed impaired cognitive, communication, and motor skills at presentation. Visual, auditory, and social behaviour impairments were significantly associated with perinatal risks. Visual, auditory, and social behaviour impairments were significantly associated with neonatal seizures.
