The aim of this study was to investigate the risk and protective factors for suicide attempt in emerging adulthood. 189 individuals (18 to 30 years old) participated in the study: 63 had already attempted suicide, 63 had a history of suicidal ideation, and 63 have never had suicidal ideation. They all completed an online research protocol about suicidal attempt and ideation, anxiety, self-esteem, self-efficacy, developmental stressors; social expression, and friendship. Those participants with no history of suicidal attempt showed higher scores of self-efficacy (M = 35.35, SD = 6.44), self-esteem (M = 41.33, SD = 7.02), and family relationships (M = 59.63, SD = 10.01). The suicidal ideation group showed higher scores of social anxiety (M = 26.03, SD = 10.25). Protective factors were essential to prevent the risk of suicide and help in solving problems in emerging adulthood.
