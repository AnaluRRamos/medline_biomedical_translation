The scope of this study was to establish the prevalence of CKD and associated factors among young adults (18-59 years of age) from Rio Branco in the State of Acre. It involved a population-based survey conducted in 2014, in the urban and rural areas of the municipality and CKD was defined as the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60ml/min/1.73mÂ², estimated by the CKD-EPI, and the presence of albuminuria > 29 mg/g. Association measures were estimated by logistic regression, with a confidence level of 95%. The overall prevalence of CKD was 6.2%. The presence of CKD was higher among women, aged 40 to 59 years, with non-white skin color, with lower schooling, and of sedentary disposition. There were statistically significant differences in the distribution according to the presence of CKD in the hypertension, diabetes and hospitalization variables over the past 12 months. CKD among adults was associated with the female sex (OR: 2.41, 95%CI: 1.14-5.12), diabetes (OR: 4.67, 95%CI: 1.28-17.03) and arterial hypertension (OR: 1.98; 95%CI: 1.16-3.37). CKD reveals a high prevalence and is associated with chronic diseases, calling for the need for public health measures for early detection and prevention of its progression.
