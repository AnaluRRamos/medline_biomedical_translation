This study investigated the associations between the level of physical activity with sociodemographic, environmental and academic factors of adolescents. Two thousand five hundred and forty-five adolescents aged between 14 and 18 from Florian√≥polis and neighboring cities participated in this study. The short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) was used. The prevalence of inactive adolescents was 48.6%, being higher among females (53.9%). For girls, physical inactivity was associated with the lack of appropriate and free places for physical activity (OR = 1.30 95% CI 1.05 to 1.82), with no influence of other variables. For boys who had no professional activity (OR = 1.54 95% CI 1.14 to 2.08), less educated mothers (OR = 0.41 95% CI 0.27 to 0.75), or graduate mothers (OR = 0.35 95% CI 0,17- 0,73), living in major cities (OR = 1.64 95% CI 1.17 to 2.31) and low socioeconomic classification when compared to the average (OR = 0.69 95% CI 0.49 to 0.97) were more prone to physical inactivity. It was observed that the socio-demographic variables were associated with the inactive behavior of boys and environmental variables were associated with the physical inactivity of girls. Among the academic factors, only having to repeat a year was associated with inactivity, and only for girls.
