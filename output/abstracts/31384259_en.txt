Search for conceptual frameworks or models that incorporate aspects of health equity into implementation research and prepare a systematic synthesis of them. A systematic search was done of MEDLINE-PubMed, Embase, and LILACS (1965-2016), and Scopus (1998-2016) databases, employing, in addition, a snowball strategy and gray literature search. Article type was assessed, along with elements that were included on implementation research, the science of implementation, and health equity. A total of 701 articles were found, of which 100 were included for review of relevance. Of these, 19 articles related to conceptual frameworks: 12 were general, five were on ethnic or racial disparities, and two related to child health. The most frequent categories were financing, infrastructure, advocacy, quality, internal barriers, and coverage. The least frequent were other sectors, outpatient needs, health status, and equity impact assessment. In order to reduce health gaps and with them health inequities, it becomes necessary to have a consolidated implementation research framework that includes aspects of health equity. This framework would facilitate improving implementation processes for interventions, services, and health programs.
