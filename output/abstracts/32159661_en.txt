The negative self-perception of health is a relevant construct for the analysis of the elderly population health conditions and should be recognized as a guiding tool for health promotion actions. We aimed to verify the prevalence and the associated factors to a negative self-perception of health by elderly assisted in a reference center. This is an analytical cross-sectional study with convenience sampling conducted in 2015. The negative self-perception association with health-related sociodemographic variables was investigated. Bivariate analysis followed by multiple analysis by Poisson regression was performed to verify the variables associated with the outcome. Three hundred sixty elderly were evaluated. The negative self-perception of health prevalence was 60.5%. The following associated factors were identified in the final model: age range 65-79 years (PR=1; CI95%=0.648-0.974; p=0.027); frailty (PR=1.28; CI95%=1.07-1.54; p=0.007); depressive symptoms (PR=1.40; CI95%=1.19-1.67; p=0.000); and providing care to someone (PR=1.49; CI95%=1.18-1.88; p=0.001). The elevated prevalence of negative self-perception of health and the associated factors point to the need for effective health promotion actions and more specific care for the elderly assisted in the reference center.
