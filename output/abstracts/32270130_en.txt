Workplace violence has potentially high prevalence, in addition to positive correlation with risk of physical and mental disorders, absenteeism, high turnover rates, impaired productivity and poorer organizational climate. Workplace violence is embedded in the work routine, while its manifestations are heterogeneous and vary according to the local culture, work activities and organization. The scientific evidence for the efficacy of interventions to reduce the prevalence of violent incidents is insufficient to ground general recommendations applicable to any occupational activity. Consensus among organizational actors about notions, relevance, prevalence and risk factors associated with workplace violence, based on epidemiological mappings, is necessary, given the subjective and cultural nature of this problem, and also to enable organizational actors to jointly design pilot solutions. This approach is based on methods used in experimental studies and seeks to promote greater adherence to changes.
