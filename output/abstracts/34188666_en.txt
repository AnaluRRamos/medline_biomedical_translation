Most patients with chronic venous disease (CVD) and reflux in the saphenous vein are treated with saphenous stripping or ablation. The venous hemodynamics approach offers the possibility of treating saphenous reflux without eliminating the saphenous vein. We present 2 cases in which venous reflux was eliminated while preserving the great saphenous vein, after treatment with hemodynamic sclerotherapy using a protocol of synergic use of Dextrose and long pulse Nd YAG 1064 laser. These cases show that treating the tributaries responsible for saphenous reflux can correct hemodynamic imbalances and restore normal flow in the great saphenous vein with improvements in symptoms and esthetics. Long-term results are still uncertain.
