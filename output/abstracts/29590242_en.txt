The article aimed to identify the sources of medicines for users of the Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS) that reported chronic non-communicable diseases, characterizing the group according to demographic, socioeconomic, and health variables in the different regions of Brazil. Data were analyzed from the National Survey on Access, Use, and Promotion of Rational Use of Medicines in Brazil (PNAUM), a cross-sectional population-based study. The dependent variable was 'source of medicines', and the associations were analyzed with demographic, socioeconomic, and health status variables. Users that obtained care and medicines solely in the SUS were designated here as SUS-exclusive. Some 39% of persons obtained their medicines from SUS pharmacies and 28.5% from other sources. The study found 42.9%, 41.8%, 40.2%, and 31% of exclusive SUS users in the Southeast, South, North, and Northeast regions of Brazil, respectively. SUS users have the SUS as their primary source of medicines, but there is also a relevant share from other sources, suggesting problems with access in the SUS. In the South and Southeast regions, the population relies less on private pharmacies than in the Northeast and North.
