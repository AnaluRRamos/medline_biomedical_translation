The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has brought challenges related to prevention, protection and care. Coping strategies, such as social distancing, individual protection for the population and workers, increase in the number of intensive care beds, provision of human resources and equipment are necessary actions. However, there are yet no specific effective and safe medicines that justify their use. The challenge imposed on the regulatory framework for medicines is aimed at providing timely access to medicines capable of modifying the course of the disease and leading to better treatment outcomes, with health safety. Regulatory agencies must protect the health by assessing the actual benefits and harms of the medicines under these specific conditions. The article discusses the main regulatory challenges and response of regulatory agencies to the demands imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, especially, drug development strategies and regulatory strategies related to off-label use. Emergency drug use authorization and alternatives for extended/compassionate use are addressed, as well as clinical trials, safety assessment and monitoring of adverse events.
