Spatial understanding of osteoarticular deformities of the foot and ankle is vital to correct diagnosis and therapeutic decision making. Poor reproducibility in conventional standing radiography in three orthogonal views has driven the development of weight-bearing computed tomography (WBCT) technology over the last decade. We analyzed the available literature on WBCT imaging in patients with foot and ankle disorders by performing a literature review of relevant clinical studies in multiple databases including PubMed, MedLine, and Scopus from January 1999 to October 2017. WBCT imaging allows correct evaluation of foot and ankle anatomy with the patient in a standing position, providing images with high spatial resolution, short image acquisition time, low dose of radiation, and costs which are similar to other available imaging technologies. This diagnostic tool can be used for decision making in the treatment of deformities of the ankle, hindfoot, midfoot, and forefoot. Level of Evidence III; Systematic review of level III studies.
