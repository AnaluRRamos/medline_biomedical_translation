The present study presents sources for a history of the Manguinhos Hospital (today the Brazilian National Institute of Infectious Diseases), which for the most part are found in the Archives and Documentation Department of the Casa de Oswaldo Cruz, but also in the administration's own collection (in boxes which are still classified informally) as well as the collection of the Brazilian National Library, in the Mem√≥rias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, and in the Brazilian Ministry of Culture's Audiovisual Technical Center. It also presents a typology of these sources, and shows their analytical potential for the history of health sciences and more specifically, of clinical research, medicine, and public health in Brazil between 1918 and 2018.
