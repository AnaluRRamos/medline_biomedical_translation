The scope of this article was to identify the strategies used for the participation of the patient in healthcare security in hospital and outpatient environments. It involved a systematic review of the literature based on the recommendations of the PRISMA model on the Scopus, WOS and Medline databases. The search was restricted to studies written in Portuguese, English or Spanish conducted between January 2001 and July 2016. Observational, descriptive, qualitative and/or epidemiological studies that described a development/appliance methodology using at least one patient security improvement strategy of inclusion were included. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the randomized Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Thematic analyses were performed in order to analyze the results. After the application of criteria of title, abstract analysis and exclusion, 19 studies were selected. In these studies, patient security strategies that promoted patients' active participation on patient security and information request strategies were identified. In the literature, sundry strategies promoting patient participation on healthcare security, with concrete implementation methods, as well as distinct purposes for their use, were encountered.
