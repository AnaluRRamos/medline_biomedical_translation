Nutrient deficiency is one of the major problems of the human population today. Studies indicate that consumers consider that the price of food is more relevant than its nutritional value. Therefore, this work sought to compare the costs of nutrients provided by typical foods found in the Brazilian diet. Food prices available in virtual markets were collected, and the costs to meet 30% of the daily recommendations for a healthy adult were calculated for eight nutrients. Poultry was found to be the cheapest source of protein. Cereal fiber had the lowest cost for both fiber and iron. The cheapest sources of calcium were Ovaltine and dairy products, whereas cow`s liver was the best ranked food for vitamin A. Vitamin C was found to be the cheapest nutrient in the Brazilian diet, with acerola juice being the cheapest source of this nutrient. Dairy products occupied the first six positions in the ranking of vitamin D, while nuts and seeds were the cheapest sources of vitamin E. The results showed that Brazilian consumers can meet the recommended intake of critical nutrients at a low cost through the purchase of the best ranked foods. However, this ranking should be weighted according to the food quality, as recommended in the New Dietary Guidelines for the Brazilian Population.
