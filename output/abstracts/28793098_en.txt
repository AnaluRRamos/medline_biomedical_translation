the purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of telephone-based support for the metabolic control of elderly patients with diabetes mellitus. a pragmatic study was conducted in two groups, called G1 (n=36) and G2 (n=27), at a health unit from the countryside of SÃ£o Paulo state. Patients in G1 group received telephone support over four months, through 16 telephone contacts with educational material; for the G2 group the educational material was mailed. significant differences were found. The G1 group showed a reduction of the parameters of fasting glucose, as well as systolic and diastolic blood pressure. In G2 group a modest reduction was noted in some parameters, with no significant difference. telephone support was effective to deliver patient education to the diabetic elderly, leading to the reduction of fasting blood glucose. This, combined with other strategies, can contribute to reduce glycated hemoglobin (NCT 01972412).
