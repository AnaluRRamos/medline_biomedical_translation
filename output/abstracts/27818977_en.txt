To evaluate the clinical results among patients undergoing arthroscopic repair of circumferential labral lesions. This was a retrospective study on 10 patients who underwent arthroscopic repair to circumferential labral lesions of the shoulder, between September 2012 and September 2015. The patients were evaluated by means of the Carter-Rowe score, DASH score, UCLA score, visual analog scale (VAS) for pain and Short-Form 36 (SF36). The average age at surgery was 29.6 years. The mean follow-up was 27.44 months (range: 12-41.3). The mean score was 16 points for DASH; 32 points for UCLA, among which six patients (60%) had excellent results, three (30%) good and one (10%) poor; 1.8 points for VAS, among which nine patients (90%) had minor pain and one (10%) moderate pain; 79.47 for SF-36; and 92.5 for Carter-Rowe, among which nine patients (90%) had excellent results and one (10%) good. Joint degeneration was present in one case (10%), of grade 1. We did not observe any significant complications, except for grade 1 glenohumeral arthrosis, which one patient developed after the operation. Arthroscopic repair of circumferential labral lesions of the shoulder through use of absorbable anchors is effective, with improvements in all scores applied, and it presents low complication rates. Cases associated with glenohumeral dislocation have lower long-term residual pain.
