In the last 2 decades, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has become an important procedure for the diagnosis and management of several pancreatic diseases, including pancreatic cancer. This article presents two recently developed EUS-guided techniques for the management of pancreatic cancer: fine-needle tattooing and fiducial placement. Preoperative EUS-guided fine-needle tattooing of small pancreatic tumors helps in precise localization of these lesions during surgery, potentially ensuring adequate margins of resection while preserving healthy pancreatic tissue. In pancreatic cancer patients planned for imaging-guided radiation therapy, EUS-guided fiducial placement improves the accuracy of target delineation during stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). Hydrogel, a new injectable liquid with multimodal visibility recently approved as a liquid fiducial, is currently under investigation in pancreatic head cancer as an EUS-injected spacer to potentially reduce SBRT gastrointestinal wall toxicity. In this article, GRUPUGE presents an updated perspective of these two EUS-guided techniques, addressing their current clinical applications and technical aspects and analyzing existing data on their efficacy and safety.
