To identify the incidence of injuries, their main characteristics, and the way they were managed throughout 2016 in two major series of a professional soccer championship in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. This prospective study used an electronic questionnaire previously developed by the Medical Committee of the Paulista Soccer Federation which was sent to the team doctors after each match. Two hundred and fifty-nine injuries occurred during 361 matches, and the incidence of injury per 1000 hours of game play was 21.32. Strikers were the most affected by injury; the most frequent diagnosis was muscle injury and the legs were predominantly affected. Most of the injuries occurred in the last 15 minutes of the first half and only 7.7% required surgical treatment. Muscle injuries were the most frequent, with most occurring in forwards and in the legs. Approximately half of the injuries occurred after contact and the vast majority was treated without surgery. MRI was the most requested exam and most injuries were classified as moderate (8 to 28 lost play days). <b><i>Level of Evidence III, Study of Non Consecutive Patients; Without Consistently Applied Reference 'Gold' Standard.</i></b>
