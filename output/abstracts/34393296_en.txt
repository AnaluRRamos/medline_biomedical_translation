Pancreas transplantation is a well-established treatment for patients with complicated diabetes mellitus and advanced renal failure. The most common procedure is simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation, in which the pancreas graft is positioned in the right pelvic region and the kidney graft is positioned in the left iliac fossa. Various imaging methods are used for the post-transplantation evaluation of the graft parenchyma and vascular anatomy, as well as for the identification of possible complications. As the number of cases increases, it is fundamental that radiologists understand the surgical procedure and the postoperative anatomy, as well as to recognize the possible postoperative complications and their imaging aspects, with the aim of providing the best guidance in the postoperative management of transplant recipients.
