Analyze the posture of students from the master's degree program in Maternal Health and Obstetrical Nursing; understand how intervention during delivery influences posture; and identify strategies for the prevention of work-related musculoskeletal injuries. Qualitative descriptive study, which recorded and analyzed videos in a learning situation using high-fidelity simulation practice. Thirteen students participated in the study. The results show the adopted body movement does not take into account coordination of the musculoskeletal system to keep body balance, posture and alignment when changing the delivery position. Obstetric nurses have a high prevalence of musculoskeletal injuries, and the specificity of professional activity makes it difficult to assess and prevent risks. Training favors the acquisition of knowledge and reflection of behaviors. Investments should be made in training to students and professionals in work contexts.
