The use of correctly designed animal models is a fundamental step prior to clinical trials in humans. Although rats are easy to house and handle, and have molars that resemble those of humans, very few researchers use them as a model for root canal treatment, probably due to their small size and the lack of relevant data necessary to reproduce the model. Our aims were to describe the anatomic and histologic characteristics of the mandibular first molar of the Wistar rat and present a standardised model for its experimental endodontic treatment. Twenty female rats were used. The characteristics of the mesial and distal roots were described histologically and the quality of the results achieved following the treatment protocol presented herein was assessed by means of digital radiographs, micro- CT and histological sections. The age of 55 days was found to be the most adequate for performing this technique, but we consider the interval of 50 to 60 days to be suitable. Both canals are oval, although in opposite planes, and the furcating-facing walls present the minimum dentine thickness. It was essential to become familiar with these aspects in order to decide upon the most appropriate instrumentation and obturation techniques that would enable replication of this model in basic science research.
