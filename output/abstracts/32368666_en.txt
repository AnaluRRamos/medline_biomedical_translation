Association analysis between common mental disorders (CMD) and working conditions is necessary to achieve a better understanding of the reasons for physical and mental illness among teachers. In the present cross-sectional study we sought to establish the prevalence of CMD among teachers in public municipal elementary schools in Uberl√¢ndia, Minas Gerais, Brazil, and its correlation with sociodemographic, environmental and occupational aspects. A random sample of 330 teachers from 36 schools responded the General Health Questionnaire-12 and a structured questionnaire designed to investigate risk and protective factors for CMD. The collected data were first subjected to bivariate, then to multiple logistic regression analysis. The results indicate that the following characteristics were associated with CMD: female sex, permanent employment relationship, working double shifts, previous experience with school violence and use of sleep disorder drugs. We conclude that the mental health of teachers does not receive the proper attention and care even though it has direct impact on the teaching-learning cycle. Decreasing the rates of absenteeism, presenteeism, turnover, early retirement and sick leave reduces the government's costs, while positive impacts extend to society at large.
