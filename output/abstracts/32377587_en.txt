To establish the sociodemographic, occupational and clinical profile of labor readjusted workers at a public hospital. Cross-sectional study conducted with 40 labor readjusted workers at a university hospital in SouthernBrazil. Datacollection was performed by means of an instrument with questions for sociodemographic, occupational and clinical profile. Descriptive analysis of relative and absolute frequencies was performed. Female sex (72.5%), age range 54 to 59 years old (35%) and technical education level (37.5%) predominated. Most labor readjusted workers were members of the nursing staff (62.5%), and the main reasons for readjustment were musculoskeletal mental and behavioral disorders. One might infer that labor readjustment might related to factors present in the hospital work environment.
