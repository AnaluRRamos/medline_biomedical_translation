Studies conducted with prehospital urgent care workers investigated work-related stress and its repercussions on the workers' mental and physical health. To identify risk factors for development of work-related cardiovascular (CVD) and musculoskeletal (MSD) diseases among prehospital emergency care workers. We conducted a systematic search on databases PubMed, EBSCO, EMBASE and Science Direct. The inclusion criteria were: risk factors for CVD and MSD among prehospital emergency care workers. From 370 articles, 11 were included for review. The included studies identified risk factors for CVD, such as body mass index and sedentary lifestyle, however, with limited level of evidence. For MSD, age and working as first responder were shown to behave as risk factors, with high level of evidence. We were not able to determine the cardiovascular risk factors due to lack of studies that analyzed this aspect. The most evident musculoskeletal risk factors reported in the literature are age and working as first responder. Registration PROSPERO: CRD42016042390.
