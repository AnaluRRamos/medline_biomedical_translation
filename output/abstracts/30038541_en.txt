This study addresses functional data, pain, and the reoperation rate in patients undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) during which the patella was or was not replaced. Fifty-three knees were included, 18 with the patella replaced and 35 with the patella not replaced. WOMAC and SF-12 scores and knee pain were analyzed preoperatively and 3, 6, and 12 months after TKA. The reoperation rate was also evaluated. Both groups presented significant improvement in WOMAC score and pain at all postoperative follow-up appointments. There was no significant difference between the groups in all evaluated variables. Two subjects in the group did not undergo patellar replacement due to complaints of anterior knee pain after arthroplasty. There was no difference between the groups in relation to the reoperation rate. Patients receiving patellar replacement during TKA did exhibit significant differences in the rate of reoperation, function, or pain when compared to patients in which the patella was replaced. <b><i>Level of Evidence III; Cohort study.</i></b>
