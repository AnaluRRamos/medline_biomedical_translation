Compare acoustic and aerodynamic voice measures between male and female singers. A cross-sectional, observational, comparative study conducted with a convenience sample. Study participants were 30 male and 30 female singers. Acoustic (vocal intensity and fundamental frequency) and aerodynamic (expiration time, air pressure, expiratory and voice airflow, expiratory volume, aerodynamic power and resistance, acoustic impedance, and aerodynamic efficiency) measures were assessed during emission of the syllable /pá/, at usual frequency and intensity, for seven consecutive times. These emissions enable extraction of air pressure measures (obtained by the plosive consonant /p/, which estimates glottic pressure), as well as of airflow and acoustic voice measures (obtained by the vowel /a/ and the syllable /pá/). Women presented higher values of fundamental frequency compared with those of men. No differences were identified in the evaluation of aerodynamic measures between the groups. Values of aerodynamic measures do not differ between male and female singers.
