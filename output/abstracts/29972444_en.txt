This study aimed to correlate sleep profile and behavior in individuals with Specific Learning Disorder (SLD). The Sleep General Habits Questionnaire, Sleep Diary, and Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children (SDSC) were used in analysis of sleep, whereas the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) inventory was used in analysis of behavior. 65.5% of the individuals with SLD presented symptoms of sleep disorders, most frequently wakefulness-sleep transition and sleep disturbance total score, which showed values higher than acceptable. In addition, individuals with SLD presented higher sleep latency than those with typical development. Concerning behavior, 72.4% of the individuals with SLD presented clinical condition of behavior problems. In the control group, none of the participants showed symptoms of sleep or behavior problems. In the SLD group, correlation was observed between behavioral problems and sleep disturbance. Individuals with SLD showed high rates of sleep disturbance and behavioral problems. The worse the sleep disturbance, the worse the behavioral aspects in these individuals.
