To determine the correlations between coping strategies, depression, stress levels and pain perception in patients with endometriosis. This prospective and exploratory study included 171 women undergoing treatment for endometriosis between April and August 2014. The questionnaires used were Brief COPE, Beck Depression Inventory, Lipp's Stress Symptom Inventory for Adults and Visual Analogue Scale. Clinical data were collected from electronic medical records. Patients with endometriosis who used positive coping strategies had better adaptation to stress (p<0.004) and less depression (p<0.004). The presence and intensity of depression, stress and acyclic pelvic pain were directly associated (p<0.05). The intensity of dysmenorrhea was associated with the degree of depression (p<0.001), whereas acyclic pelvic pain was associated with the degree of depression (p<0.001), stress level (p<0.001) and stress type (p<0.001). We found a positive association between coping, depression levels, type and levels of stress and pain intensity in patients with endometriosis. The use of maladaptive coping strategies focused on emotion is correlated with increase in depression and stress.
