Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency is one of the most frequent inborn conditions. It is caused by distinct mutations in the CYP21A2 gene and in the majority of cases the disease's severity correlates with CYP21A2 allelic variation Our aim was to describe the mutational spectrum of CYP21A2 and evaluate genotype-phenotype correlation in a cohort of portuguese patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Retrospective study of 22 patients with clinical diagnosis of 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Molecular analysis of CYP21A2 was performed and genotype-phenotype correlation was then established. Genotyping was performed in 22 unrelated patients: 5 with classic salt-wasting (average age of diagnosis 10,2 days; minimum 1, maximum 20 days), 7 with classic simple virilizing (average age of diagnosis 3,5 years; minimum 0 days, maximum 7 years) and 10 with nonclassical form (average age of diagnosis 5,7 years; minimum 4 years, maximum 8 years). The most frequent genetic defects in the classic forms were I2 splice (24%) and I172N (24%), followed by Q318X (16%) and gene deletions (16%) and in the nonclassical form, the V281L (80%). The overall concordance between genotype and phenotype was 81,8%. Genotype accurately predicted phenotype in 83,3%, 100% and 90% of patients with classic salt-wasting, classic simple virilizing and nonclassical mutations, respectively. The frequency of genetic defects in our patients was comparable to similar studies. In most cases there was a good correlation between genotype and phenotype. Molecular analysis of CYP21A2 provides useful information in terms of prediction of disease severity, genetic and prenatal counseling.
