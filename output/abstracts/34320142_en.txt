To analyze factors associated with diabetic foot risk in patients with diabetes mellitus assisted in Primary Care. Observational, analytic, and transversal study took place in Teresina, Piau√≠, with diabetic patients who are assisted in Primary Care. Data collection took place through interviews, foot clinical exams, and medical record analysis. We used the Mann-Whitney, Pearson's Chi-square and multiple logistic regression statistics tests to analyze the data. The association power among categorical variables was measured by Odds Ratio . 322 patients participated. Marital status with a partner presented a protection factor (p = 0.007). Risk factors for the development of the diabetic foot are: arterial hypertension (p = 0.045), obesity (p = 0.011), smoking (p = 0.027), not being submitted to follow ups (p = 0.046), inadequate control of capillary blood glucose (p < 0.001), indisposition to the care of the foot (p=0.014), and foot self-exam less frequently (p = 0.040). Sociodemographic, clinical, and self-care aspects interfere in diabetic foot development, highlighting the necessity of effective follow up tracking and educational interventions for patients with diabetes mellitus in Primary Care.
