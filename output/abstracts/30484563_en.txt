The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between psychosocial risks and burnout syndrome in a long-stay hospital in Spain. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2017, applying the Spanish version of the MBI-HSS and the F-Psico 3.1 questionnaire of Spain's National Institute of Work Safety and Health. The predictive variables were sociodemographic characteristics, modulators, and psychosocial risk factors. The outcome variables were prevalence of burnout and the effects on his subscales. Associations between variables were measured by odds ratio. Burnout was directly associated with psychosocial risks related to workload, psychological demands, participation/supervision, role performance and social support, and consumption of anxiolytics. Meanwhile, protective factors were having children, feeling valued by patients and coworkers, satisfaction at work, optimism, and social support. The associations found on depersonalization were similar but weaker. Low personal fulfillment was directly associated with the psychosocial risks related to length of workweek, limited autonomy and variety/content of work, and role performance and social support. Low personal fulfillment was the subscale with the most modulating and protective sociodemographic variables included marital status, children, night shift, feeling valued by patients and family members, social support, self-efficacy, and optimism. According to our results, there is an association between psychosocial risks and burnout syndrome. Individuals with greater work satisfaction, self-efficacy, and optimism cope better with stress and are less vulnerable to psychosocial risks and burnout.
