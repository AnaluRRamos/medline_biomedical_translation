To describe the epidemiological profile of victims of cardiac arrest assisted using a nontransporting emergency medical service vehicle and to determine whether these patients met the criteria for the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. This study employed a retrospective, cohort, descriptive, and exploratory design. Data were collected in January 2018 in northern Portugal by consulting the records of nontransporting emergency medical service vehicles that provided assistance between 2012 and 2016. An observation grid was prepared that was supported by the instrument used for collecting data from the national registry of out-ofhospital cardiac arrests. After applying the inclusion criteria, the sample consisted of 36 victims. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation could have been applied to 24 victims during the period analyzed, which might have increased the odds for transplantation, survival, or both, for either the victim or other individuals. Nontransporting emergency medical service vehicles have the potential for inclusion in the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation network of the study area.
