Neurological diseases are estimated to affect 1 billion people worldwide and are the cause of one in 10 deaths. In Brazil, they are responsible for approximately 14% of clinical admissions to intensive care units, 9% of elective neurosurgeries and 14% of emergency neurosurgeries. Many of these conditions are incurable, result in reduced life expectancy and quality of life and increased dependence, and are associated with symptoms that are likely to cause suffering, which justifies the integration of palliative care into usual care. In addition, factors unique to acute neurological injuries, such as their catastrophic clinical presentation, complex and uncertain prognosis, associated communication difficulties and issues related to quality of life, require a specific approach, which has recently been termed 'neuropalliative care'. Although the topic is relevant and current, it is still little discussed, and much of what is known about palliative care in this context is extrapolated from approaches used under other conditions. Therefore, the objective of this study was to conduct a narrative literature review to identify the challenges of applying the palliative care approach in the care of neurocritically ill patients, with a focus on three groups: neurocritically ill patients, families and intensive care teams. This review identified that in intensive care, the main demands for palliative care are for prognostic definitions and care planning. Training in primary palliative care and improving communication were also needs identified by intensivists and families, respectively. In contrast with what has been found under other conditions, the management of symptoms was not indicated as a complex issue, although it is still relevant.
