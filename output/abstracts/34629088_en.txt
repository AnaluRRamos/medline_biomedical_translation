Understanding the characteristics of multiple infections is critical in the era of HPV multivalent vaccines for the prevention of cervical carcinomas. Therefore, in this cross-sectional study, we aimed to investigate the pattern of multiple HPV infections and associated factors in 5,268 sexually active unvaccinated women (16–25 years old) who access the Brazilian public health care system. Cervical samples were collected by trained health professionals, and HPV detection was performed in a central laboratory by Linear Array. A total of 33.00% (95% CI 31.07–34.92) had multiple infections (60.43% of the HPV-positive sample). The number of HPV types in a multiple infection ranged from 2 to 14 different types. The viral types more frequently identified were HPV 16 and 52. All HPV types were detected more frequently in association with other types than alone. The incidence of multiple infections was 1.29 times higher in single than in married or cohabitating participants. Women who had two or more partners in the last year also had higher rates of multiple infections than those who had fewer than two sexual partners. In conclusion, a high prevalence of multiple infections prior to the national HPV immunization program was observed, especially with the increase in less safe behavior factors.
