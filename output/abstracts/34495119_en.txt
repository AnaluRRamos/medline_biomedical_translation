This article revisits Maximilian zu Wied's Viagem ao Brasil (1815-1817) in terms of the value of this naturalist prince's expedition records for natural history, especially the survey of flora in what is currently south Bahia. The general characteristics of scientific production in the field of natural history and nineteenth-century travel reports are analyzed, as well as the bibliographic profile of the traveler. The main objective is to demonstrate how the naturalist's relationship with indigenous peoples emerged in producing the flora inventory, highlighting the importance of indigenous knowledge and practices to the European naturalist's work.
