The Immunization Program of Cuba was created in 1962 as a result of the political, economic and social transformations initiated in 1959, when communicable diseases -among them those preventable by vaccines- were the main cause of morbidity and mortality in children. Its organization and uninterrupted implementation allowed that six diseases, two serious clinical forms and two serious complications were eliminated, and the remaining ones have incidence and mortality rates that do not represent a health problem. In Cuba, an average of 4.8 million doses of simple or combined vaccines are administered annually protecting against 13 diseases, including a pentavalent vaccine whose five components are produced in the country. Oral polio vaccination in the 1962 campaign was the first experience in the Region of the Americas with community and intersectoral participation, and Cuba was the first country to eliminate the disease. Recent results of Cuban research have influenced the World Eradication Program. The universal vaccination against hepatitis B at 24 hours after birth was achieved 19 years before the goal set by the World Health Organization using a national vaccine. In Cuba, vaccination is free and it is integrated into primary health care, with universal access. The commitment and political will to the health of the population is conveyed through a comprehensive health system. Information and epidemiological surveillance are systematic, reliable and sensitive. Vaccination coverage is above 98% for all vaccines and the population has a high immune level.
