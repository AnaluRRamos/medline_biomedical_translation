This study evaluated the internal morphology of lower incisors using computerized microtomography (micro-CT) images. Eighty-nine lower incisors were scanned by micro-CT and reconstructed with NRecon software. 2D parameters (perimeter, root length, circularity and canal diameter) and 3D parameters (volume, surface area and structure model index) were evaluated with CTAn and CTVol software. The results are presented descriptively. It was found that 89.9% of the canals had a single main root canal (type I), followed by type II (6.7%) and III (3.4%), while 5.6% of the specimens presented lateral canals and 1.1% had an apical delta. Mean volume and surface area were 31.80mm³ and 90.58mm², respectively. The most prevalent shape of the root canal at CEJ level was circular (41.6%) and 1mm from the apex, 73% of the samples were classified as oval. Lower incisors with internal anatomical variations may offer a high degree of technical complexity and may result in treatment failure.
