This study focuses on the contribution by German sociologist Norbert Elias (1897-1990) to the theme of aging and death. A reading of Elias' work allows reconsidering his analyses and perspectives on the thresholds of aging and death in societies with different demographic histories. Norbert Elias addressed these issues in The Loneliness of the Dying, published in 1982 in Germany and with an expanded version in 1985 in England. The author delves into his own experience with aging as inspiration for constructing his work, referring to his personal history and career as a social scientist, dialoguing with both the social and human sciences and with knowledge in the field of health. Elias endeavors to understand how the aging body is experienced and represented by the elderly person and how younger people grasp the processes and stages of advancing age. His thinking is attuned to the multiplicity of metaphors and meanings on finitude, on processes of aging and rites of passage in 'younger' societies or more demographically 'mature' ones. These are the concerns and inquiries of Norbert Elias that we will reflect on, in dialogue with his studies on finitude or the final moments of existence.
