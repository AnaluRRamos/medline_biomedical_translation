To evaluate the functional outcome of patients with traumatic brachial plexus injury undergoing the Oberlin procedure. Eighteen patients were assessed, comprising 17 men (94.4%) and 1 woman (5.6%), mean age 29.5 years (range 17-46 years), with upper traumatic brachial plexus injury (C5-C6 and C5-C7). We assessed active range of motion of the elbow, elbow flexion muscle strength and hand-grip strength, and applied the DASH (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand) questionnaire. Four patients (22.2%) did not achieve effective elbow flexion strength (BMRC Grade 3). Mean active range of motion was 100.2° (±45.6°), and we observed a mean percentage of strength recovery relative to the contralateral limb of 35.5% (0-66.3%). Elbow flexion (p = 0.0001) and hand-grip (p = 0.0001) strength levels were lower on the affected side. The surgical technique described by Oberlin for brachial plexus injuries proved effective for restoring elbow flexion and produced no functional sequelae in the hand. Bicep strength outcomes were better when surgery was performed within 12 months of injury. <b><i>Level of evidence II, retrospective study.</i></b>
