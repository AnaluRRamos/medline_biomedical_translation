The aim of this cross-sectional hospital-based study of 7,845 pregnancies was to analyze deaths of women hospitalized for childbirth and abortion, and fetal and neonatal deaths, in public hospitals in the cities of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Niteroi (RJ), Brazil, in 2011. Outcomes of the pregnancies were: one maternal death, 498 abortions, 65 fetal deaths, 44 neonatal deaths and 7,291 infant survivors. Data were collected through interviews, medical records and the women's pregnancy records, and from the Mortality Information System (SIM). The study population was described and kappa coefficients of causes of death (from the SIM, and certified by research) and mortality health indicators were estimated. The maternal mortality ratio was 13.6 per 100,000 live births (LB), the fetal death rate was 8.8‰ births and the neonatal mortality rate was 6.0‰ LB. The drug most used to induce abortion was Misoprostol. The main causes of fetal and neonatal deaths were respiratory disorders and maternal factors. Congenital syphilis, diabetes and fetal death of unspecified cause were under-reported in the SIM. Kappa coefficients by chapter were 0.70 (neonatal deaths) and 0.54 (stillbirths). Good quality care in reproductive planning, prenatal care, during labor and at birth will result in prevention of deaths.
