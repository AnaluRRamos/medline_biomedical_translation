Radiologists should be familiar with the main techniques of knee cartilage repair and the imaging methods available for its evaluation, in order to optimize the postoperative follow-up of patients. The objective of this study was to present a series of clinical cases seen at our facility, illustrating the main techniques necessary for the repair of knee cartilage, as well as the magnetic resonance imaging techniques used in the postoperative evaluation and the relevant radiological findings.
