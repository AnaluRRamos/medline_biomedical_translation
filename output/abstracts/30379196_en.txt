This study aims to verify the immediate and medium-term effects of an intensive voice therapy, with progression of vocal intensity and frequency and phonation time, on the voice and larynx of two elderly. A 79-year-old male and an 82-year-old female with vocal complaints and presbylarynx characteristics underwent 12 sessions of intensive voice therapy, with progression of voice intensity and frequency and phonation time, for three weeks. To analyze the therapeutic effects, the following assessments were performed pre-, post-immediately, and one month after voice therapy: auditory-perceptual analyses of the voice, acoustic analysis, and evaluation of maximum phonation time (MPT), self-reference voice-related quality of life, and laryngeal behavior. Most results of these measurements indicated positive changes immediately after voice therapy. There was reduction in the measures of vocal quality deviation, perturbation, and harmonics-to-noise pre-, post-immediately, and one month after voice therapy, which indicates vocal improvement. There was increase in fundamental frequency, maximum phonation time and self-reference voice-related quality of life. Assessment of the laryngeal images showed no consistent difference. One month after voice therapy, worsening of some results was observed compared with the post-immediate assessment, but improvements were maintained in relation to the initial evaluation. The results of this therapeutic proposal are promising, and their effects should be investigated in controlled clinical trials to verify their efficacy.
