The scope of this article is to present a theoretical-methodological model as the basis for the analysis of the potential provision of Brazilian public health services (SUS) using an approach based on complex network theory. The model sought to analyze the potential provision of health services through the relationship of Euclidean distance between census sectors and services offered by health facilities, as defined in the National Register of Health Establishments (CNES). Two types of metrics are proposed for the analysis of the relationship network: the average distance of health services to the census sectors and the importance of the health unit in the potential provision of each type of service based on the centrality and availability of this service. To demonstrate the application of the model, a network was built based in the Metropolitan Area of Brasilia, including the Federal District and 12 surrounding municipalities. The model was able to map and analyze CNES data with census sectors defined in the CENSUS, opening up the possibility of constructing new perspectives of analysis in the understanding of the potential distribution of health resources and services according to socioeconomic variables, as well as an important evidence-based management tool.
