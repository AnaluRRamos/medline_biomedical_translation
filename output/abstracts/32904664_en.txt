To assess the practical aspects of the use of various gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) by radiologists. Ten experienced radiologists from different regions of Brazil participated in a Delphi panel querying their use of various GBCAs, including linear and macrocyclic classes (1.0 and 0.5 M), in terms of the choice of agent, volume and dosage of the agents, and associated safety concerns. The response rate was 100% for all questions. GBCAs are safe in terms of acute adverse reactions, and nephrogenic systemic fibrosis is rare. The deposition of gadolinium in the brain and other tissues is a concern among the experts. Macrocyclic agents are preferable to linear agents; an injection volume below 0.1 mL/kg of a 1.0 M agent could result in good-quality images with additional long-term safety, but there is no published evidence to support this recommendation. The majority of experts preferred not to administer GBCAs to pregnant patients. When choosing a GBCA, it is important to consider the characteristics of the gadolinium deposition in patient tissues and minimize potential risks. Furthermore, medical education programs are needed to increase the awareness of the potential risks of gadolinium deposition and thus avoid instances of overexposure to the contrast agent.
