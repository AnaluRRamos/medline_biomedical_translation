This cross-sectional study evaluated the association of biopsychosocial factors with disability in older adults with a new episode of acute low back pain. Older patients with a new episode of acute low back pain were included and those with cognitive alterations and severe motor impairment were excluded. Disability was assessed using the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire. The biopsychosocial factors (clinical, functional, health status, psychological and social variables) were evaluated by a structured multidimensional questionnaire and physical examination. A multivariate linear regression was used to analyze data with a statistical significance of 0.05. A total of 386 older individuals with a mean age of 71.6 (± 4.2) years and disability of 13.7 (± 5.7) points were enrolled. Our regression analyses identified that worse physical and mental health (assessed through SF-36), low falls self-efficacy, trouble sleeping due to pain, worse kinesiophobia levels, higher body mass indexes, lumbar morning stiffness, increased pain intensity, female gender and worse functional mobility were significantly associated with baseline disability (p < 0.05). Low back pain-related disability is significantly associated with worse biopsychosocial health conditions in older adults.
