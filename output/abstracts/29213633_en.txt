To study the integrity of hemispheric subcortical white matter by comparing normal young and elderly subjects using quantitative fractional anisotropy (DTI-FA). Subjects of two different age groups (young=12, elderly=12) were included. MR - GE Signa Horizon - 1.5T scans were performed. Cases with Fazekas scores =3 were assessed on FLAIR sequence. Standard parameters for DTI-FA were used. ROIs were placed at various sites of the subcortical white matter, and the genu and splenium of the midline corpus callosum. Analysis was performed using Functool. Statistics for anterior and posterior white matter, as well as the genu and splenium were compared between the groups. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of IPUB-UFRJ and informed consent obtained. DTI-FA showed lower anisotropy values in the anterior region (subcortical white matter and genu), but not in the posterior region (subcortical white matter and splenium), in elderly normal subjects compared to young subjects. The results may represent loss of integrity of anterior (frontal) white matter fibers in the elderly subjects. These fibers constitute important intra- and inter-hemispheric tracts, components of neural networks that provide cognitive, behavioral, motor and sensory integration. The loss of integrity of the anterior segments of the studied fiber systems with ageing, represents a disconnection process that may underlie clinical manifestations found in elderly subjects such as executive dysfunction.
