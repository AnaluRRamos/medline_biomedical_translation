The scope of this study was to examine the risk factors for the development of obesity in adolescence. The objective was to identify risk factors for adolescent obesity by means of an Integrative Review of the Literature. The PICO strategy was used to formulate the following central line of inquiry: What are the risk factors for the development of obesity during adolescence? The VHL and EBSCOhost research databases were consulted, resulting in a selection of 25 articles for in-depth study. The phenomenon of obesity was understood as the result of biological, social, psychological, and nutritional factors. The research revealed a lack of consensus on the risks and benefits, which makes evidence-based recommendations difficult. The study identified proposals that can be implemented, such as a change in eating habits, weight control and the practice of physical exercise. Such behavioral changes can be recommended within the context of the family, schools, and health services. The review recommends prevention strategies and the recognition of school as the ideal medium for health promotion through education. From a political and social standpoint, it is necessary to challenge the prevalence of publicity of the food industry that entices adolescents to consume processed foods with high fat and sugar content.
