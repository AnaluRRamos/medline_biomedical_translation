Hermann Rorschach was a Swiss psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, best known for developing a projective test known as the Rorschach inkblot test, a test designed to reflect unconscious parts of the personality that project into the visual stimuli generated by the inkblots, allowing a psychodiagnosis to be established. The technique he developed has been applied since 1921 in a number of countries. Although it has long remained controversial and divided opinions, this did not prevent it from overcoming the barriers of science to have a major influence on pop culture, resulting in an undeniable legacy for the development of Psychiatry in the nineteenth century.
