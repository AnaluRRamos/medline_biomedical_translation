Dementia prevalence is increasing in developing countries due to population aging. Brief tests for assessing cognition and activities of daily living are very useful for the diagnosis of dementia by the clinician. Low education, particularly illiteracy, is a hindrance to the diagnosis of dementia in several regions of the world. To compare the Brazilian version of the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument-Short Form (CASI-S) with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Pfeffer Functional Activities Questionnaire (PFAQ) for the diagnosis of dementia in illiterate elderly. A cross-sectional study with illiterate elderly of both genders seen at the outpatient clinics of the Institute of Gerontology and Geriatrics Jundiaí, São Paulo state was performed. Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to correlate CASI-S, MMSE and PFAQ scores. The sample comprised 29 elderly over 57 years old whose mean scores on the CASI-S (scores ranging from 3 to 23) and the MMSE (scores ranging from 2 to 23) were 11.69 and 12.83, respectively. There was a strong significant correlation between the CASI-S and MMSE (r=0.75, p<0.001) and a moderate correlation coefficient that was significant and negative between the PFAQ and CASI-S (r= -0.53 p=0.003),similar to that between the MMSE and PFAQ (r= -0.41 p=0.025). The Brazilian version of the CASI-S demonstrates ease of application and correction in the illiterate elderly, and warrants further studies regarding its applicability for the diagnosis of dementia in populations with a heterogeneous educational background.
