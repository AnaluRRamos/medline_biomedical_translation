To evaluate the progression of the contralateral hip after unilateral reconstruction of hip dislocation in patients classified as GMFCS IV-V; and to identify potential prognostic factors for their evolution. This was a retrospective study on 17 patients with spastic cerebral palsy, who were classified on the GMFCS scale (Gross Motor Functional Classification System) as degrees IV and V, and who underwent unilateral reconstruction surgery to treat hip dislocation (adductor release, femoral varus osteotomy and acetabuloplasty). The minimum postoperative follow-up was 30 months. The clinical parameters evaluated were sex, age at time of surgery, length of follow-up after surgery and range of abduction. The treatment parameters were use/nonuse of femoral shortening, application of botulinum toxin and any previous muscle releases. The radiographic parameters were Reimer's extrusion index (REI), acetabular angle (AA) and the continuity of Shenton's line. Among the 17 patients evaluated, eight presented dislocation (group I) and nine did not (group II). Group I comprised three males and five females; group II comprised one male and eight females. The mean age at the time of surgery among the group I patients was 62 months and the mean follow-up was 62 months. In group II, these were 98 and 83 months, respectively. There was a trend in which patients of greater age did not evolve with contralateral dislocation. Among the nine patients with the combination of REI < 30% and AA < 25°, only one presented dislocation during the follow-up. Contralateral subluxation occurred within the first two years after the surgery. Hips presenting REI < 30° and AA < 25° do not tend to evolve to subluxation and can be kept under observation. Preoperative clinical and radiographic measurements alone are not useful for indicating the natural evolution of non- operated hips. The critical period for subluxation is the first two years after surgery.
