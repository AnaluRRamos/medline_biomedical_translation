Ports play a substantial role in the Brazilian economy.Despite the large number of port workers, few studies report that the most common musculoskeletal disorders among them involve the upper limbs, including carpal tunnel syndrome, rotator cuff syndrome, cervicalgia and cubital tunnel syndrome.The latter is a neuritis caused by compression of the ulnar nerve at the cubital tunnel (CuTS) on the elbow. To estimate the prevalence of a suggestive diagnosis of CuTS among port workers. Seventy-two independent port workers registered with the Labor Management Organ (Órgão Gestor de Mão de Obra - OGMO), Port of Saint Sebastian, were evaluated based on a semi-structured questionnaire and clinical examination, including investigation of pain on palpation of the middle area of the elbow and two maneuvers specific for CuTS, namely, the pressure provocation and maximal flexion tests. The average age of the participants was 48.49 years old, and their average length in the job 23.13 years.Suggestive diagnosis of CuTS was established for five participants.In only two cases elbow pain had begun before, and in three after starting work at the port. The prevalence of a suggestive diagnosis of CuTS was 6.9%, and was higher among the participants with longer length in the job (over one year).
