Warm-water immersion foot (WWIF) is associated with prolonged contact with water at high temperature. Car wash workers are frequently exposed to humidity, however, there are not studies targeting diseases affecting this category of employees. To investigate the frequency of WWIF among car wash workers. The study was carried out in 2013 at a car wash service in Jundiaí, São Paulo, Brazil. A group of 30 workers was subjected to clinical interview and dermatological examination. Statistical tests were performed to assess the association between WWIF and independent variables. All the participants were male, their average age was 23 years old, and the most (60%) had worked at the investigated company for more than one year. Sixty percent of the participants exhibited lesions compatible with WWIF. Age and length of work at the company were associated with the assessed outcome. The participants were frequently and permanently exposed to humidity along the working day without wearing impermeable clothes. Most participants exhibited WWIF; the ones over 30 years old and having worked less than 1 year at the investigated company exhibited higher odds of WWIF due to occupational exposure to humidity.
