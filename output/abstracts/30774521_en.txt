The aim of this study was to verify whether the Pirani and Dimeglio clinical scoring systems could predict results of Ponseti therapy. Forty-seven patients with clubfoot deformities treated with the Ponseti method were enrolled in the study. Clinical evaluation with the Pirani and Dimeglio scoring systems was performed before the treatment and after the second cast fixation. The number of fixations, necessity for achillotomy, and recurrence of the deformity were determined as parameters of the therapy results. The patients were divided into three groups according to the severity of their deformities, and the groups were compared with one another. Clubfoot correction required an average of 6.8 casts. Five patients developed a recurrence. Comparing the therapy outcomes among the groups, we found statistically significant differences in the Pirani classification after the second fixation (the number of casts [p =.003] and necessity to perform an achillotomy [p =.014]) and in the Dimeglio scores before therapy (number of casts [p =.034]) and after the second fixation (number of relapses [p =.032]). Although clinical scoring systems showed some dependence on the parameters of treatment outcomes, their predictive function can be used in only a limited way. <i><b>Level of evidence II, Prospective comparative study.</b></i>
