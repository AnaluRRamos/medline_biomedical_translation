To analyze the use of health services and the quality of medical care received by Brazilian older adults with and without functional limitation. The main analyses were based on a national sample representing 23,815 participants of the National Survey on Health (PNS) aged 60 years or older. Functional limitation was defined by the difficulty to perform at least one out of ten basic or instrumental activities of daily living. Potential confounding variables included predisposing and enabling factors of the use of health services. The prevalence of functional limitation was 30.1% (95%CI 29.2-31.4). The number of doctor visits and hospitalizations in the past 12 months showed statistically significant associations with functional limitation, both for users of the public system (OR = 2.48 [95%CI 2.13-2.88] for three or more doctor visits and OR = 2.58 [95%CI 2.15-3.09] for one or more hospitalizations) and of the private system (OR = 2.56 [95%CI 1.50-4.36] and OR = 2.22 [95%CI 1.64-3.00], respectively). The propensity to use basic health units was higher among users of the private system with functional limitations (OR = 2.01 [95%CI 1.12-3.59]). Only two out of seven indicators of the quality of medical care received were associated with functional limitation, in the perception of users of public and private systems. The public system users with functional limitations did worse evaluation of the freedom for choosing the doctor and waiting time for an appointment, when compared with users of the same system without these limitations (OR = 0.81 [95%CI 0.67-0.99] and OR = 0.76 [95%CI 0.62-0.93], respectively). Older adults with functional limitations use more health services in comparison with those without such limitations. The magnitude of the association between functional limitation and number of doctor visits and hospitalizations was similar in the public and private health systems.
