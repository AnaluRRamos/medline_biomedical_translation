Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is paramount in the assessment of knee pathology, particularly when planning for a surgical procedure. This study compared the diagnostic accuracy in MRI reading of pathological knees by radiologists and orthopaedic surgeons. Cross-sectional study comprising 80 randomly selected patients previously submitted to arthroscopic surgery after clinical examination and MRI. A diagnosis by MRI interpretation was requested from the two teams, one of radiologists and another of orthopaedic surgeons. The conclusions of each team were later compared. Statistical significance was considered for <i>p</i> < 0.05. The radiologists' findings achieved statistical significance regarding osteochondral injuries, ACL, and medial meniscus (<i>p</i> < 0.05), and orthopaedic surgeons regarding ACL injuries and menisci (<i>p</i> < 0.05). ACL injuries demonstrated a statistically significant association between teams (<i>p</i> < 0.001). MRI appears to offer reliable readings of ACL injuries, regardless the specialty of the observer. The lateral compartment is scarcely well read.
