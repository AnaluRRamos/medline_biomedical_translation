Glucocorticoids and melatonin (MEL) show integrated and complex immunomodulatory effects, mostly described for endotherms, yet underexplored in amphibians. In this context, the RT-qPCR of molecules mediating inflammatory processes in amphibians is a valuable tool to explore the relationships among molecular biology, endocrine mediators, and immune response in these animals. In this study, toads (<i>Rhinella diptycha</i>) received an intraperitoneal saline injection or lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 2 mg/kg). Six hours post-injection, we analyzed plasma corticosterone (CORT) and MEL levels and pro- and anti-inflammatory molecules (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-γ, and C1s). We found increased CORT and decreased MEL levels in response to LPS. Also, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10 were upregulated in LPS-injected toads compared with saline-injected toads. Overall, our results demonstrate an LPS-induced inflammatory response with endocrine and immune modulation in <i>R. diptycha</i> toads, exhibiting expected patterns for an inflammatory stimulus within this time frame (6 h post-injection). Toads were responsive to LPS by secreting different cytokines, such as proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-6, related to immune cell attraction to inflammatory sites and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, which limits the rate of leukocyte infiltration, inflammation, and downregulates the expression of proinflammatory cytokines. Increased circulating CORT levels are probably associated with the activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-interrenal axis by the LPS and the endocrine actions of IL-6. Furthermore, decreased circulating MEL levels are likely due to inhibited MEL secretion by the pineal gland by inflammatory stimuli, indicating the activation/existence of the immune-pineal axis in amphibians.
