Treatment of AIDS involves the use of the cocktail of drugs that make up the antiretroviral therapy. Its logistic control is monitored by a computerized national system of dispensation, the Logistic Control System of Medication (SICLOM). This study aimed to investigate, by means of SICLOM data, the use of antiretroviral therapy in patients treated at two University Hospitals in the state of Rio de Janeiro. A cross-sectional study was conducted with sociodemographic and dispensation data collected from SICLOM. The evaluation of drug ownership was done by calculating the Proportion of Days Covered (PDC). Five hundred and thirty-eight patients of both genders with active registration in SICLOM and over 18 years of age were included. The ART most used in both hospitals was lamivudine, considering the total of 58 different schemes identified. The mean of possession of groups was 88% (Â± 0,16). The factor associated with possession of drugs was the ART scheme, with PDC of 91% (p<0,001) for rescue schemes. This study confirmed that SICLOM was a reliable source to establish the profile of the population assisted.
