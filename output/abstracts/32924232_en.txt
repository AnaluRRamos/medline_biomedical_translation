The ComPath project is a pan-European programme dedicated to the monitoring of antimicrobial susceptibility of canine and feline pathogens using standardized methods and centralized minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination. To report antimicrobial susceptibilities of major pathogens isolated from nontreated animals with acute clinical signs of skin, wound or ear infections in 2013-2014. MICs were determined by agar dilution for commonly used drugs and interpreted using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) breakpoints, if available. Of 1,676 isolates recovered, the main species isolated from dogs were Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, followed by Streptococcus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. In cats, Pasteurella multocida, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) and Staphylococcus aureus were isolated most frequently. Resistance rates observed for S. pseudintermedius were <26.7% for penicillin, clindamycin and chloramphenicol, and ≤11.5% for ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefalexin, cefovecin, gentamicin and fluoroquinolones. For S. aureus, resistance rates ranged up to 90.9% for β-lactams, and were 19.7% for clindamycin, 27% for fluoroquinolones and 0.0-6.1% for other drugs. The mecA gene was confirmed by PCR in 10.6% of S. pseudintermedius, 11.6% of CoNS and 31.4% of S. aureus isolates. In streptococci/enterococci, resistance to penicillin, ampicillin and chloramphenicol ranged from 0.0% to 11.3%, whereas fluoroquinolone resistance ranged from 0.0% to 8.5%. For E. coli, resistance ranged from 13.8 to 15.9% for fluoroquinolones and from 86.2% to 100.0% for β-lactams. Low rates of resistance (0.0-6.3%) were observed in P. multocida, and for P. aeruginosa resistance to gentamicin was 10.3%. Overall, antimicrobial resistance of cutaneous/otic pathogens isolated from dogs and cats was low (1-10%) to moderate (10-20%). For several pathogens, the paucity of CLSI recommended breakpoints for veterinary use is a bottleneck.
