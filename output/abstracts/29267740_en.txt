To analyze HIV prevalence and associated factors in inmates in a prison in a state in the Northeast region of Brazil. Epidemiological, cross-sectional study carried out with prisoners. Interviews were conducted using a form and a rapid test for the diagnosis. Bivariate and multivariate hypothesis testing, with a simple logistic ratio (unadjusted odds ratio) and multiple ratio (adjusted odds ratio) were applied. Significance level was set at pâ‰¤0.05. A total of 2,131 inmates participated in the study. The HIV prevalence was 1.0%. Seropositive individuals were mostly Afro-American; their marital status was predominantly single/separated/widower. The mean age was of 31.3 years, and the mean educational level was 6.29 years. There was a link between the HIV virus and the variables: selection of partners based on physical attributes and vaginal sexual intercourse. Tackling the HIV infection represents a major challenge for prison and sanitary authorities, considering that the issues related to the HIV context inside and outside the prison environment are interconnected and, therefore, demands coordinated action.
