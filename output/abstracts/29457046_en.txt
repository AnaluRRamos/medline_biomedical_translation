Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a syndrome characterized by an acute deterioration of a patient with cirrhosis, frequently associated with multi-organ failure and a high short-term mortality rate. We present a retrospective study that aims to characterize the presentation, evolution, and outcome of patients diagnosed with ACLF at our center over the last 3 years, with a comparative analysis between the group of patients that had ACLF precipitated by infectious insults of bacterial origin and the group of those with ACLF triggered by a nonbacterial infectious insult; the incidence of acute kidney injury and its impact on the prognosis of ACLF was also analyzed. Twenty-nine patients were enrolled, the majority of them being male (89.6%), and the mean age was 53 years. Fourteen patients (48.3%) developed ACLF due to a bacterial infectious event, and 9 of them died (64.2%, overall mortality rate 31%); however, no statistical significance was found (<i>p</i> < 0.7). Of the remaining 15 patients (51.7%) with noninfectious triggers, 11 died (73.3%, overall mortality rate 37.9%); again there was no statistical significance (<i>p</i> < 0.7). Twenty-four patients (83%) developed acute kidney injury (overall mortality rate 65.5%; <i>p</i> < 0.022) at the 28-day and 90-day follow-up. Twelve patients had acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy (41.37%; overall mortality rate 37.9%; <i>p</i> < 0.043). Hepatic transplant was performed in 3 patients, with a 100% survival at the 28-day and 90-day follow-up (<i>p</i> < 0.023). Higher grades of ACLF were associated with increased mortality (<i>p</i> < 0.02; overall mortality 69%). ACLF is a heterogeneous syndrome with a variety of precipitant factors and different grades of extrahepatic involvement. Most cases will have some degree of renal dysfunction, with an increased risk of mortality. Hepatic transplant is an efficient form of therapy for this syndrome.
