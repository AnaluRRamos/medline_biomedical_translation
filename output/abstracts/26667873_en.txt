Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, of unknown etiology, is characterized by sudden and transient systolic dysfunction of the mid-apical segments of the left ventricle without significant coronary disease, and full normalization of segmental changes. More common in middle-aged women, it is cause of differential diagnosis with acute coronary syndrome. We present the case of a 59 year old woman admitted to the emergency room with sudden chest pain and dyspnea. At presentation: acute hypotensive pulmonary edema requiring aminergic support and invasive ventilation. Blood tests showed elevated necrosis myocardial enzymes. Serial electrocardiograms: sinus rhythm with progressive inversion of the T wave through the precordial leads (v2 - v6). Control echocardiograms: overall decreased systolic function with apical akinesia, and full reversal of the changes in 2 weeks. Cardiogenic shock of unknown etiology was admitted and a coronary computed tomography angiography was performed excluding coronary heart disease, supporting the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
