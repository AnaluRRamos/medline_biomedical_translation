To verify repercussions of submaximal exercise testing on respiratory mechanics and pulmonary function in schoolchildren. Cross-sectional study, with children aged 7 to 14 years, who had their respiratory mechanics assessed by impulse oscillometry (IOS), and pulmonary function by spirometry. They performed the six-minute walk test (6MWT), as per the standards by the American Thoracic Society. The 6MWT was performed twice with a 30-minute interval. IOS and spirometry were performed before the first 6MWT (Pre-6MWT) and immediately after the first (Post-6MWT1) and second walking tests (Post-6MWT2). The results in these three phases were compared by analysis of variance for repeated measures (post-hoc Bonferroni test) or by the Friedman's test, with p≤0.05 considered significant. Twenty-one subjects participated in the study: 53% were males and mean age was 10.9±2.3 years. There were differences between total resistance (R5) and central airway resistance (R20) at the three phases of assessment (p=0.025 and p=0.041, respectively). Post-hoc analysis indicated increase in R5 when Pre-6MWT and Post-6MWT1 were compared (R5=0.540±0.100 versus 0.590±0.150 kPa/L/s, p=0.013; and R20=0.440±0.800 versus 0.470±0.100 kPa/L/s, p=0.038). Forced expiratory flow 25-75% (FEF25-75%) changed over time (p=0.003). Repercussions were: increase in central and total airway resistance and reduction of FEF25-75% after 6MWT in schoolchildren, suggesting that greater attention should be given to submaximal tests in children with predisposition to airways alterations.
