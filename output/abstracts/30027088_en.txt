Avulsion of the tibial tubercle is an uncommon injury that occurs in the young athlete, resulting from an eccentric contraction of the extensor mechanism with the leg fixed to the ground. Concomitant injuries to the patellar tendon are very rare, with few cases reported in the literature. The authors present a case of a 15-year-old basketball player who suffered an avulsion of the tibial tubercle associated with complete distal rupture of the patellar tendon while training. It was treated with open reduction of the tibial fragment and reconstruction of the patellar tendon with mini-anchors and cannulated screws, as well as hamstring autograft tendon reinforcement. The patient showed excellent results and returned to sports after 12 months of follow-up.
