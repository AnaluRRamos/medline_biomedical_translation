To evaluate, through biomechanical testing, the resistance to and energy required for the occurrence of proximal femoral fracture in synthetic bone after removal of a proximal femoral nail model (PFN), comparing the results obtained with a reinforcement technique using polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). Fifteen synthetic bones were used: five units for the control group (CG), five for the test group without reinforcement (TGNR), and five for the test group with reinforcement (TGR). The biomechanical analysis was performed simulating a fall on the trochanter using a servo-hydraulic machine. In the GC, the assay was performed with the PFN intact. In the TGNR and TGR groups, a model of PFN was introduced and the tests were performed in the TGNR, after simple removal of the synthesis material, and in the TGR, after removal of the same PFN model and filling of the cavity in the femoral neck with PMMA. All groups presented a basicervical fracture. The CG presented a mean of 1427.39 Newtons (N) of maximum load and 10.14 Joules (J) of energy for the occurrence of the fracture. The TGNR and TGR presented 892.14 N and 1477.80 N of maximum load, and 6.71 J and 11.99 J of energy, respectively. According to the Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA, there was a significant difference in the maximum load (<i>p</i> = 0.009) and energy (<i>p</i> = 0.007) between these groups. The simple removal of a PFN in synthetic bone showed a significant reduction of the maximum load and energy for the occurrence of fracture, which were re-established with a reinforcement technique using PMMA.
