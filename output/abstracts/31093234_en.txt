Describe the phenotypical and genotypical characteristics of <i>Neisseria meningitidis</i> isolates from cases of meningococcal disease in Paraguay between 1996 and 2015. Conventional microbiological methods and molecular techniques were used to study 114 isolates of N. meningitidis and 12 clinical samples without isolation (confirmed by polymerase chain reaction), provided by various sentinel centers and collaborating centers in Paraguay. The most affected age group was children under 1 year (19.0%), followed by 1-5-year-olds (17.5%). The highest percentage of strains was isolated in meningitis cases (81.7%) and serogroup B was found in 60.3% of cases. The most frequent phenotypes were B:4:p1.14 (16.0%), B:15:p1.5, C:nt:nst, and W:nt:p1.2 (10.5%), respectively. The prevalent clonal complexes were: ST-11/ET37 complex, 29.6% (8/27), predominantly serogroup W (6/8); ST-35 complex, 18.5% (5/27), in serogroup B (4/4); and ST-32/ET5 complex, 14.8% (4/16), in serogroup B (5/5). Meningococcal meningitis is relatively uncommon in Paraguay. Distribution analysis showed that serogroup B is the most common and that the number of cases of meningococcal disease caused by serogroups C and W increased in the last two years. The identified clonal complexes were correlated with those found in the Southern Cone region. Due to the high virulence of <i>N. meningitidis</i>, its surveillance should be a strategic priority of national and regional public health systems to prevent epidemic outbreaks and support public health decision-making.
