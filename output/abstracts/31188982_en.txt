Identify the occurrence of depressive symptoms in family caregivers of patients with heart failure and the correlation of other variables with depressive symptoms. The literature review was conducted in the Web of Science, Medline, LILACS and PubMed databases in March 2017. Papers published between 2004 and 2016, written in English, Spanish or Portuguese were included. The descriptors used were health, heart failure, depression, caregivers, and family. 26 papers were selected. 6% to 64% reported depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms were associated with patients' and caregivers' characteristics. In most cases, depressive symptoms were greater among family caregivers than in the general population and were mainly associated with care burden and quality of life. The studies report depressive symptoms in caregivers of patients with heart failure.
