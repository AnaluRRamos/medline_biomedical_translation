GRACE, TIMI and HEART scores have been previously validated to predict serious untoward events among patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome (Non-ST ACS). However, the ability of these scores to discriminate the angiographic complexity of coronary artery disease has not been clearly established. We sought to evaluate the correlation between clinical scores (TIMI, GRACE and HEART) and the anatomical complexity assessed by SYNTAX score, among non-ST ACS patients undergoing cinecoronariography. Transversal cohort encompassing patients with diagnosis of Non-ST ACS referred to invasive stratification in our single center, between July 2018 and February 2019. Association between the scores was established by the Pearson's linear correlation test while the accuracy of the clinical scores versus SYNTAX score was determined with the ROC curve. A total of 138 patients were enrolled. Median GRACE, TIMI and HEART scores were 97, 3 and 5, respectively, whereas the median SYNTAX was 8. There was a positive correlation between the SYNTAX and the HEART (ρ =0.29; p<0.01) and GRACE (ρ =0.18; p<0.01) scores, but the correlation with TIMI reached no statistical significance (ρ =0.15; p=0.08). The HEART score was also the one with the highest area under the curve to predict a SYNTAX ≥32 [HEART = 0.81 (IC95% 0.7-0.91). HEART> 4 presented 100% sensitivity, with 50% specificity; and GRACE> 139 showed 55% sensitivity and 97% specificity for high SYNTAX. The clinical scores presented a positive, although modest, association with the SYNTAX score. The combined use of HEART and GRACE offers good accuracy for detecting angiographic complexity.
