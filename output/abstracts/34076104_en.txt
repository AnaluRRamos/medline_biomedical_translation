This research aimed to analyze the dwellers' knowledge of the territories, Pecém Port and Industrial Compound (CIPP), the quality of life of the communities living in the vicinity of the enterprises, and the prevalence of hypertension and overweight. This is a home-based, epidemiological survey of four areas of the Family Health Strategy (ESF) in São Gonçalo do Amarante and one area of the ESF in Caucaia, Ceará, Brazil. The study was carried out between 10/2017 and 03/2018. Anthropometric and blood pressure measurements were performed, and sociodemographic data and knowledge about community, the CIPP, and quality of life were collected. A total of 69.8% of the 503 adults interviewed were female, and the mean age was 44 years. Parada was the area reporting the highest percentage of problems related to air particles (51.1%), the worst concept regarding the CIPP (40.1% bad), the highest percentage of worse quality of life (29, 1%), and greater desire to move to another place (31.5%). Pecém had the highest percentage of community problems related to violence, consumption of illicit drugs, and prostitution. We concluded that there are signs of impact on local populations' health and quality of life without more significant direct work/income benefits.
