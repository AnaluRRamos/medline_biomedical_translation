The analysis of health policy trajectories contributes to disclose the endogenous and exogenous elements that influence the management of health systems. This article aims to describe the trajectory of the Unified Health System of the Federal District (SUS-DF) from 1960 to 2018 and identify the challenges to expand the capacity for protection and health promotion of the population of the Federal District. A documentary analysis of plans, reports, and articles published from 1959 to 2018 and the collection of secondary data were carried out in databases of DATASUS and the Government of the Federal District. RESULTS The SUS-DF trajectory was delineated through care organization actions, health system management and health care personnel training and development. Health indicators such as infant mortality and life expectancy at birth have shown a positive development. There was an increase in health care servicesupply, with an increase in the number of beds, basic health units and professionals, although insufficient, given the population increase. CONCLUSION the actions indicate the growing complexity of health system management, with challenges related to the adaptation of the capacity to respond to the population'shealth needs and reveal internal potentials in the field of health training.
