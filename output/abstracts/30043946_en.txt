To analyze the conceptions of the nursing professionals working in Basic Health Units regarding the detection and prevention of violence against the elderly. Descriptive, exploratory, qualitative study. Performed in two BHUs in Mossor√≥/RN, using a semi-structured interview script, from March to August of 2013. Sample composed of four nurses and six nursing technicians. The content analysis, pre-analysis, material exploration, and treatment of results were performed. Four categories were identified: Strategies used to identify violence against the elderly; Types of violence against the elderly; Conduct used after finding a suspicion of violence; SUS and the problem of violence against the elderly. Many professionals recognize/distrust possible cases, however, they do not know how to proceed. The dimension of the problem requires that pragmatic interventions be performed in the clinical setting and in the social context. There is a need for continuing education for professionals and greater communication between the bodies responsible for reporting and embracement.
