This study aimed to develop a prototype of the GISSA Mother-Baby ChatBot Application (GCBMB), a conversational agent to promote child health and evaluate the experience of use and satisfaction with this technological solution. This is a two-stage cross-sectional research with a mixed methodology. The first stage develops the settings of dialogue and the GCBMB prototype. The second stage evaluates the experience of using the ChatBot through a structured questionnaire where statements are used to assess the respondent's level of agreement using the Likert Scale and analyzes the application's use path through its database. The sample consisted of 142 puerperae, with a mean age of 25.4 years, where 38.1% were primiparous. The level of agreement of women with simplicity, good quality of information, clarity of content, usefulness, and satisfaction with the application was above 90%. Women between 26 and 30 years of age had a higher mean number of hits (5.21), settings accessed (9.26), and usage time (272 seconds) comparing younger and older women. The use of ChatBots on smartphones is encouraging to promote the health of children in Brazil. However, more investments are required to improve technological solutions and research with robust methodologies to evaluate their effectiveness.
