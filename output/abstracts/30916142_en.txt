To determine the predictive power of body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), and their respective cut-off points for high blood pressure (BP) screening in Brazilian children and adolescents. Cross-sectional study conducted with 1,139 students aged 6 to 17years. Body weight, height, WC, and BP were measured. High BP was classified as systolic or diastolic â‰¥ 95th percentile. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed, and the area under the curve, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated. The prevalence of high BP was 27.0%. Anthropometric indices showed a significant association with high BP (accuracy ranging from 0.62 - 0.81), except for WHtR among male adolescents.Sensitivity was low, regardless of the anthropometric index, gender, and age group. BMI, WC, and WHtR were associated with high BP, but the cut-off points tested showed low sensitivity. Determining specific cut-off points for each population can enable the use of anthropometric indices in high BP screening.
