To identify the workloads of nursing teams working in the Family Health Strategy in the five regions of Brazil and their interfaces with their feelings of exhaustion. Qualitative study with nursing professionals from 20 Family Health Units, from eight cities in the five regions of the country. Data were collected through interviews, observation and analyzed according to the precepts of thematic analysis and the theoretical framework of workloads. A total of 79 professionals participated in the study. Workloads were related to structural and managerial problems. Workloads that stood out were psychological workload, due to excessive demands and staff shortages; physiological workload, due to the overload of activities that generate physical pain and exhaustion; physical and mechanical workload, due to inadequacies in the work environment and equipment; biological workload, due to the presence of microorganisms; and chemical workload, due to exposure to dust and smoke. The sources that increase workloads are similar in the five regions, indicating that there is a strong influence of psychological and physiological loads on exhaustion among workers. However, workloads are reduced by dividing and planning team actions and by the affinity with the assistance model.
