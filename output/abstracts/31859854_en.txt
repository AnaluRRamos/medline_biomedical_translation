The training of nurses in Brazil remain a challenge for the university, given the existing ethnic diversity and regional particularities. Thus, the aim of this study was to identify the challenges in the training process of indigenous nurses in Mato Grosso, Brazil. It is an exploratory and qualitative study, carried out with 11 indigenous nurses. Data analysis was based on Paulo Freire's interculturality. It was verified that both participants sought the integration of indigenous traditional knowledge with scientific technical knowledge during their practices, which facilitates a satisfactory interaction with the community. During nursing undergraduate school, they had little or no contact with contents related to indigenous health and at the end of the training they observed they were not prepared to meet the diverse health demands. Historically, they are subordinated in relation to non-indigenous people, which manifests as disadvantages in the teaching-learning process, related to technical / technological as well as social aspects.
