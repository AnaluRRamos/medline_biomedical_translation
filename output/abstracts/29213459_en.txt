The Clock Drawing Test (CDT) is a brief cognitive screening tool for dementia. Several different presentation formats and scoring methods for the CDT are available in the literature. In this study we aimed to compare performance on the free-drawn and 'incomplete-copy' versions of the CDT using the same short scoring method in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and dementia patients, and healthy elderly participants. 90 participants (controlled for age, sex and education) subdivided into control group (n=20), MCI group (n=30) and dementia group (n=40) (Alzheimer's disease - AD=20; Vascular Dementia - VD=20) were recruited for this study. The participants performed the two CDT versions at different times and a blinded neuropsychologist scored the CDTs using the same scoring system. The scores on the free-drawn version were significantly lower than the incomplete-copy version for all groups. The dementia group had significantly lower scores on the incomplete-copy version of the CDT than the control group. MCI patients did not differ significantly from the dementia or control groups. Performance on the free-drawn copy differed significantly among all groups. The free-drawn CDT version is more cognitively demanding and sensitive for detecting mild/early cognitive impairment. Further evaluation of the diagnostic value (accuracy) of the free-drawn CDT in Brazilian MCI patients is needed.
