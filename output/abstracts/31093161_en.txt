Describe users' experience with participation in clinical decision-making at Family Health Centers (CESFAM) in the Primary Health Care (PHC) system. Qualitative descriptive study. Focus groups made up of CESFAM users were held in southeastern Santiago, Chile, and the information was thematically analyzed using Atlas.ti version 6<sup>Â®</sup> software. Five focus groups were held (n = 41). The main themes that emerged from the discussions were the passive role of users in decisions and delegated decision-making, based on their trust in the health professional. Users' passive role limits their opportunities for participation in clinical decision-making, ceding power to the health professional. However, establishing a therapeutic partnership allows users to feel that they are being treated as unique individuals whom the professional listens to and respects, ensuring that the decisions of the health team can be trusted, since they look out for the users' real interests. Users' participation in clinical encounters is still limited in Chile. However, bolstering that participation is essential for increasing user satisfaction and promoting people-centered care.
