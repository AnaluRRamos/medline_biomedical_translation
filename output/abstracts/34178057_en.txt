Severe palmoplantar hyperhidrosis affects about 1.5-2.8% of the general population. Plantar hyperhidrosis (PHH) is related to foot odor, cold feet, skin lesions and infections, and even instability when walking. Endoscopic Lumbar Sympathectomy (ELS) is the treatment of choice for this condition. However, few surgeons have used this technique over the past 20 years because of its technical difficulty. Two and 3 mm instruments, rather than the standard 5 mm instruments, have been used to improve the results of several standard laparoscopic procedures. Use of these minilaparoscopic instruments to perform ELS so far has not yet been published. We describe a technique for ELS using minilaparocopic instruments, which we have used for our last 70 cases and has become our standard technique. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of this technique and its advantages compared to the conventional technique.
