To more accurately determine coverage and timeliness of the second dose of measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR2), while identifying factors associated with low MMR2 vaccination uptake among children in Saint Lucia. A survey was conducted in October - November 2015 targeting children born in 2004 - 2009. At 86 preschools and primary schools, two children from each grade were randomly selected, yielding an effective sample of 836 children. Health records were reviewed to assess vaccination coverage and timeliness. Parents and/or guardians and principals of all 86 schools were interviewed regarding knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to vaccination. Of 767 children included, 75% were vaccinated with MMR2 (n = 572); 46.7% were vaccinated in a timely manner, i.e., by 5 years of age. Cohorts born in 2004, 2005, and 2008 reported the lowest proportion. 'Mothers as caregivers' was positively associated with timely MMR2 vaccination. Although 97% of principals surveyed considered vaccination important, 48.8% were not aware of national legislation requiring complete vaccination prior to school entry. Survey results concurred with the low MMR2 administrative coverage rates reported by Saint Lucia, much lower than the recommended 95%. Based on the results of this survey, Saint Lucia's national immunization program has lowered the age of MMR2 to 18 months in 2016, increased advocacy with schools to enforce the school-entry law, and is working to vaccinate the cohorts of children who have not received timely MMR2.
