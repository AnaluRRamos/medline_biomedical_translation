To verify the association between laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) with age, gender, vocal deviation and voice complaints. The study included patients between 18 and 70 years old, referred to the Otorhinolaryngology service for complaints of voice or reflux, of both sexes. Endolaryngeal findings were classified using the Reflux Finding Score (RFS) scale. The presence or absence of vocal and reflux complaints was verified and correlated with the RFS classification. On the same date, they were submitted to sustained vowel voice recording and chained speech. The auditory-perceptual assessment was performed by a speech therapist, classifying the general degree of vocal deviation based on the GRBASI scale. Ninety-seven patients were evaluated, with a mean age of 42. 6 years, 62. 3% female, and mean RFS scores of 6. 26 points. Among the patients, 48 subjects had vocal complaints, 34 women with a mean age of 44. 9 years and an average RFS score of 6. 94 points. The other 49 individuals had no vocal complaints, and of these 27 were women, with a mean age of 41. 2 years and a mean RFS score of 5. 5 points. The variables 'reflux complaint', 'vocal complaint' and age were the ones that most correlated with the RFS scale scores. There is a relationship among reflux complaints, laryngeal findings and vocal complaint.
