To understand, from the ethical perspective of Freire's, the nursing care for people with borderline personality disorder. This is a qualitative research whose production of information was conducted from May to June 2016 in two psychiatric admission units. We have interviewed seven nurses and eight nursing technicians. The information was analyzed in the light of Paulo Freire's referential framework. The following categories have come up: 1) Welcoming and therapeutic relationship as instruments to strengthen linkage; and 2) Drug therapy and restraint: interface between protection, establishment of limits and other challenges for care'. Nursing care involved technologies related, medicine administration and physical restraint. There were difficulties in dealing with this disorder. The way to care for nursing, although still permeated by some prejudices, runs through ideologies contained in the ethical assumptions that operate in the light of Freire's work.
