This paper opens a discussion on the main features of an investment case for obesity prevention and control, by scanning available evidence on existing approaches and by highlighting contextual considerations and evidence for Latin America and the Caribbean. We call on researchers and analysts in the field to update and broaden existing methods of economic analyses to better reflect the multisectoral nature of an investment case for obesity prevention and control. We also identify research gaps and further work required to advance methods and evidence towards investment cases throughout the Americas.
