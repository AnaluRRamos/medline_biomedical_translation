Several markers have been evaluated for a potential impact on clinical decisions or mortality prediction in acute coronary syndrome (ACS), including Netrin-1 and IL-1β that have been associated with cardiovascular disease. Our study examined the prognostic value of Netrin-1 and IL-1β in patients with ACS (2-year follow-up). We evaluate Netrin-1, IL-1β and other risk factors in the serum sample of 803 patients. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression were used for the analysis of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and a combined outcome of fatal myocardial infarction (MI) or new non-fatal MI, considering p-value < 0.05. There were 115 deaths from all causes, 78 deaths due to cardiovascular causes and 67 events in combined outcomes. Netrin-1 levels above the median (>44.8 pg/mL) were associated with a worse prognosis (all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality) in elderly females, even after model adjustment (HR: 2.08, p = 0.038 and HR: 2.68, p = 0.036). IL-1β levels above the median (>13.4 pg/mL) in elderly females were associated with increased risk of all outcomes after adjustment (all-cause mortality - HR: 2.03, p = 0.031; cardiovascular mortality - HR: 3.01, p = 0.013; fatal MI or new non-fatal MI - HR: 3.05, p = 0.029). For males, no associations were observed between Netrin-1 or IL-1β and outcomes. High serum levels of Netrin-1 and IL-1β showed significant association with worse prognosis in elderly females. They may be useful as prognostic indicators in ACS. (Arq Bras Cardiol. 2020; 114(3):507-514)
