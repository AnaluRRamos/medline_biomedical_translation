This study aimed to identify whether the development of hearing abilities in the first year of life is related to the development of language in preterm neonates with chronological age between 18 and 36 months, verifying if the language performance varies according to the weight/gestational age ratio. Retrospective and longitudinal study approved by the Institution's Ethics Committee. The sample consisted of 66 preterm infants of both sexes, aged 18-36 months, divided into two groups: AIG Group 39 neonates with weight appropriate to the gestational age, 26 with normal hearing and 13 with altered hearing; and PIG group 27 neonates small for gestational age, 18 with normal and 9 with altered hearing. Results from the development of auditory skills in the first year of life and evaluation of the reception, expression and total of language (Menezes, 2003) were obtained from neonatal follow-up records. We used the ANOVA and the Equality Test of Two Proportions as statistical procedures. In each group, we observed a significant difference in the Reception and Total language in children with normal and altered auditory development. Children with normal hearing development presented a higher percentage of language adequacy. The language performance did not differ in relation to the weight / gestational age adequacy. Changing auditory abilities in the first year of life interfered more in language development than the gestational age / weight ratio.
