The outpatient surgery program from our department has started in 2014 to improve patient access to surgery and to reduce the surgical waitlist. Focused on the thoracic surgery, the most common intervention is the surgical treatment of primary hyperhidrosis by thoracic sympathectomy by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). It is performed according to the patient's symptoms, with section or application of surgical clips between R2-R5. Retrospective study including all the patients submitted to thoracic sympathectomy by video- -assisted thoracoscopy surgery from our department's outpatient surgery program from January 2014 to January 2016. In our outpatient program we performed 198 thoracic sympathectomy by VATS. The mean age of the patients was 32,8 years old. 63,6% of the patients were females and 36.4% were males. From the 198 endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy performed, 181 (91,4%) were performed bilatellary with section between R3-R5, 12 (6,1%) were performed with the application of surgical clips in R2-R4 and 3 (1.5%) could not be performed due to the presence of pleuropulmonary adhesions. One of the patients was re-operated due to recurrent symptoms and another patients had surgery to remove the surgical clips (bilaterally in R2) due to exaggerated abdominal compensatory hyperhidrosis. Three patients had pneumothorax. The surgical treatment of primary hyperhidrosis was the most frequent procedure in our outpatient surgery program. The procedure without the use of a thoracic drainage allowed its inclusion in the outpatient surgery program. Excluding 3 patients, all the patients were discharged within 12 hours after the surgery. The good results and the reduction of the surgical waitlist encourage the cardiothoracic outpatient surgery program.
