Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed type of cancer and is the leading cause of death from cancer in the female population. Screening mammograms and early treatment are the most frequently used means to attempt to reduce this mortality and are promoted during Pink October, an annual awareness-raising campaign. However, recent studies have correlated the increase in screening with higher morbidity and mortality, due to overdiagnosis and overtreatment. The current study assessed searches related to breast cancer and mammogram in Google Trends from 2004 to 2019 in terms of trend, seasonality, and distribution in Brazilian states. The study also evaluatedH the correlation between the number of searches in Google Trends and the number of screening mammograms. The two series showed a seasonal pattern with peaks in October, and there was an excess in tests performed outside the recommended age bracket. Pink October transmitted and popularized health information and induced behaviors related to this information, which are three desirable aspects in health communication and education. However, the campaign also generated an excess in screening mammograms and did not encourage autonomy and free and informed consent. Pink October revealed both the potential of mass communication in health and the need for messages to be aligned with the best available scientific evidence.
