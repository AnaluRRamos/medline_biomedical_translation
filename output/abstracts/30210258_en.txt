The aim of the present study was to determine whether the side of application of the plate itself affects the mechanical stability of the fixation. The specific question addressed is whether or not a lateral or medial plate application is biomechanically better, for the treatment of distal diaphysis fractures of the femur. Stability and stiffness of medial sided plating relative to the conventional lateral sided plating in distal diaphysis of the femur were measured by analyzing axial loading forces leading to implant failure. Sixty synthetic femurs were tested in physiological bending, to calculate the yield and ultimate load to displacement following fixation of distal diaphysis fractures of the femur by either medial or lateral sided plating. Axial loading was applied to samples using a uniaxial testing machine. There was more implant deformation in the lateral sided plating group - a difference with statistical significance. Medial sided plating was found to be as stiff as lateral plating. Medial plating may be a reasonable treatment option that can be used safely in selected cases. <b><i>Level of Evidence I, Therapeutic Studies Investigating the Results of Treatment</i></b>.
