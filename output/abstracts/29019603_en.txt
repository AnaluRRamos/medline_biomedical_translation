Phenomena involving electromagnetism and conservation of energy during the nineteenth century did not fit the reigning Newtonian paradigm. Among scholars, there was the need to explain such facts considering 'something more' that had not yet been expressed. Through this explanation, Naturphilosophie, the philosophical branch associated with the German romantic movement of the nineteenth century, seems to offer new ways of understanding the sciences. In this article, we present main aspects of the work of Schelling, the main exponent of Naturphilosophie, and how his assumptions were inserted into the physical sciences to explain electromagnetism and conservation of energy.
