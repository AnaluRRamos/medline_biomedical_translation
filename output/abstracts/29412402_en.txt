A systematic review of nutritional and sociodemographic characteristics of nursing mothers, using the published literature from 2004 to 2014 in the Biblioteca Virtual de Sa√∫de and Medline databases. Using the following key words, 561 articles were identified: 'Human Milk' and 'Milk Banks'; keywords: 'Profile,' 'Nutritional,' 'Milk Donor,' 'Nursing Mother' and 'Nursing Mothers'; available abstracts; date and language. From these, 84.1% were excluded for not dealing with the established subject, 1.8% for being a review and 7.5% for the unavailability of abstracts for study. Thirty-seven articles were selected, of which 18.9% analyzed the profile of the HM donor. Of the total, 89.2% reported age, the majority between 20 and 30 years of age. The level of schooling was mentioned in 32.4% ranging from elementary school and higher education. With respect to income, a higher prevalence of low socioeconomic status was observed. About the nutritional status, 45.9% of the studies measured the body mass index and 29.4% reported the predominance of excess weight. There were deficiencies, particularly of vitamin A, with frequencies between 9% and 26%. A majority of young adult mothers, varied schooling, low income and nutritional deficiencies were noted, demanding interventions to improve health and increase HM donations.
