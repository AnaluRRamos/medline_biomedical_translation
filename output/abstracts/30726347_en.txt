The Health, Wellbeing and Aging Study (SABE) began in 2000 under the coordination of the Pan American Health Organization as a multicenter study developed in seven urban centers of Latin America and the Caribbean, to determine the health and living conditions of elderly in this region. In Brazil, the study was developed in the city of SÃ£o Paulo, where 2,143 individuals (cohort A) aged 60 years or older were selected through probabilistic sampling. In 2006, 1,115 of these individuals were interviewed a second time, and a new probabilistic cohort of individuals aged 60 to 64 years was added (cohort B; n=298). Thus the SABE Study - Brazil was transformed into a multi-cohort longitudinal study, with the objective of identifying changes that occur in the aging process among different generations. In 2010, a longitudinal follow-up was developed with cohorts A and B, with the addition of a new cohort of individuals aged 60 to 64 years (cohort C; n=355). Thethree surveys (2000, 2006 and 2010) involved the application of a questionnaire, anthropometric evaluation and functional tests, with the subsequent inclusion of blood collection for the evaluation of biochemical, immunological and genetic variables, as well as an accelerometer for the measuring of caloric expenditure.
