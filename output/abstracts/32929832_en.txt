The humoral immune system of reptiles is not well-studied. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this case report describes the first case of a type I allergic conjunctivitis associated with orchard grass in an African spur-thighed tortoise (Centrochelys sulcata) supported by intradermal allergen testing and provocative testing. Further studies are needed to better characterize allergic reactions in reptiles.
