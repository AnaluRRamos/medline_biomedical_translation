This scoping review aims to describe and characterize the Brazilian pharmacovigilance system Brazil (SINAF) and verify to what extent it meets the minimum requirements proposed by the World Health Organization for the functional performance of this type of national system. The literature search strategy used STARLITE recommendations and search terms in MEDLINE/PubMed, Google, the Brazilian National Press, and the website of the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (Anvisa), from 1999, when Anvisa was created, to March 2016. The review included 47 publications (4.4%), out of a total of 1,068 identified, in the following order: 14 legal provisions (29.8%), 13 (27.6%) technical documents, and 10 (21.3%) scientific articles. The studies and technical documents covered the creation of the first pharmacovigilance technical unit at the federal level, the reporting system for adverse events, the National Monitoring Center, and the Technical Chambers on Medications. The reporting rate for adverse drug events in Brazil in 2013 was 36 reports per million inhabitants, considerably lower than the target proposed in the international literature, which suggests 300 reports per million inhabitants. This study identified structural and functional aspects that can compromise the performance of SINAF, such as lack of legislation officially establishing the system itself and its objectives.
