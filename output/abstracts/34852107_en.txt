This study aimed to assess the prevalence of dyslipidemia and its association with an adequate intake of carbohydrates, saturated, monounsaturated, trans, and omega-3 fats among adults living in Vi√ßosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil. This is a cross-sectional study with 884 adults aged 20 to 59 years. Sociodemographic, food intake, anthropometric, and biochemical data were collected. Associations between study variables were investigated by the chi-square test. There was a high prevalence of dyslipidemia in the study population (64.25%), with most individuals having abnormal levels of at least one serum lipid component. Inadequate intakes of saturated, trans, and monounsaturated fats and carbohydrates were predominant. It is noteworthy that omega-3 intake levels were adequate in most individuals. Eutrophic adults showed a higher prevalence of excessive intake of saturated and trans fats. It was found that 38.7% of individuals with low levels of High Density Lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) had an excessive intake of saturated fat. Most individuals with high triglyceride levels or high triglyceride/HDL-c ratios had an insufficient intake of monounsaturated fat. Further studies are needed to evaluate other factors that may influence dietary patterns.
