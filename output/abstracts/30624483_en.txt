An initial analysis is made of the way obstetricians that defend the humanization of childbirth in Brazil understand and analyze the practice of episiotomy, a conventional technique included in protocols in obstetrics that they had learned in medical training and subsequently abandoned. We present an initial analytical construct through the prism of the social studies of science and technology and raise questions about the neutrality of science and technology and the impartiality of the specialist/scientist. We further point out the relationships that seem to exist between political activity, the production of scientific knowledge, and technical activities in the professional work of the aforementioned obstetricians.
