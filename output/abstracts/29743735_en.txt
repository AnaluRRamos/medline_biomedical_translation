To evaluate suspicious amorphous calcifications diagnosed on full-field digital mammography (FFDM) and establish correlations with histopathology findings. This was a retrospective study of 78 suspicious amorphous calcifications (all classified as BI-RADS<sup>Â®</sup> 4) detected on FFDM. Vacuum-assisted breast biopsy (VABB) was performed. The histopathological classification of VABB core samples was as follows: pB2 (benign); pB3 (uncertain malignant potential); pB4 (suspicion of malignancy); and pB5 (malignant). Treatment was recommended for pB5 lesions. To rule out malignancy, surgical excision was recommended for pB3 and pB4 lesions. Patients not submitted to surgery were followed for at least 6 months. Among the 78 amorphous calcifications evaluated, the histopathological analysis indicated that 8 (10.3%) were malignant/suspicious (6 classified as pB5 and 2 classified as pB4) and 36 (46.2%) were benign (classified as pB2). The remaining 34 lesions (43.6%) were classified as pB3: 33.3% were precursor lesions (atypical ductal hyperplasia, lobular neoplasia, or flat epithelial atypia) and 10.3% were high-risk lesions. For the pB3 lesions, the underestimation rate was zero. The diagnosis of precursor lesions (excluding atypical ductal hyperplasia, which can be pB4 depending on the severity and extent of the lesion) should not necessarily be considered indicative of underestimation of malignancy. Suspicious amorphous calcifications correlated more often with precursor lesions than with malignant lesions, at a ratio of 3:1.
