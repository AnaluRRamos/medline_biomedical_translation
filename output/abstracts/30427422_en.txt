Sexual and reproductive health rights were developed recently as a result from the movements held for Human Rights and citizenship. Delimitations of this subject have not been explored in Brazil yet, even though the importance of developing skills related to this subject is recognized. This paper aims to construct a Sexual and Reproductive health transversal skills framework based on specialists' point of view. A mix methods descriptive exploratory research with the use of the Delphi Technique was developed with 41 specialists in sexual and reproductive health and rights. Three rounds of data gathering were carried out. Of the 36 skills resulting from the qualitative analysis, 32 achieved a general consent and were classified in four domains: ethics and professional principles; leadership and management; community work, health and education, counseling and evaluation; and health care. Results corroborate skills content recommended by the international literature. These skills, which are transversal, may support the development of actions and practices of the health professionals concerning sexual and reproductive health care.
