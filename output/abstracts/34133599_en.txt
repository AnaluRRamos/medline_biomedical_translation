Orange juice (OJ) is rich in polyphenols with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. After myocardial infarction (MI), complex changes occur in cardiac structure and function, which is known as cardiac remodeling (CR). Oxidative stress and inflammation can modulate this process. We hypothesized that the consumption of OJ attenuates the CR after MI. To evaluate the influence of OJ on CR after MI by analysis of functional, morphological, oxidative stress, inflammation, and energy metabolism variables. A total of 242 male rats weighing 200-250 g were submitted to a surgical procedure (coronary artery ligation or simulated surgery). Seven days after surgery, survivors were assigned to one of the four groups 1) SM, sham animals with water and maltodextrin (n= 20); 2) SOJ, sham animals with OJ (n= 20); 3) IM, infarcted animals with water and maltodextrin (n= 40); and 4) IOJ, infarcted animals with OJ (n = 40). Statistical analysis was performed by the two-way ANOVA supplemented by Holm-Sidak. Results are presented as mean Â± standard deviation, the level of significance adopted was 5%. After 3 months, MI led to left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, with systolic and diastolic dysfunction, and increased oxidative stress and inflammatory mediators. OJ intake reduced LV cavity and improved systolic and diastolic function. The OJ animals presented lower activity of glutathione peroxidase and higher expression of heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1). OJ attenuated CR in infarcted rats and HO-1 may be play an important role in this process.
