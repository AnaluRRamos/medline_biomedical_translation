The article sought to describe awareness of public physical activity programs, practice of physical activity in public programs and barriers related to non-participation in these programs in a national representative sample according to sex, age, skin color, income, state and having been visited by a family health team (EqSF, in Portuguese) in the previous year. This is a cross-sectional survey with data from the Brazilian National Health Survey, 2013. We carried out descriptive analyses using the distribution of relative frequencies and their respective 95% confidence intervals, weighted in the sample design. We included 60,202 individuals. We found a 20% prevalence of awareness and, of these, 9.7% reported practicing physical activity in public programs. Most commonly reported barriers were lack of time (41.4%) and lack of interest in available activities (29.7%). Women have greater awareness when compared with men, but levels of physical activity were similar in both sexes. Awareness and physical activity were higher in the older age groups. Awareness increased with income, but the poorest participate more in public physical activity programs when compared with the other income categories. Awareness and physical activity were similar among those who were and were not visited by EqSF. Prevalences of awareness and participation in public physical activity programs are not expressive, with nearly 30% of individuals disinterested in current programs. Local-regional efforts are needed so that physical activity can be established as a health promotion tool.
