To compare clinical characteristics of tinnitus and interference in quality of life in individuals with and without associated hearing loss, as well as to discuss the association of quantitative measurements and qualitative instruments. A quantitative, cross-sectional and comparative study approved by the Research Ethics Committee (No. 973.314/CAEE: 41634815.3.0000.0106) was carried out. The responses of the psychoacoustic assessment of tinnitus (intensity, frequency, minimum masking level and loudness discomfort level for pure tone and speech), as well as the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) questionnaire, and the visual analogue scale (VAS) were compared between 15 patients with tinnitus and peripheral hearing loss (group I) and 16 adults with normal hearing (group II). The mean VAS and THI scores obtained in GI were 5.1 (+1.5) and 42.3 (+18), and in GII, 5.7 (+2.6) and 32.7 (+25), respectively. This result suggests moderate GI annoyance and moderate/mild GII annoyance (p>0.005). There was a positive and moderate correlation between THI and VAS only in GII. In the psychoacoustic evaluation, significant differences were observed between the groups regarding the measurement of loudness (*p=0.013) and the minimum masking level (*p=0.001). There was no direct influence of the presence of hearing loss in relation to the impact of tinnitus. The differences found between the groups regarding the psychoacoustics measures can be justified by the presence of cochlear damage. The objective measurement of tinnitus, regardless of the presence or absence of peripheral hearing loss, is an important instrument to be used along with self-evaluation measures.
