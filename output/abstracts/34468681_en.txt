The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of excess weight and associated factors in women of reproductive age living in a low-income community. A cross-sectional study was conducted with a sample of 663 women 15 to 49 years of age residing in the neighborhood of Coelhos in the city of Recife, Brazil. Body mass index (BMI)-for-age was used to classify the nutritional status of the adolescents (15 to 19 years of age), adopting Z-score of ≥+1 for the definition of overweight. For the adults, BMI≥25.0 kg/m² was considered indicative of overweight. Socioeconomic, demographic and reproductive variables were analyzed as possible factors associated with overweight. The prevalence of excess weight was found in two thirds of the sample. The results of the Poisson multiple regression analysis showed a significantly higher prevalence of excess weight with the advance in age, among those with a younger menarche age, those who had three or more pregnancies, those living with their partner and those self-declared black or white. Multiparity was the only factor associated with excess weight that could be modified, which underscores the importance of prenatal and family planning services to its prevention and control.
