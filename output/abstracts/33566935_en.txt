There is conflicting information about whether lung ultrasound assessed by B-lines has prognostic value in patients with heart failure (HF). To evaluate the prognostic value of lung ultrasound assessed by B-lines in HF patients. Four databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Scopus) were systematically searched to identify relevant articles. We pooled the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) from eligible studies and carried out heterogeneity, quality assessment, and publication bias analyses. Data were pooled using a fixed-effects or random-effect model. A p value < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. Nine studies involving 1,212 participants were included in the systematic review. B-lines > 15 and > 30 at discharge were significantly associated with increased risk of combined outcomes of all-cause mortality or HF hospitalization (HR, 3.37, 95% CI, 1.52-7.47; p = 0.003; HR, 4.01, 95% CI, 2.29-7.01; p < 0.001, respectively). A B-line > 30 cutoff at discharge was significantly associated with increased risk of HF hospitalization (HR, 9.01, 95% CI, 2.80-28.93; p < 0.001). Moreover, a B-line > 3 cutoff significantly increased the risk for combined outcomes of all-cause mortality or HF hospitalization in HF outpatients (HR, 3.21, 95% CI, 2.09-4.93; I2 = 10%; p < 0.00001). B-lines could predict all-cause mortality and HF hospitalizations in patients with HF. Further large randomized controlled trials are needed to explore whether dealing with B-lines would improve the prognosis in clinical settings.
