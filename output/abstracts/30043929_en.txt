To describe the construction process of an intervention in the form of a Nursing Care program to Adolescents aimed at preventing and controlling overweight/obesity in the school environment. A methodological study developed through Intervention Mapping in Natal/RN, Brazil, between October of 2015 and September of 2016, with the participation of adolescents, public school teachers and nurses in Primary Health Care. Data sources were focus groups, interviews and an integrative review. The Collective Subject Discourse was used for analysis. At the end of the six stages of the Intervention Mapping, the 'School Health Nursing Program' (Programa de Enfermagem Sa√∫de na Escola) was constructed, which should be implemented over 10 months with five weekly classes of exercises and a weekly session of nursing interventions detailed in the Program. The nursing intervention guided by Intervention Mapping allows actions based on theories, community participation, school/service bonds, and care continuity.
