The aim of the present study was to evaluate the consumption of ultra-processed (UP) foods and associated factors among adults. We used cross-sectional data on 947 adults from the 2008-2009 Campinas Health Survey. Food consumption data were collected using the 24-h dietary recall method and food items were classified according to NOVA classification based on the nature, extent and purpose of industrial processing. Linear regression models were run to evaluate the association between the consumption UP foods and predictor variables with a 5% significance level. The average daily energy intake per capita was 2000.6 kcal and UP foods represented 24.1% of this intake. UP food consumption was higher among women and increased with the increase in schooling. Consumption was also higher among young adults between 20 and 29 years old as well as ex-smokers and individuals who were physically active at leisure. The results show that there is still time to intervene in favor of the health of the adult population. Thus, studies dedicated to the investigation of food intake from the perspective of the NOVA classification, the possible repercussions for health and the evaluation of food and nutrition actions and policies should be prioritized in the current context of Brazil.
