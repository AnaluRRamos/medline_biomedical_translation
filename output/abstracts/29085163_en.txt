To compare the predictions of dominant Gleason pattern â‰¥ 4 or non-organ confined disease with Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS v2) with or without proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (<sup>1</sup>H-MRSI). Thirty-nine men underwent 3-tesla endorectal multiparametric MRI including <sup>1</sup>H-MRSI and prostatectomy. Two radiologists assigned PI-RADS v2 and <sup>1</sup>H-MRSI scores to index lesions. Statistical analyses used logistic regressions, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and 2x2 tables for diagnostic accuracies. The sensitivity and specificity of <sup>1</sup>H-MRSI and PI-RADS v2 for high-grade prostate cancer (PCa) were 85.7% (57.1%) and 92.9% (100%), and 56% (68.0%) and 24.0% (24.0%). The sensitivity and specificity of <sup>1</sup>H-MRSI and PI-RADS v2 for extra-prostatic extension (EPE) were 64.0% (40%) and 20.0% (48%), and 50.0% (57.1%) and 71.4% (64.3%). The area under the ROC curves (AUC) for prediction of high-grade prostate cancer were 0.65 and 0.61 for PI-RADS v2 and 0.72 and 0.70 when combined with <sup>1</sup>H-MRSI (readers 1 and 2, <i>p</i> = 0.04 and 0.21). For prediction of EPE the AUC were 0.54 and 0.60 for PI-RADS v2 and 0.55 and 0.61 when combined with <sup>1</sup>H-MRSI (<i>p</i> > 0.05). <sup>1</sup>H-MRSI might improve the discrimination of high-grade prostate cancer when combined to PI-RADS v2, particularly for PI-RADS v2 score 4 lesions, but it does not affect the prediction of EPE.
