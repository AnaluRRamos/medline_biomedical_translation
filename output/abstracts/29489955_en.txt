Characterize the profile of aphasic syndromes determined by aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) of the left middle cerebral artery (LMCA). An analytical, retrospective, cross-sectional study was conducted using a database of cognitive assessments of 193 patients with aSAH admitted to Hospital da Restauração between March 2007 and November 2009. Of these, a total of 26 patients with aSAH in the LMCA territory confirmed by digital angiography were selected. Aphasia was assessed through the Montreal-Toulouse Language Assessment Alpha Version Protocol (Alpha Version) and the CERAD Neuropsychological Test Battery (Verbal fluency). Language and verbal fluency impairments were identified in patients with aSAH in the LMCA territory when compared with the control population (50 individuals). Of the 26 patients with aSAH, 11 presented aphasic characteristics preoperatively. The results of this research corroborate the literature, showing that the aSAH frame causes cognitive impairments even in the preoperative phase for aneurysm occlusion. Considering the observed aspects, the predominant aphasic syndromes characterize comprehension aphasia due to sequels in the posterior cerebral artery territory.
