The objective of this study was to determine the frequency and anatomical characteristics of Struthers' ligament and the supracondylar humeral process and evaluate the clinical implications in compressive neuropathy of the median nerve . We dissected 60 arms from 30 cadavers (26 males and 4 females): 15 were previously preserved in formalin and glycerin and 15 were dissected fresh in the Anatomy Laboratory for this paper. The relationships between Struthers' ligament and the median nerve and brachial artery and veins were documented with drawings and photos . The supracondylar humeral process was not found in any of the 60 dissected arms. Struthers' ligament was identified in six arms (two bilateral); in all cases high insertion of the pronator teres muscle was observed . Struthers' ligament is an aponeurotic structure that may or may not be associated with the supracondylar humeral process, and is an important potential site of median nerve compression in the lower third of the arm. Level of Evidence IV, Case Series.
