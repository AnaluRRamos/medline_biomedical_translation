Strain elastography (SE) is a modern imaging technology that provides an additional way of evaluating the changes in soft tissue elasticity caused by pathophysiological processes. Despite its widespread use in human medicine, only a few studies on the application of SE in veterinary medicine are available. To evaluate the potential usefulness of SE as an integrative imaging model in the standard ultrasound technique to better discriminate between inflammatory and neoplastic skin nodules in dogs. Fifty-one client-owned dogs with clinical evidence of single or multiple skin nodules detected during routine dermatological examination. Margins, echogenicity, echo-structure, calcification and vascularisation of 65 skin nodules were assessed with ultrasound, and SE was used to score qualitative (E-score, E-index, E2) and semiquantitative (SR) parameters. A comparison of diagnostic yields with cytological and histological findings as the gold standard was performed. Mast cell and benign follicular tumours showed the highest E-scores and SRs among neoplastic nodules; statistically significant differences were not detected. Calcific and nonvascularised nodules showed significantly higher E-index values than the others. Overall, a negative correlation was observed between the longitudinal diameter of skin nodules and the qualitative elastic parameters. In this study, SE proved to be useful to identify only a subset of nodules such as mast cells and hair follicular tumours. Although evidence supporting the use of SE in evaluating skin nodules was demonstrated to below, indicators to guide further research were developed.
