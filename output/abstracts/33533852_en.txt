Aimed at strengthening breastfeeding policies, human milk banks (HMBs) play an important role in promoting, protecting and supporting this practice. The objective of this study was to undertake a systematic review to identify activities developed by HMBs that demonstrate their role in promoting maternal and infant health. Searches for relevant articles were performed in the following databases: PubMed, Virtual Health Library (BVS), and BVS Breastfeeding linked to the portal of the Brazilian Human Milk Bank Network. Eleven articles were included in the final sample. The main topics covered by the articles were: the characteristics of breast milk donors; the importance of information provided by HMB professionals on maintaining breastfeeding for hospitalized premature infants; weight gain in premature babies fed on donated milk; HMB breastfeeding support actions; and factors influencing human milk donation. The actions developed by HMBs have a positive impact on the promotion of maternal and infant health, representing an important strategy for promoting breastfeeding and supporting the feeding of babies who are not able to feed directly at the breast.
