This research aimed to analyze the National Committee for the Implementation of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (CONICQ). The study covered the period from 2003 to 2015 and built on the referential analysis of public policies, considering structure and political process and Committee's agenda and performing capacity. Methodological strategies were documentary analysis, including Committee's minutes of meetings, direct observation of events and interviews with key stakeholders. The regular functioning and gradual expansion of the Committee was observed in the period, permeated by technical and political aspects that influence its structuring and the establishment of the agenda. Conflicts have been identified among CONICQ members and between these and external stakeholders, especially from the clashing opinions on economic and health-related viewpoints. Its capacity for action was limited by internal (from some government agencies) and external (from organizations linked to the tobacco industry and tobacco growers) resistance. CONICQ is a strategic instance to the Brazilian tobacco control policy. However, its activity as an intersectoral coordination mechanism is complex, given the different interests, stances and levels of engagement of agencies involved in tobacco control.
