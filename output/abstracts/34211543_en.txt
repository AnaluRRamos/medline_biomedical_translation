This narrative review covers the life-threatening thromboembolic events associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19. It addresses the physical changes that cause vascular and arterial damage to limbs, laboratory management of coagulation, and management of anticoagulation. COVID-19's relationship with deep venous thrombosis and arterial thrombosis is also emphasized. The main thromboembolic events described in the literature are illustrated with examples from our experience with COVID-19 patients.
