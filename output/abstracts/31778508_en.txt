In this interview, Marco Am√©rico Lucchesi, Tenured Professor of Comparative Literature at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), visiting professor of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz), and member and president of the Brazilian Academy of Letters, outlines his perception of the current crisis and the impact on the consolidation of Brazilian democracy. Based on his experiences as a critic and intellectual, he comments on the attacks on culture and the production of knowledge that we have witnessed in Brazil. He reminds us that no democracy is a fully-fledged ontological reality and highlights the role of schools and universities in mobilizing citizenship and spreading republican values. He highlights some achievements that are expressed by the presence of Indians and African Brazilians in universities. Acknowledging the call for help inherent in every crisis, he calls upon us to revive the dream and courage and advocates the suspension of distinctions in favor of forming a front of democracy and solidarity. These are analyses and convocations that are based, at all times, on a firm confidence in the power and capacity of resilience of culture.
