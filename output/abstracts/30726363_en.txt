The prevalence of sleep problems in elderly, such as insomnia, is a relevant issue in our society. Poor sleep quality is viewed by many as an inevitable result of aging. In this context, this study aimed to estimate the prevalence and associated factors of sleeping disturbances in elderly men and women (60 years and older). The present study is part of SABE Study (Health, Well-being and Aging), a cohort conducted in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. The sample included in the present cross-sectional study comprised 1,334 elderly people aged 60 years or older. Sleep disturbances were assessed based on responses of study participants on whether they had experienced any sleep disturbance in the past month. Among the elderly assessed, 44.9% had overall sleep disturbances, which were more frequent in women (51.5%) and in 75 to 79 years old (48.2%). According to the regression analysis, the variables gender, joint diseases, as well as nocturia and urinary incontinence, were associated with sleep disorders. Increase in sleep disturbances was found not to be linearly age-dependent. Gender, pain, urinary and nocturia incontinence were factors associated with sleep disorders. Thus, we might conclude that the absence of sleep disturbances in older adults depends on gender and health status.
