Health self-assessment (HSA) is a widely studied indicator among adults and the elderly, but not often explored in adolescents. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of poor self-rated health in Brazilian schoolchildren and associated factors. Data from the 2015 National Adolescent School-based Health Survey (PeNSE) were analyzed; prevalences and their 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were estimated for poor self-rated health and associated factors. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed. A total of 7.1% (95%CI 7.0 - 7.3) of the schoolchildren reported a poor self-assessed health status. Sociodemographic characteristics, such as female gender, 15 years of age or older, yellow, brown and indigenous race/skin color; risk behaviors such as regular alcohol consumption and drug experimentation, and issues related to physical and emotional health remained positively associated with the outcome studied. Protective factors identified were maternal schooling and demand for health services. The impact of risky behaviors on physical and emotional health need to be addressed among students. The school presents itself as a safe and opportune space for promoting a healthy lifestyle.
