Determine the spatial distribution of hospital discharges of viral fever caused by mosquito bites in Mexico and characterize its historical trend in the period 2004-2014. An exploratory cross-sectional inferential analysis was performed. The primary data were obtained from the hospital discharge registries of the National Health Information System (SINAIS) for the period 2004-2014. In order to identify clusters of reported cases, indicators of geographical association were estimated and risk areas established on the basis of environmental determinants validated with estimated relative concentration measurements. In order to determine the temporal trend and age structure of the cases, growth rates were estimated and density curves constructed. The geographic distribution of these hospital discharges in Mexico follows a focalized pattern. In total, a high concentration was detected in clusters made up of 20 municipalities, 9 of which were located in the state of Sinaloa. In 37% of states in the country, the concentrations of hospital discharges of viral fever cases were higher than those for the country as a whole, and their localization indices ranged from 5.79 in Sinaloa to 1.17 in Campeche. Geographic information, information on the link found between areas at high risk for transmission of infection due to the presence of the transmitting vector, and information on social conditions such as poverty are useful for designing strategies for the prevention and control of emerging arthropod-borne viral infections, such as the Zika virus, in Mexico.
