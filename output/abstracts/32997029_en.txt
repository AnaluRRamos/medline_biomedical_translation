This study aims to analyze the index of decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMFT) at age 12 in the Midwest Region and to identify associated factors, according to the National Oral Health Survey 'SB Brasil 2010'. This is a cross-sectional population-based study from the SB Brasil 2010 database, conducted in the capitals of Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Goiás, Federal District and a sample of municipalities in the region. Data were analyzed by the chi-square test and prevalence ratios with their respective confidence intervals, at a significance level of 5%. The Poisson regression was used in the multiple analysis to study the association between the outcome variable and the explanatory variables. The independent variables that were associated with the DMFT were: the state of residence in Mato Grosso, Goiás and Mato Grosso do Sul; the per capita income ≤ R$500.00; difficulties eating and sleeping, and reason for the visit was Pain/Extraction/Treatment/Other. Mean DMFT was 2.14 and the prevalence of dental caries affected 41% of adolescents.
