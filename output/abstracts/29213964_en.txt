Culture is a dynamic system of bidirectional influences among individuals and their environment, including psychological and biological processes, which facilitate adaptation and social interaction. One of the main challenges in clinical neuropsychology involves cognitive, behavioral and functional assessment of people with different sociocultural backgrounds. In this review essay, examining culture from a historical perspective to ethical issues in cross-cultural research, including the latest significant and publications, the authors sought to explore the main features related to cultural variables in neuropsychological practice and to debate the challenges found regarding the operational methods currently in use. Literature findings suggest a more comprehensive approach in cognitive and behavioral neuroscience, including an interface between elementary disciplines and applied neuropsychology. Thus, as a basis for discussion on this issue, the authors analyzed key-topics related to the study of new trends in sociocultural neuroscience and the application of their concepts from a clinical perspective.
