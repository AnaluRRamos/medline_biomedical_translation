This ecological study aimed to analyze the trend of the nutritional status of pregnant adolescent beneficiaries of the Brazilian Bolsa Família conditional cash transfer program in the 2008-2018 period. We evaluated secondary data of pregnant adolescent beneficiaries of the Bolsa Família Program from January 2008 to December 2018, extracted from the public reports of the WEB Food and Nutrition Surveillance System. We accessed the monitoring reports on the consolidated public-access health conditionalities of the Bolsa Família Program, always considering the second validity. An annual variation of -1.2% (95%CI: [-1.6; -0.8] p<0.01) was observed in the prevalence of underweight in Brazil in the studied sample. The prevalence of overweight and obesity in the country had annual variations of 2.9% (95%CI: [2.0; 3.7] p<0.01) and 7.5% (95%CI: [5.7; 9.3] p<0.01), respectively. We conclude by saying, that, in the evaluated period, the prevalence of underweight among pregnant adolescent beneficiaries of the Bolsa Família Program showed a decreasing trend, while the prevalence of overweight and obesity increased throughout Brazil.
