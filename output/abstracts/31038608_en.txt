To identify what risks and incidents related to the drug therapy process are presented in an Emergency Care Unit (UPA) and to present proposals for management actions and safe practices, in the perception of the nursing team. Qualitative research, in the research-action modality, developed in the scenario of UPA, located in the interior of SÃ£o Paulo. Data collection was done through interviews and focus groups with 33 professionals, between June 2015 and April 2016. For the data treatment, the Content Analysis Technique was used. From the participants' reports, thematic categories were organized, with the risks and incidents related to the drug therapy process being one of the listed categories, as well as proposals for actions. The study allowed the implementation of patient safety actions related to the administration of drugs in a PAU, offering a higher quality of care.
