The scope of the study was to evaluate patient safety culture and associated factors in Brazilian hospitals with different types of management, namely federal, state and private hospitals. The design was cross-sectional and observational. A survey of 1576 professionals at three hospitals of Rio Grande do Norte state was performed using the Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture adapted for Brazil, which measures 12 dimensions of safety culture. Perceptions are described by attributing a general result (Range 0-10) and the percentage of positive responses to estimate their strengths and weaknesses. The response rate was 13.6% (n= 215). The patient safety coefficient was between 7 and 10 for 78.1% of the respondents, whereby the highest average grade was attributed to the private hospital (8.32). It has been estimated that the type of hospital management, unit service, position and number of adverse event notifications are associated with the overall patient safety grade (p <0.001). Only the private hospital had strengths in the dimensions analyzed, while the weaknesses appeared in all the hospitals.
