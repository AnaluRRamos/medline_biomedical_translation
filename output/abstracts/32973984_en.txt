Given the sociodemographic diversity in Brazil, it is fundamental to understand the speech performance of a sample from the Brazilian capital. The repetition task can assess phonological and motor-phonetic planning. Previous studies found phonological-phonetic performance of speakers to be associated with education, age, and other demographic factors. To compare the phonetic-phonological performance for speech of younger and aged adults in the capital of Brazil, Federal District (FD); to compare FD performance against national normative means based on São Paulo; to determine the association of phonetic-phonological agility with sociodemographic, cognitive, and neuropsychiatric variables for the sample. Cross-sectional study. A total of 60 volunteers from the FD, comprising 30 older adults and 30 younger ones, were stratified by education into two subgroups: 2‒7 years and ≥8 years of education. Data on age, educational level, and socioeconomic status were collected. The Verbal Agility subtest of the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination was applied to assess phonetic-phonological performance. No statistically significant difference in performance for verbal agility was found between aged and younger adults from the FD. There was a statistically significant difference in the phonetic-phonological performance of the FD sample compared with the Brazilian normative mean values. Cognitive and socioeconomic variables were associated with verbal agility. In the capital of Brazil, economic status, age, education, and cognitive variables were associated with verbal agility performance, despite there being no difference in phonetic-phonological performance between younger and aged adult groups. Regional differences in phonetic-phonological performance were also evident.
