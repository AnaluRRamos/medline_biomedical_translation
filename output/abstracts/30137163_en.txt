To investigate the prevalence of back pain and associated factors in children attending public schools from South Brazil. A cross-sectional study, conducted between May-July 2014, where a random sample of 619 adolescents, aged 10-17 years of age, was evaluated. The prevalence of back pain was assessed using the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire, and the independent variables (demographic and biological information, the way of transporting school supplies, and pain during and after the walk) were obtained through a standardized questionnaire. The Poisson regression model was used to estimate unadjusted and adjusted prevalence of back pain in association with the factors investigated. The prevalence of back pain was 45.2 %, out of which 64.6 % reported pain in one region, 27.1 % in two and 8.3 % in the three regions investigated. After an individual assessment of regions, it was found that the highest prevalence of pain relates to the dorsal region (26.2 %). The most relevant associated factors include female gender (OR=1.43, 95 %CI 1.19-1.74; p<0.01), age between 14 and 17 (OR=1.22; 95 %CI = 1.03-1.45; p=0.02), and dark skin (OR=1.20, 95 %CI 1.01-1.43; p=0.04). The results highlight the need for greater attention to adolescents complaining of back pain, in order to prevent the presence of this chronical disorder in adolescence and later in adulthood. Therefore, it is necessary to educate adolescents and their guardians for the stimulation and consequent adoption of healthy practices for musculoskeletal integrity.
