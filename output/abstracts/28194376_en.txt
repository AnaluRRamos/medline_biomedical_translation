One-year mortality rate was 23.6%. Mortality was higher among women, with a 3:1 ratio. Anemia (<i>p</i> = 0.000) and dementia (<i>p</i> = 0.041) were significantly associated with the death group. Patients who remained hospitalized for less than 15 days and who were discharged within seven days after surgery showed increased survival. In the present sample of patients with hip fracture who underwent surgery, one-year mortality rate was 23.6%, and the main comorbidities associated with this outcome were anemia and dementia.
