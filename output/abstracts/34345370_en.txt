An amputation is an irreversible event that causes social, psychological, and functional consequences that reduces the quality of life of the amputee. Phantom pain generally is reported by 50 to 80% of amputees. To describe the pain and phantom sensation and quality of life among lower-limb amputees. This was a cross-sectional study carried out in the region of Juiz de Fora, state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Inclusion criteria were being a patient in one of two hospitals in the region at the time of the interview and having at least one lower-limb amputation. A total of 20 amputees were included in the analysis. The interview questionnaire had items adapted from the Groningen Questionnaire Problems After Leg Amputation - describing the frequency and discomfort of phantom pain and sensation, causes and the level of the amputation, as well as the WHOQOL-BREF, for assessing quality of life. Most participants were women (55%) and had a mean age of 55.6 years (SD=14.8). Femoral amputation was the most prevalent (65%), and diabetes (40%) was the main reason for amputation. 29% of amputees classified the phantom pain as moderate or severe, and 15% claimed daily frequency of this phenomenon. As for phantom pain, only 6% stated daily frequency. The mean quality of life was 4.1 (SD=1.1, five score means very satisfied), the physical domain of quality of life had the lowest mean (3.4, SD=0.7). Phantom sensation and pain were prevalent among lower-limb amputees who were, in general, less satisfied with their physical domain of quality of life.
