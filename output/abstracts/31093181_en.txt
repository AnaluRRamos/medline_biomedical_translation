To review the empirical consequences of the use of geoprocessing in the management of primary health care (PHC) services, in order to disseminate the benefits of this technology and analyze the challenges that must be overcome for its contribution to the development of PHC. A systematic review of primary studies published in Spanish, English or Portuguese between 2000 and 2017 was carried out. First, a review of the academic production was carried out by continent and type of objective. In a second stage, the studies that experimented with and evaluated the use of geoprocessing in empirical form were selected. Specific and generic benefits, as well as limitations, were reviewed. 134 articles were identified in the first stage of selection, half of them from the Region of the Americas. Only nine studies met the criteria and were reviewed in the second stage. These studies showed that the use of geoprocessing generates benefits that go beyond the technical benefits, with limitations that can be overcome. Although the benefits of using geoprocessing have been widely discussed, few studies have evaluated its implementation in PHC empirically. Practical experiences, which could easily be reproduced in different communities, show that its continued use could increase the capacity to respond to the goals of PHC, as well as to the goals of sustainable development.
