The scope of this study was to evaluate the influence of contextual and individual factors associated with dissatisfaction of users of the Unified Health System (SUS) with the care provided by dentists in Primary Health Care. It is a cross-sectional and multilevel study, based on secondary data derived from a national basic research project to assess user satisfaction with the SUS. Data were collected by the Ombudsman's Department of the SUS by telephone contact with a sample of 35,393 individuals from around the country. Contextual and individual variables were associated with dissatisfaction with the dental service provided by the SUS. For the analysis, Stata version 11.0 software was used together with multilevel random effects logistic regression. A total of 2,331 individuals from 61 municipalities were included in the final sample of satisfaction with the dental service. Only 43% of the participants reported that their claims had been resolved, and a seven times greater chance of dissatisfaction was perceived for those individuals who had unresolved demand in relation to those who resolved it. This research provides input that can subsidize the government in actions aimed at improving access and quality of care provided in dental care.
