Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome is a rare cerebrovascular disorder characterized by cerebral arterial segmental vasoconstriction, usually spontaneously reversible. This disease can occur in the postpartum period, manifesting itself through acute neurologic symptoms, and the imaging studies play a fundamental role in its diagnosis. Although classically considered a benign and self-limiting disease, it may present less favorable courses with significant associated morbidity and mortality. We describe a case of reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome in the puerperium, with progressive cerebral vasospasm causing ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. We intend to make an alert to the potential complications of this entity that demand intense clinical and imaging surveillance.
