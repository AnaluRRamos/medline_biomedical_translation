to analyze association between sociodemographic factors and cardiovascular health risk behaviors of Brazilian adolescents aged 13-17 years. we used data on 10,926 adolescents from the 2015 National School-Based Health Survey (PeNSE) to verify associations between socio-demographic variables and consumption of unhealthy foods, insufficient physical activity, and experimentation with alcoholic beverages and cigarettes, using Poisson regression. associations were found between consumption of candies, insufficient physical activity and experimentation with alcoholic beverages and the female sex ([PRa=1.37 - 95%CI 1.25;1.50], [PRa=1.32 - 95%CI 1.26;1.38] and [PRa=1.05 - 95%CI 1.00;1.10]); soda consumption with the male sex (PRa=1.17 - 95%CI 1.03;1.31) and higher maternal schooling (PRa=1.14 - 95%CI 1.01;1.31); cigarette experimentation with the male sex (PRa=1.12 - 95%CI 1.00;1.25), being 16-17 years old (PRa=1.51 - 95%CI 1.33;1.72), not living with father (PRa=1.36 - 95%CI 1.20;1.53) or mother (PRa=1.25 - 95%CI 1.13;1.37). cardiovascular health risk behaviors influenced by sociodemographic characteristics should be taken into consideration in Brazilian adolescent health promotion.
