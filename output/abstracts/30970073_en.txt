The Drinking Water Quality Surveillance Information System (SISAGUA) is an instrument used in Brazil to record forms of water supply and water quality monitoring data recommended by the potable water standard. This information is used in the management of health risks associated with water supply in the country and supports the surveillance of drinking water quality, the structuring of public policies in the area of environmental health and sanitation, the prevention of waterborne diseases, and the characterization of the quality of water consumed by the Brazilian population. This article describes the history of SISAGUA and presents the main features of its current version (SISAGUA 4) regarding data collection and processing, variables, uses and accesses, data coverage and quality, as well as the system's applicability, limitations and challenges.
