This article depicts the teaching of sociology in nineteenth-century Brazil, using sources such as the Di√°rio Oficial do Estado do Amazonas and the Amazonas newspaper published between 1890 and 1900 that convey experiences in the state of Amazonas. The theoretical-methodological approach focuses on document analysis and Bourdieu's concept of 'field' in order to understand the dynamics of how sociology was situated within normal schools and secondary education in Brazil. The results illustrate teacher training, the number of students, the content and its inclusion in the curriculum, the influence of federal laws, and international circulation of ideas in the teaching of sociology.
