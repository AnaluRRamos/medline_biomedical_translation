To evaluate the influence of elbow and forearm range of motion on the distal excursion of the long head of the biceps (LHB). The distal excursion of the LHB after tenotomy of the shoulders of eight cadavers was ascertained by measuring the distance between a point marked out on the LHB, 3 cm from the anterolateral border of the acromion, and its position at different degrees of elbow flexion, using a digital pachymeter. The measurements at elbow flexion of 135°, 90°, 45° and 0° were noted: these angles were established using a goniometer. The measurements were made with the forearm in neutral, supination and pronation positions. Differences between the mean measurements of the distal excursion of the LHB (total sample) were observed between the degrees of elbow flexion (p < 0.01). However, no statistical differences were observed between the different forearm positions, between the sides, genders and ages of the cadavers studied. Progressive extension of the elbow caused progressive distal excursion of the LHB, but without interference in the forearm position, gender, side or age of the cadavers studied.
