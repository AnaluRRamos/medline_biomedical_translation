Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are rare tumors derived from the neuroendocrine cell system, and more commonly found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Over the last decades, the incidence of GI-NETs has been steadily increasing, partly due to the expanding indications for endoscopy. Most patients with NETs are asymptomatic, and their NETs are noticed during screening examinations; thus, endoscopists are on the frontline of the diagnosis of GI-NETs. Since GI-NETs are less frequent than other malignancies, the natural history, diagnosis, and management of these tumors may not be fully understood. In this review, we aim to update the endoscopist on key clinical features and management of patients with gastric, duodenal, and rectal NETs.
