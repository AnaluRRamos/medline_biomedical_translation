In 2005, a pharmaceutical care service was created in the State of Cear√° to provide pharmacotherapeutic follow-up for individuals infected with Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas Disease). After 10 years of operation, an evaluation was conducted to assess the degree of satisfaction of patients treated under the service. This prospective study used a questionnaire comprising the following sections: socioeconomic data; infrastructure, facilities and operations; pharmaceutical care; and importance of the service. Seventy patients of both sexes and over 18 years of age were interviewed between August 2014 and May 2015. As for infrastructure, location and operation, the average grades show a high level of patient satisfaction. Regarding pharmaceutical care, most patients reported being satisfied and considered 'being well treated' to be the most important aspect during treatment. In addition, all patients (100%) rated the service as very important and would recommend it to other individuals. Overall, the study showed a high level of patient satisfaction with the service. There is, however, still much to work to be done on this service in order to promote greater access and qualified care to fully achieve a humanized model focused on patient needs.
