Despite the increasing use of noninvasive methods for the assessment of liver fibrosis and steatosis, the effect of fasting and food intake on these parameters is not yet clear. Our aims were to evaluate the effect of food intake on liver stiffness (LS) (measured by transient elastography) and controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) in patients with different degrees of liver disease and healthy volunteers, and secondarily, to assess possible factors associated with variations of LS and CAP. We performed a prospective single-center study including patients with liver disease and healthy volunteers. LS and CAP were evaluated using FibroScan® (Echosens, Paris, France), before (fasting ≥8 h) and 30 min after intake of a standardized breakfast. We used common cutoffs for LS: > 7 kPa for significant fibrosis (F2 to F4) and > 11 to 14 kPa (mean 12.5 kPa) for cirrhosis. Fifty-nine (72%) patients with liver disease and 22 (28%) healthy volunteers were included. LS significantly increased 30 min after food intake (pre-meal 6.1 kPa [IQR: 4.7-9.8] vs. after-meal 6.8 kPa [IQR: 5.5-10.6]; <i>p</i> < 0.001). This difference was only significant in patients with chronic liver disease (<i>p</i> = 0.02) and not in healthy volunteers (<i>p</i> = 0.106). CAP values did not increase significantly after food intake. Gender, body mass index, mass of body fat, lean body mass, and percent of body fat were not related with significant variations of LS and CAP values after meal intake. Significant variations of LS were observed after ingestion of a standard meal, which may have consequences for patient management. CAP values were not significantly affected by food intake. Therefore, we consider that before the isolated evaluation of CAP, it is not necessary to perform any fasting period.
