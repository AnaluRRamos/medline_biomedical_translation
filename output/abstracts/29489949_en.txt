The aim of this study was to explain the association between social-environmental factors and major land uses and the occurrence of cases of American tegumentary leishmaniasis (ATL) in the spatial circuits of production in Minas Gerais State, Brazil. This was an analytical-type ecological study based on secondary data on ATL divided by three-year period from 2007 to 2011, in which the analytical units were municipalities belonging to the spatial circuits. Two distinct stages were performed. The first was the elaboration of thematic maps with identification of the circuits. In the second, a new indicator, ATL cases by population density, was associated with social-environmental indicators and major land uses, submitted to multivariate principal components analysis (PCA). During the periods studied, three circuits were identified, distributed in the major regions of Northern Minas Gerais, Rio Doce Valley, and Greater Metropolitan Belo Horizonte. There was a strong association between ATL by population density and temporary crops, natural pasture, natural forest, unusable lands, and rural population, and a weak association with planted pasture. The association of cases with the major land uses variable in different agricultural profiles shows the occupational nature of ATL, associated mainly with rural workers. The association of the disease with environmental variables and deficient basic sanitation also proved relevant in the transmission profile in spatial circuits of production in Minas Gerais.
