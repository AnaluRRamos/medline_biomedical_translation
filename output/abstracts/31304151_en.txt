The objective of this study is to evaluate the results and effectiveness of the technique of meniscal repair type all-inside using Fast-Fix device. A retrospective cohort study evaluating 22 patients with meniscal surgery between January 2004 and December 2010 underwent meniscal repair technique for all-inside with the Fast-Fix device with or without ACL reconstruction. Function and quality of life outcomes were chosen by the IKDC and Lysholm score, before and postoperatively, and reoperation rates, relying to the time of final follow-up. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student's <i>t</i> test. The mean follow-up was 59 months (16-84). The Lysholm score showed 72% (16 patients) of excellent and good results (84-100 points), 27% (6 patients) fair (65-83 points) and no cases classified as poor (<64 points). According to the IKDC: 81% (18 patients) of excellent and good results (75-100 points), 18% of cases regular (50-75 points) and no patient had poor results (<50 points). There were no failures or complications. The technique of meniscal repair type all-inside using the Fast-Fix device is safe and effective for the treatment of meniscal lesions in the red zone or red-white with or without simultaneous ACL reconstruction, with good and excellent results in most patients Level 4 Study.
