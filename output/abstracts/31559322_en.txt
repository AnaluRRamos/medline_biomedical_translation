Narrow-band imaging (NBI) allows 'in vivo' classification of colorectal polyps. We evaluated the optical diagnosis by nonexpert community-based endoscopists in routine clinical practice, the impact of training, and whether the endoscopists could achieve the threshold for the 'do not resect' policy. This was an observational study performed in two periods (P1 and P2). Endoscopists had no prior experience in NBI in P1 and applied the technique on a daily basis for 1 year before participation in P2. Lesions were classified by applying the NBI International Colorectal Endoscopic (NICE) and Workgroup serrAted polypS and Polyposis (WASP) classifications, simultaneously. A total of 290 polyps were analyzed. The overall accuracy of optical diagnosis was 0.75 (95% CI 0.68-0.81) in P1, with an increase to 0.82 (95% CI 0.73-0.89) in P2 (<i>p</i> = 0.260). The accuracy of the NICE/WASP classifications to differentiate adenomatous from nonadenomatous histology was 0.78 (95% CI 0.72-0.84) in P1 and 0.86 (95% CI 0.77-0.92) in P2 (<i>p</i> = 0.164); assignments made with a high confidence level achieved statistical significance (13% improvement, 95% CI 3-22%; <i>p</i> = 0.022). The negative predictive value for adenomatous histology of diminutive rectosigmoid polyps was 81% (95% CI 64-93%) and 80% (95% CI 59-93%) in P1 and P2, respectively. Nonexpert endoscopists achieved moderate accuracy for real-time optical diagnosis of colorectal lesions with the NICE/WASP classifications. The overall performance of the endoscopists improved after sustained use of optical diagnosis, but did not achieve the standards for the implementation of the 'do not resect' strategy.
