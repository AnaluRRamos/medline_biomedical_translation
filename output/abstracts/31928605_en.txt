Granular cell tumors are uncommon, and are usually benign neoplasms that can mimic malignancy on breast imaging tests. These tumors can originate anywhere in the body and the breast accounts for only a few cases of all granular cell tumors. We report a case of a 54-year-old woman with a granular cell tumor of the breast presenting clinically on breast imaging (ultrasound, mammography and magnetic resonance) as a suspicious lesion. Core needle biopsy was performed for tissue diagnosis and was consistent with granular cell tumor that was confirmed in the histopathological report of the surgical specimen following a breast lumpectomy. Given the rarity of this tumor, we present this case to highlight this diagnostic hypothesis, that can be challenging and frequently confused with breast carcinoma.
