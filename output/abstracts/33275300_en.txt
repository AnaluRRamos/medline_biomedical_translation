A recent pilot study of primary care veterinarians' attitudes regarding canine atopic dermatitis and initiation of allergen-specific immunotherapy (ASIT) revealed several barriers to specialist referral (in the USA) and use of ASIT as a treatment modality. The primary objective was to collect data on referral habits and ASIT practices among a much larger cohort of primary care veterinarians located around the world, and to explore barriers to referral and management of atopic diseases of dogs and cats with ASIT. An online survey, administered through the Veterinary Information Network (VIN, Davis, CA, USA), asked participants to self-report their referral habits and immunotherapy recommendations, and rate barriers and motivating factors using Likert-scale responses. Of 827 survey responses, 97.6% identified as primary care practitioners. A larger number of practitioners (84.5%) reported seeing atopic dogs often, compared with atopic cats (9.7%). Fewer of these veterinarians (56.6%) referred atopic cats for specialist care, compared to atopic dogs (73.5%). Timely communication, sharing long-term management of the case, and provision of local continuing education were identified as factors associated with increased willingness to refer. A higher proportion of practitioners reported recommending ASIT for dogs (44.3%) than for cats (16.0%). Only 56.0% of respondents considered success rates of ASIT to be acceptable, while 27.9% were neutral on the topic. Dermatology specialists might build stronger relationships with referring veterinarians through timely case follow-up and provision of continuing education regarding the long-term benefits of ASIT and symptomatic management practices.
