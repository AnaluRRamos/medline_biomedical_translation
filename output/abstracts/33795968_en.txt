To describe the clinical and radiographic results of patients with traumatic recurrent anterior shoulder dislocation treated with the Bristow-Latarjet procedure. Retrospective case series including 44 patients (45 shoulders) who underwent the Bristow-Latarjet procedure. The graft was fixed 'standing' in 84% of the shoulders, and 'lying' in 16%. The follow-up was 19.25 ± 10.24 months. We obtained 96% of good results, with 2 recurrences presented as subluxation. Graft healing occurred in 62% of cases. The graft was positioned below the glenoid equator in 84% of the cases, and less than 10 mm from its edge in 98%. The external rotation had a limitation of 20.7º ± 15.9º, while the internal rotation was limited in 4.0º ± 9.6º. The limitation of rotation and the position of the graft ('standing' or 'lying') did not correlate with graft healing (p>0.05). Bicortical fixation was positively correlated with healing (p <0.001). The Bristow-Latarjet technique is indicated for the treatment of recurrent anterior dislocations and subluxations of the shoulder. It is a safe treatment method, which can be used in people with intense physical activity. Limiting shoulder mobility does not prevent patients from returning to their usual occupations. <i>Level of Evidence IV, Case series.</i>
