This paper reviews the Starfield pillars and the Canadian health system. An objective and subjective evaluation are applied to the system through the lenses of access, longitudinality, integrality, and coordination of care. System vulnerabilities, actions, and proposals that are underway to improve these aspects, both nationally and in the province of Ontario, are discussed. Worth highlighting is the opportunity to establish a national free drug system, and the several challenges to advance the agenda of reforms.
