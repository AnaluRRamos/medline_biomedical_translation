The variables associated with the model were: female, black, yellow, brown, mothers with no higher educational level, adolescent workers (OR 2.10 CI 95% 1.78-2.47). In the family context, they remained associated with aggression, lack of parents 'understanding' (OR 1.71 CI95% 1.63 -1.80) and their intrusion into adolescent's privacy (OR 1.80 CI95% 1.70 -1, 91). Report of missing school (OR1.43 CI95% 1.36-1.50). Among the behaviors: smoking (OR 1.23 CI95% 1.12-1.34), alcohol (OR 1.49 CI95% 1.41-1.57), drug experience (OR 1.24 CI95% 1, 15-1,33), early sexual intercourse (OR 1.40 CI95% 1.33 -1.48), reports of loneliness, insomnia and bullying (ORa 2.14 CI95% 2.00-2.30).
