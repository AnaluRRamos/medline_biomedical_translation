Torsion of the fatty appendage of the falciform ligament, part of the spectrum of conditions known as intra-abdominal focal fat infarction (IFFI), is very rare with less than 20 cases reported on imaging so far. Here we report a case of torsion of the lipomatous appendage of the falciform ligament in a middle-aged female, diagnosed on ultrasound and computed tomography (CT). CT showed classical 'hyperattenuating rim' sign in the anterior perihepatic space adjacent to the falciform ligament. We re-emphasize the importance of 'hyperattenuating rim' sign on CT in recognizing IFFI in locations other than the pericolic region.
