The purpose of this study was to evaluate aortic wall thickness after periodontal disease and/or obesity induction in a Wistar rat model.Sixty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups: control (CT), periodontal disease (PD), obesity (OB), and obesity plus periodontal disease (OB+PD). Groups OB and OB+PD received cafeteria diet for 17 weeks. After they had acquired obesity (week 12), periodontal disease was induced by placing a silk ligature on the maxillary right second molar of groups PD and OB+PD. During the experimental period, body weight and Lee index were assessed. Mean alveolar bone loss (ABL) was evaluated, and aortas were prepared for histometric analysis of the aortic wall by ImageJ software. Body weight and Lee index increased in rats exposed to cafeteria diet. Mean ABL was higher in Groups PD and OB+PD than in control and OB (p<0.05). ABL was 18% higher in Group OB+PD than in Group PD, with statistically significant difference (p<0.001). Aortas were thicker in Groups OB and OB+PD than in control and PD groups, respectively (2.31mm ± 0.28 and 2.33 ± 0.29 vs. 2.18 ± 0.26 and 2.14 ± 0.27). Group OB differed significantly from the control group (p=0.036), and OB+PD and OB differed significantly from PD (p=0.004 and p= 0.001, respectively). Obesity alters aortic wall thickness in Wistar rats. However, the presence of periodontal disease did not affect the aortic wall thickness under the conditions of the present study.
