The 'Quality of Recovery 15' questionnaire is used for the study of quality recovery after anesthesia. The aim of this study was to validate the Portuguese version of 'Quality of Recovery 15' questionnaire. After study approval by the institutional ethics committee, an observational and cohort prospective study was conducted on patients scheduled for elective surgery from June to August 2013. The 'Quality of Recovery 15' questionnaire was translated in accordance with available guidelines. The 'Quality of Recovery 15' Portuguese version was used before surgery (T0) and 24h postoperatively (T1) on 170 patients. Patients who were unable to give informed consent or had cognitive impairment were excluded. Poor quality of recovery was defined for 'Quality of Recovery 15' score at T1 lower than the mean 'Quality of Recovery 15' score minus 1 standard deviation. Reliability and observer disagreement was assessed using interclass correlation. Non-parametric tests were used for comparisons. There was a negative correlation between 'Quality of Recovery 15' score and time spent in the postanesthesia care(p = -0.264, p = 0.004) and length of hospital stay (p = -0.274, p = 0.004). Thirty-two patients (19%) had poor quality of recovery. Patients with poor quality of recovery had more frequently diabetes mellitus and hypertension and they were taking antidepressants drugs more frequently. Patients with poor quality of recovery were more frequently submitted to combined anesthesia and less frequently to general anesthesia and locoregional anesthesia (p = 0.008). The questionnaire had a good internal consistency and test-retest reliability was good. The Portuguese version of the 'Quality of Recovery 15' showed a good correlation with the original. This questionnaire appears to be an accurate and reliable assessment for quality of recovery.
