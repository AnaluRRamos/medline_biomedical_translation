Medical or drug-induced abortion has been proven as an effective means for termination of pregnancy. However, training of providers in the use of misoprostol has been limited. The current article aims to identify the degree of knowledge on medical abortion among Brazilian medical residents in Gynecology and Obstetrics. A multicenter cross-sectional study was performed with residents regularly enrolled in residency programs in Gynecology and Obstetrics in 21 teaching hospitals. A self-responded questionnaire was used. Correct responses to each of the alternatives were identified, and a binary response variable (â‰¥ P70, < P70) was defined by the 70th percentile of the number of questions on misoprostol. Four hundred and seven medical residents returned the questionnaire, of which 404 were completed and three were blank. The majority (56.3%) of the residents were 27 years or younger, females (81.1%), and single or not living with a partner (70%). Two-thirds (68.2%) were in the first or second year of residency. Only 40.8% of the participants answered 70% or more of the questions correctly. In the multivariate analysis, enrollment in the third year of residency or greater (OR = 2.18; 95%CI: 1.350-3.535) and having participated in treatment of a woman with induced or probably induced abortion (OR = 4.12; 95%CI: 1.761-9.621) were associated with better knowledge on the subject. Among Brazilian medical residents in Gynecology and Obstetrics, knowledge on medical abortion is very limited and poses an obstacle to proper care in cases of legal termination of pregnancy.
