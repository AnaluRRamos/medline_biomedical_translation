The aim of the study was to evaluate motor functional status measured by motor Functional Independence Measure (mFIM) test in population above 65 years of age after the hip fracture. We evaluated 203 patients after hip fracture by mFIM test on 3 occasions: at admission (Period-1), at discharge (Period-2) and 3 months after discharge (Period-3); 3 age groups: Group(65-74), Group(75-84) and Group(85-up) and 2 groups concerning Severity Index (SI): group 0-1.99 (SI1) and group â‰¥ 2 (SI2). In same SI group there is significant increase in mFIM values for Period-2 and Period-3 for both genders and in first two age groups, while for those above 85 years of age with higher SI we found non-significant change in mFIM values between discharge and 3 months post discharge period. The most significant improvement is obtained for women in first and third age groups and with higher SI. Gender is not significant predictor for motor functional recovery measured by mFIM test in patients with hip fracture, although the admittance mFIM is a good indicator for mFIM capacity recovery in women of certain age groups (first and third age groups).
