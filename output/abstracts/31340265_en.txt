This study aimed to verify the association between perceived barriers to consumption of fruits (CF) and vegetables (CV) with demographic characteristics. A cross-sectional study was performed (n = 877 people with ≤44 years from Cambé (PR), a medium-sized Brazilian city). We investigated five barriers to CF and CV. We used binary logistic regression analysis adjusted for demographic variables. 'Cost burdens family budget' was the most prevalent barrier (CF 57.7%, CV 49.9%), with a greater probability of barrier to CF in women and people with lower schooling (0-4 years/study) and to CV in women, people with lower schooling and economic level B/C. 'Family doesn't have the habit' was mentioned for 16.4% for CF and 10.9% for CV, with a greater probability for people aged 50-59 years in CF. 'Does not have the time to buy fresh food' was quoted by 8.0% (CF) and 7.6% (CV), with a greater probability of the CF barrier in women and single individuals. 'Need to prepare' had a prevalence of 7.6% for CF, with greater probability for those aged 44-59 years and 9.7% for CV, and was higher in women. The prevalence for 'Not liking the taste' was 6.2% for CF and 6.6% for CV, with a greater probability in black/brown/indigenous people.
