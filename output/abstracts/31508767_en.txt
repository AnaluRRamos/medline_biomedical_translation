Gender role social norms influence behaviors and affirm identities and belonging to particular groups. Dominant norms will continue to exist even if they change according to ethical, social and cultural norms. This study validated for the Brazilian reality the Conformity to Masculine Norms Inventory (CMNI-29) and searched for evidence of its applicability to specific factors of the consumption of alcoholic beverages of young university students. We collected data from 341 men in the age group 19-25 years living in the states of Minas Gerais and SÃ£o Paulo. Participants completed the CMNI-29 and questions regarding their alcohol consumption. Even with adaptations to fit the context, the inventory was deemed valid. In general, reliability data were satisfactory and convergent and discriminant validity was achieved for all realms of masculinity. The CMNI-29 proved to be a useful measure to understand the multiple realms of masculinity in behavior. In addition, we found evidence of influence of norms on the frequency of alcohol consumption. The use of the scale broadens the scope of gender research in the country and enables search of its effect with other variables and health behaviors that affect this population.
