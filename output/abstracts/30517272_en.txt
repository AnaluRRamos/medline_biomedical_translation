Present a mapping of the Speech-language Pathology (SLP) practice pathway in verbal expressivity in the work of communicative competence. Study participants were 40 volunteer speech-language pathologists with extensive experience in the area of voice. They responded to questions about duration of work, number of participants, evaluation instruments, and training of the speech language pathologists who work in this area. They discussed specific issues related to the strategies of expressivity proposed and the vocal resources, exercises and terminology used. The group agreed that communicative competence work is practical, conducted with small groups and preferably guided by a voice specialist. Expressivity exercises comprise a large part of the work and aim to promote communication consistent with the context and intention of discourse. Oral reading of texts with different emotions, simulations, and exercises of connected speech were mentioned as frequently-used strategies. Some points to be considered are associated with duration of communicative competence work, teaching-learning and andragogy issues involved in this process, and use of specific terminology in this area. Further discussions involving such aspects seem to be fundamental for the systematic organization of information on the theme.
