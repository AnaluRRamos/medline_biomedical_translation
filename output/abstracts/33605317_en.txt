To understand the meanings attributed by Primary Health Care workers to the professional training process in Integrative and Complementary Practices. Descriptive, exploratory study with a qualitative approach, carried out with 20 professionals from 14 health units in three municipalities in the Metropolitan Region of Goiânia, state of Goiás, Brazil. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews, transcribed and analyzed using the thematic content analysis. Based on the analysis, the thematic category about training trajectories in Integrative and Complementary Practices emerged. It discusses that the training takes place through training provided by federal and municipal management or professional councils, via distance, semi-presential learning or in-person training. Furthermore, training courses are held at private educational institutions funded by the professionals themselves. Additionally, informal sources of information are used to obtain knowledge (internet, books and magazines). The results show, on the one hand, insufficient and diffuse training, with limited supply and quality and, on the other hand, the need to increase educational strategies to improve the training of health professionals aiming at providing different Integrative and Complementary Practices in the Primary Health Care.
