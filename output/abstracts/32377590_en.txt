Occupational accidents in health institutes can result in the transmission of human infectious diseases. Thecollection and processing of biological samples are risk factors for accidents involving clinical laboratory workers. Toidentify occupational accidents with biological material among healthcare workers in the clinical laboratories of Cajazeiras city, Para√≠ba, Brazil. We conducted a cross-sectional and analytical study using a semi-structured questionnaire distributed to 38 workers at six clinical laboratories. Social-demographic data, types of occupational accidents, post-exposure procedures, biosafety practices, and emotional impact were analyzed. Workplace accidents were reported by 22 (57.9%) interviewees. Female gender (81.6%) was more prevalent in this study population. Nurse technicians and biochemists related the most frequent exposures. Accidents occurred mainly in the upper extremities (91%). The biological fluids related to the occupational accidents included blood (81.8%) and urine (45.5%). Thirty-three (86.8%) workers reported undergoing a post-exposure evaluation in the workplace. Fourteen (63.6%) participants underwent laboratory testing after biological material exposure. The data showed that occupational accidents in clinical laboratories are frequent among healthcare workers. We suggest new approaches for occupational accidents in the clinical laboratories to ameliorate the biosafety guidelines and working conditions of healthcare professionals.
