This study aims to identify the epidemiology of orthopedic injuries in jiu-jitsu practitioners. Ninety-six jiu-jitsu practitioners aged between 18 and 45 years, male and female, answered a questionnaire addressing personal data and history of injuries related to the sport during the last 24 months. In the period cover, 85% of the sample presented injuries related to the practice of jiu-jitsu, with an average of 60 days of absenteeism from sports practice. Fingers, shoulders, and knees were the joints most affected by orthopedic injuries. Orthopedic injuries are quite prevalent among jiu-jitsu practitioners, often distancing athletes from the sport. <i>Level of Evidence IV, case series / cross sectional study.</i>
