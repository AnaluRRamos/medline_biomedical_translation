The objective of this study was to allow physicians with self-diagnosed gadolinium deposition disease symptoms to report their own experience. Nine physicians (seven females), with a mean age of 50.5 Â± 8.3 years, participated in this case series. Nationalities were American (n = 6), British, Portuguese, and Romanian. Medical practices included internal medicine (n = 2), trauma surgery, ophthalmology, gastroenterology, psychiatry, family medicine, obstetrics/gynecology, and general practice. Genetically, eight of the physicians were of central European origin. Underlying autoimmune conditions were present in four. Symptoms developed after a single injection in one physician and after multiple injections in eight. The precipitating agent was gadobenate dimeglumine in four physicians, gadobutrol in three, gadoterate meglumine in one, and gadopentetate dimeglumine in one. The most consistent symptoms were a burning sensation, brain fog, fatigue, distal paresthesia, fasciculations, headache, and insomnia. Eight of the physicians were compelled to change their practice of medicine. In the various physicians, gadolinium deposition disease showed common features and had a substantial impact on daily activity. Physicians are educated reporters on disease, so their personal descriptions should spark interest in further research.
