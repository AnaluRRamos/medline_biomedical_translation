To evaluate the accuracy of affordable instruments for hearing screening of adults and the elderly. This study was carried out with users of a Hearing Health Service of the Unified Health System. All were screened with the MoBASA smartphone application, the Telehealth audiometer (TH) and the electronic version of the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly - screening version - eHHIE-S. The examiners were blinded to the results of the screening tests and pure tone audiometry (PTA). Hearing impairment was considered for those with a PTA quadritonal mean greater than 40 dB in the best ear. Sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV, respectively) were calculated. The Kappa index was used as an agreement indicator between the PTA and the screening results. The sample consisted of 80 individuals between 18 and 94 years old (55.18 Â± 20.21). In the PTA test, 21 individuals (26.25%) had typical hearing and 59 (73.75%) hearing loss. In the hearing screening tests, sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV values greater than 75% were observed with the MoBASA as well as in terms of sensitivity and NPV of the TH and the eHHIE-S. The TH and the eHHIE-S specificity and PPV were less than 75%. The Kappa index indicated a substantial agreement (0.6) between the PTA and the MoBASA screening results. The TH and the eHHIE-S showed regular agreement (0.3). MoBASA proved to be an accurate method for hearing screening of adults and the elderly with disabling hearing loss.
