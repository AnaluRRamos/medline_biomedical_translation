To analyze the long-term effects of antineoplastic treatments on patient fertility. 窶サhe studies were selected through the New PubMed, Scielo and Lilacs databases along with references used for the creation of the present work. For the selection of studies, articles published between the periods from January 1, 2015 to April 6, 2020 in the English, Portuguese and Spanish languages were used.
