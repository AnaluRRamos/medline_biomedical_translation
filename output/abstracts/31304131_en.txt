Obtaining stable bone-implant interface, correct alignment of the components, proper balance of soft tissues' tension, maintenance of proper joint interline are fundamental principles for success in surgical revision total knee arthroplasty, which are only obtained with management bone deficiency. However, proper treatment of large defects remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and radiographic results of patients that had underwent revision surgery for total knee arthroplasty with use of structural grafts of musculoskeletal tissue bank in the period between January 2002 to December 2010 by the Knee Surgery Center of National Institute of Traumatology and Orthopaedics (INTO). The study included 26 revision arthroplasties with homologous structural bone grafting in 25 patients. Thirty-four structural bone grafts were used during the 26 revision total knee arthroplasty surgeries studied. The proximal tibia and distal femur were the grafts most frequently used. Six patients developed deep infection and in one of them with damage to the extensor mechanism associated. The average score on the WOMAC was 24,9. In the assessment of functional capacity in the SF-36, the average was 52.5. In radiographic evaluation, resorption of the graft occurred in three patients and no cases were observed of osteolysis, fracture of the graft, migration or subsidence of the components. Bone grafting of a musculoskeletal tissue bank is a satisfactory option to the handling of the bone defect in the setting of revision surgery for total knee arthroplasty.
