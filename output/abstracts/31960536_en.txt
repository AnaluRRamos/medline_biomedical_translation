Canine otitis externa (OE) is a common inflammatory disease that is frequently complicated by secondary bacterial and/or yeast infections. The otic microbial population is more complex than appreciated by cytological methods and aerobic culture alone. Differences in bacterial and fungal populations of the external ear canal will correlate with specific cytological and culture-based definitions of bacterial and Malassezia otitis. Forty client-owned dogs; 30 with OE and 10 with healthy ears. Prospective study comparing cytological samples, aerobic bacterial cultures and culture-independent sequencing-based analyses of the external ear canal. Subjects with OE included 10 dogs with only cocci [≥25/high power field (HPF)] on cytological evaluation and culture of Staphylococcus spp.; 10 dogs with rods (≥25/HPF) and exclusive culture of Pseudomonas aeruginosa; 10 dogs with only yeast on cytological results morphologically compatible with Malassezia spp. (≥5/HPF). Staphylococcus was the most abundant taxa across all groups. Ears cytologically positive for cocci had decreased diversity, and all types of OE were associated with decreased fungal diversity compared to controls. Cytological and culture-based assessment of the ear canal is not predictive of the diverse microbiota of the ear canal in cases of Pseudomonas or Malassezia otitis. Less abundant bacterial taxa in cases of staphylococcal OE are worth scrutiny for future biological therapy.
