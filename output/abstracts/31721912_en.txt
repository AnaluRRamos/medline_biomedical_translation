To evaluate preterm infants' exposure and reactions to intense noise during incubator care. An observational and prospective study was performed in the intermediary care unit of a hospital in Ribeir√£o Preto (SP). Thirty-five preterm infants participated in the first stage of the study (measuring noise) and 20 in the second (analysis of responses to intense noise). Noise was measured for two hours using a dosimeter, and the responses were video recorded by three cameras connected to a computer. The preterm infants' responses to an Lmax higher than 65 decibels were analyzed. Every preterm infant presented Leq above the limit recommended by international organizations, and more than half of the babies had a mean Leq above the limit permitted by the Brazilian standard. Regarding the babies' responses to the intense noise, the majority of them showed blink reflex, startle reflex, facial mimics, changed bodily activities or changed sleep and wake state, all with statistically significant differences. The sound levels measured were intense. The noises that preterm infants are exposed to while being cared for in incubators constitute a stressor event. Sudden, intense noises change their behavioral state and causes reflexive and bodily responses, facial manifestations and changes in their sleep and wake state.
