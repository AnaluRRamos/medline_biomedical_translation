This study discusses the strategies used for approaching the indigenous peoples of Rio Branco by Catholic missionaries of the Consolata Order during the mid-twentieth century. Articles selected from the Missioni Consolata publication were analyzed according to text, image, and context protocol and related to the concepts of field, struggle, and social space from the viewpoint of the sociologist Pierre Bourdieu. Two articles and six images showing strategies undertaken by the missionaries to approach indigenous people and introduce care were linked to the text and context. This analysis shows aspects of the past, without religious filters, related to the use of strategies that may pass unnoticed in politics and in discourse in favor of indigenous health.
