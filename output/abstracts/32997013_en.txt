This paper questions the meanings constructed by professionals of Street Clinics (eCnaR) on the consumption of crack by women and their implications to care practices. This is qualitative research carried out with four eCnaRs (eCnaR) teams working in three territories of the city of Rio de Janeiro, totaling 25 professionals. Produced from focus groups, the empirical data point to the several meanings in the understanding of crack, understood as the 'death drug' or the 'stone of happiness'. Discussion and analysis of data reveal that gender is incorporated controversially in the daily life of services: even if the discourses indicate different patterns of crack use between men and women, access to and use of psychosocial services and in the way of obtaining the drug, women continue to be thought of because of their reproductive capacity. They also point out that even in health care network services, female crack users are stigmatized because they are women who consume crack and because they live in the streets. They indicate that the mother-woman's ideology prevails in the organization of the service network. It is advocated that the empirical-analytical reference of gender studies must be incorporated into the health care policy of crack users.
