We aimed to compare serum levels of S100B between patients with metabolic syndrome and healthy subjects and to investigate the association of S100B with components of the metabolic syndrome. In this study, 44 patients with metabolic syndrome and 44 healthy subjects participated. The participants' body mass index, waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure were measured. Serum levels of low and high density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglyceride, fasting blood glucose, insulin, S100B protein were determined by enzymatic and ELISA methods. The participants with metabolic syndrome had significantly higher levels of S100B than those in the control group (p < 0.0001). Serum levels of S100B protein were positively correlated with abdominal obesity (rho = 0.26; p = 0.01) and serum levels of triglyceride (rho = 0.26; p = 0.01). Moreover, serum levels of S100B were higher in subjects with abdominal obesity (p = 0.02), with higher serum triglyceride levels (p = 0.03) and with hypertension (p = 0.01). The findings indicate that there may be a link between S100B protein with abdominal obesity and serum levels of triglycerides. This warrants further research to elucidate whether increased S100B levels in patients with metabolic syndrome are involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disorders.
