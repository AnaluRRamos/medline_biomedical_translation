The increase in the input of ultra-processed ingredients in the food of children and adolescents is related to the development of noncommunicable diseases such as dyslipidemia. The scope of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature on the relationship of consumption of ultra-processed foods in the lipid profile of children and adolescents. A search in the PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane and LILACS databases was carried out to locate cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, with or without intervention, in apparently healthy children and/or adolescents, who had the intake of ultra-processed food as an exposure variable and the lipid profile as an outcome. After screening, 14 studies were included, of which nine demonstrated that ultra-processed food consumption was related to increased LDL-c, total cholesterol, triglycerides and a reduction in HDL-c. Three studies found no relationship and two demonstrated that the increased intake of ready-to-eat cereals was related to the decrease in total cholesterol and LDL-c. There was a high consumption of ultra-processed foods and positive relation with blood lipids among children and adolescents, which calls attention to interventions, such as nutritional education, with a view to reducing the intake of these foods.
