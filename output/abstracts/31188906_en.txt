To investigate the benefits of the Working Memory Training on DVD for the elderly. Sixteen volunteers aged over 60 years (67.43 years on average), without hearing loss complaint nor neurological or psychiatric disorders participated in this study. All participants were evaluated by the MMSE and a dedicated working memory assessment. Among these, four participants, unable to go to the University formed the control group, while the other twelve were included in the experimental group. The participants in the experimental group were exposed to the first three DVDs with exercises, having been periodically reassessed by the dedicated working memory assessment. The control group participants were submitted only to the reassessments at the same periods as the experimental group. The assessments of the control group did not present any changes, while those in the experimental group significantly improved their results after exposure to the DVDs. Moreover, the experimental group participants reported the benefits of the training for their daily life activities. The present study demonstrates the benefits of the Working Memory Training on DVD for the elderly. These results indicate that the cognitive working memory training may be a promising tool for new longitudinal studies with larger populations.
