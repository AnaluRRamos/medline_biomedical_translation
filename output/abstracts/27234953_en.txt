Peyronie's disease, a fibrotic disorder of the tunica albuginea of the penis, has been associated with penile shortening and some degree of erectile dysfunction. It affects patient's quality of life, leading to severe psychological, mental, and physical stress. Penile deformation hampers sexual life leading to depression, lack of sexual confidence, loss of sexual function and performance anxiety. Peyronie's disease etiology is yet to be known. Literature search was conducted in Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases in January 2015 in order to identify papers related to Peyronie's disease, concerning evolving surgical management, technique, outcomes as well as ancillary treatments. Publications not concerning humans were not considered. We identified original articles, review articles, and editorials addressing the subject. All articles published in the English language were selected for screening. The eligibility criteria for inclusion were based on relevance concerning the subject. The variety of penile deformities associated with Peyronie's disease still doesn't have an effective and reliable non-surgical therapy. We summarize the updated surgical techniques and management algorithm described for Peyronie's disease. Surgical management shares similar goals: correcting the curvature, preserving erectile function and penile length, and minimizing morbidity. To date there is no high level of evidence-based data to determine the best surgical treatment of Peyronie's disease. After proper diagnosis, surgical reconstruction should be based on giving a functional penis, that is, rectifying the penis with rigidity enough to enable sexual intercourse.
