The scope of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate the prevalence and the associated factors of the recommendation of dental extraction in the adult Kiriri Indigenous population of northeastern Brazil. A total of 225 natives (≥19 years) were evaluated. The extraction criteria were teeth with clinical attachment loss ≥50% in at least 3 sites, and residual roots. Statistical models were used to evaluate associations between the need for dental extraction and selected variables. The percentage of teeth recommended for dental extraction was 4.98%, characterizing a mean of 1.24 tooth per individual. A regression analysis showed that age ≥35 years (OR=2.24, 95%CI: 1.13-4.43, p=0.02), income <R$ 570.00 (OR=3.34, 95%CI: 1.19-9.37, p=0.02) and plaque index ≥40% (OR=2.38, 95%CI: 1.24-4.56, p=0,01) were significantly associated with indication for dental extraction. A prevalence of 33% of subjects with dental extraction recommendation were associated with age older than 35 years, plaque index ≥40% and income less than a minimum wage were related with the recommendation for extraction. This study reflects the importance of prioritizing oral health prevention, as well as the need to expand complex dental services.
