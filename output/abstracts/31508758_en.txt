Substance use problems remain at the core of public concern in countries sharing a common culture and a distinct history like Brazil and Portugal. To describe findings of scientific literature about the implications of drug legislation change for the care of drug users in Brazil and Portugal. This is an integrative review of literature that considers inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample selection, analyses and categorization of 21 articles selected that were published in databases PubMed, SciELO and Biblioteca do Conhecimento on-line (B-ON) and included ordinances and laws related to the subject. We observed that production on the repercussions of changes of legislation on care is scarce. Alcohol and tobacco are still a matter of concern in both countries. In Portugal, concerns about heroin-related issues have declined in recent years, but opioids use prevalence rates remain well above those of Brazil. Crack-related problems are a Brazilian reality without parallel in Portugal. In both cases, some actions are in place to change the policy in favor of a reduced repressive approach, with differentiation between users and drug dealers, increased punishment of dealers and reduced punishment of drug users.
