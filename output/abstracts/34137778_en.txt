Dental anatomy can vary significantly between different populations from different countries. Dental anatomical variations are of great interest to the dental professional, especially to endodontists, since they can influence the outcome of endodontic treatment. The purpose of the present study was to describe the anatomical variations of the root canal in mandibular first premolars in a population from Colombia, using micro-computed tomography. Fifty mandibular first premolars were scanned on a SkyScan 1174 and the microcomputed tomographic images were reconstructed. Anatomy was assessed using three-dimensional models. The parameters used were: Vertucci's classification, area and volume, perimeter, circularity, and major and minor diameter at 1, 2 and 3 mm from the apical foramen. According to the Vertucci's classification, teeth were classified as: types I (40%), V (24%), VII (4%) and III (4%), with 28% not classifiable. C-shaped canals were found in 1.8% of the sample. Mean evaluations at 1, 2, 3 mm of the foramen were as follows, respectively: perimeter 1.07 ± 0.57, 1.27 ± 0.78 and 1.57 ± 0.84 mm; circularity 0.59 ± 0.19, 0.57 ± 0.20 and 0.56 ± 0.22; maximum diameter 0.41 ± 0.23, 0.48 ± 0.33 and 0.60 ± 0.37 mm; minimum diameter 0.24 ± 0.10, 0.26 0.11 and 0.21 ± 0.13 mm. Mean total area and volume were 61.27 ± 16.47 mm2 and 12.47 ± 4.95 mm3, respectively. There was wide anatomical variation in mandibular first premolars from Colombian individuals, reinforcing the need for proper anatomical knowledge to establish more effective strategies for endodontic treatment.
