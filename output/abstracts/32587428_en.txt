In recent decades, there has been a significant increase in the number of imaging examinations performed on pregnant patients. That increase has occurred across the various modalities, including ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. However, little is known about the risks that these examinations generate for the mother and fetus, related to the use of ionizing radiation or the use of contrast media. When pregnant patients are submitted to imaging studies, the principles of protection established by the International Commission on Radiological Protection should always be respected, to avoid injury to the pregnant woman and the fetus. The potential deleterious effects on the fetus must be weighed against the damage caused by not performing an examination that is clearly indicated, given that a delayed or missed diagnosis can be even more harmful to the health of the mother and of the fetus itself. The purpose of this review article is to address concerns regarding the safety of imaging methods used during pregnancy, as well as to identify typical clinical situations that require decisions to be made about the indication and optimal planning of imaging examinations.
