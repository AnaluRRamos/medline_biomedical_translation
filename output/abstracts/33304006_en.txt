To identify the main hemorrhagic complications after percutaneous nephrolithotomy, as well as the results obtained with transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) at an interventional radiology center. This was a retrospective analysis of patients undergoing TAE for the treatment of hemorrhagic complications after percutaneous nephrolithotomy. All patients underwent computed tomography angiography (CTA). We evaluated a total of nine patients. At emergency department readmission, the most common symptom was macroscopic hematuria, which was seen in five patients. Three patients had an isolated pseudoaneurysm, two had a pseudoaneurysm together with active bleeding (perirenal hematoma), and one had a pseudoaneurysm together with arteriocalyceal fistula. Arteriovenous fistula was diagnosed in three patients and was not seen in combination with other vascular lesions. We did not identify arteriocalyceal fistula in isolation. Five patients underwent TAE with 6 × 15 mm and 6 × 20 mm microcoils. Four patients underwent TAE with n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate and ethiodized oil. Follow-up CTAs revealed no complications. Because of its high diagnostic accuracy, CTA provides the interventional radiologist with valuable data for individualized therapeutic planning. The TAE procedure is safe and effective. It can therefore be used as a first-line treatment for hemorrhagic complications resulting from percutaneous renal procedures.
