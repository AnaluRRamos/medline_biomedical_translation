The study estimated parameters for planning and programming the supply of procedures for screening, diagnostic workup, and treatment of precursor lesions of uterine cervical cancer. These estimates were used as the basis for assessing the adequacy of Brazil's production of procedures performed by the Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS) in 2017. Estimates were calculated using as the reference the recommended management in the national screening guidelines. Data on screening tests were obtained from the Information System on Uterine Cervical Cancer and the follow-up data from patient charts in a referral center for cervical pathology. Brazil's production of procedures was obtained from data in the Outpatient and Hospital Information Systems of the SUS. For every one hundred thousand women in the target age bracket for screening (25 to 64 years) there was an estimated annual need for 44,134 cytopathology tests, 1,886 colposcopies, 275 biopsies, 236 type 1 and 2 outpatient exicision procedures, 236 type 2 and 3 hospital exicision procedures, and 39 high-complexity referrals for surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiotherapy. Applying the estimated parameters to the number of women screened in Brazil in 2017, a deficit was identified in all the procedures for adequate follow-up of the women with altered test results, varying from 7% in colposcopies to 74% in type 3 excisions. The results point to the need to expand and upgrade the supply of line of care procedures for cervical cancer. The estimated parameters can support policymakers in programming and implementing organized screening programs.
