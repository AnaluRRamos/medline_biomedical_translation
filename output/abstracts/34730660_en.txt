This article aims to assess the association between being a prisoner or homeless and treatment failure in cases of tuberculosis diagnosed in Brazil in 2015. We examined cases of tuberculosis in prisoners and the homeless in Brazil in 2015 reported to the national notifiable diseases information system using descriptive analysis and logistic regression. There were 82,056 cases of tuberculosis in 2015. Of these, 7,462 (10.3%) were prisoners and 2,782 (3.9%) were homeless. The rate of treatment success in prisoners was 78.6%, while the rate of failure in the homeless was 63.2%. Being a prisoner was a protective factor against treatment failure (adjusted odds ratio 0.68, 95%CI 0.63-0.73), while being homeless was a risk factor for treatment failure (adjusted odds ratio 2.38, 95%CI 2.17-2.61). Treatment success and failure rates differed between prisoners and the homeless. Our findings reinforce the need for public health policies tailored to the specific needs of these groups implemented in conjunction with social services and public security agencies in order to have a significant impact on TB incidence.
