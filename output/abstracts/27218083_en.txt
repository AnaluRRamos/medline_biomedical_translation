To analyze the radiographic positioning of the femoral tunnel and correlate this with the postoperative clinical results among patients undergoing reconstruction of the medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) alone. This was a retrospective study in which 30 knees of 26 patients with recurrent dislocation of the patella that underwent MPFL reconstruction were evaluated. The femoral insertion point of the graft and the postoperative clinical condition were analyzed and correlated using the Kujala and Lysholm scales. 22 knees presented a femoral tunnel in the anatomical area (group A) and 8 outside of this location (group B). In group A, the mean score on the Kujala scale was 89.68 points and on the Lysholm scale was 92.45 points. In group B, the mean score on the Kujala scale was 84.75 points and on the Lysholm scale was 92 points. The difference between the means was not significant on either of the two scales. Correlation with the clinical results did not show any difference in relation to the positioning of the femoral insertion of the graft.
