In July 2015, Brazil reported an association between Zika virus infection and Guillain-Barre syndrome, and then in October 2015, between Zika and microcephaly. Most countries and territories in the Region of the Americas were later affected by the virus, creating a public health emergency. Each year, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), Regional Office of the World Health Organization commemorates World Radiology Day (WRD), which highlights the role of radiology in public health. In 2016, PAHO devoted its WRD efforts to the Zika infection. Experts and partners presented and discussed the various radiological findings of Zika infection, the crucial role of obstetric ultrasound in the screening and monitoring of abnormalities associated with confirmed Zika virus infection, and the appropriateness of utilizing other neuroimaging technologies to study brain abnormalities in neonates and infants with prenatal Zika virus infection. The conclusions of WRD 2016 recommend that upon confirmation, prenatal ultrasound be used as the main tool to investigate and monitor suspected cases, with subsequent multidisciplinary postnatal assessments that include neuropediatric clinical studies and relevant neuroimaging. Additionally, radiology technicians should be adequately trained and a quality assurance program should be implemented to ensure timely, safe, and accurate diagnosis.
