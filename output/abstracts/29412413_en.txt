This study sought to validate the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI) measurement scale in Brazil. The methodology included data collection through a quantitative survey with 273 people. Structural equation modeling was used for data analysis. The scale was validated after being subjected to all statistical assumptions, reducing the original 16 to 13 variables resulting in an enhanced measurement capacity of the Burnout syndrome than the original scale. This study contributes a scale adapted to Brazil to study the health of the worker, since it provides a way to measure a syndrome responsible for problems of various types, with impacts both inside and outside organizations.
