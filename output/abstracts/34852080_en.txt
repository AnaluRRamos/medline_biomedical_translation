Regulatory science involves articulating knowledge that can establish the scientific bases for the definition of adequate and efficient regulatory mechanisms and practices. The interfaces between systemic and sectoral health and technological development policies were studied based on documentary analysis, especially from the National Pharmaceutical Policy (PNAF), with impacts on health regulation and stimulating the production of medicines of interest to the Unified Health System (SUS). The initiatives for the nationalized production of ARV 'Efavirenz', which was the subject of a compulsory license in 2007, and the establishment of Partnerships for Productive Development (PDP), contributed to defining innovative regulatory frameworks and practices, emphasizing the Regulatory Technical Committees (CTR) for monitoring the internalization of technologies and health registration of the resulting products. The permeation capacity of the principles and strategic axes of the PNAF was identified in the sectoral policies that were analyzed. As of 2014, no macro or sectoral policies on expanding access to medicines in the SUS with impacts on regulations were identified.
