To correlate the functional outcome and radiographic indices of proximal humerus fractures treated with locking plate. Seventy patients with proximal humerus fractures treated with locking plate, with mean follow-up of 30 months. These patients were analyzed for the score of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) for the operated shoulder, range of motion measurements and radiography of both shoulders. After that, a graphical correlation was established between the radiographic measurements and the functional outcomes. 78% good and excellent results according to the UCLA score, with mean130° elevation; 45° lateral rotation; and thumb-T10 medial rotation. The type of fracture according to the Neer classification and age had a significant correlation with the range of motion. An association was found between the lowest mean elevation and the UCLA score when the neck-shaft angle variation in the antero-posterior plane was greater than 15° varus (p <0.001). The variation of the neck-shaft angle measurement in the anteroposterior plane showed significant correlation with the range of motion and can be one of the predictors of functional results in proximal humerus fractures treated with locking plate. <b><i>Level of evidence III, Retrospective Study.</i></b>
