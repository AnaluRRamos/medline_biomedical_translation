Dermatobia hominis (D. hominis) is a botfly that causes furuncular myiasis in several species of domestic and wild animals. However, reports of feline infestation by larvae of this dipteran are rare. To report the natural occurrence of furuncular myiasis caused by D. hominis in five cats and the efficacy of topical fluralaner for its treatment. Five adult mixed-breed cats (four males, one female) were diagnosed and treated, all living in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The cats were treated with topical fluralaner. After this treatment, the larvae were dead after 24 h in three cats and after 48 h in two. There was spontaneous expulsion of larvae in two cats, and it was necessary to perform manual expression for removal of dead larvae in the other three cats. Dermatobia hominis can cause furuncular myiasis in cats, although this appears to be less common than in other animal species. Topical fluralaner proved to be effective in the treatment of this parasitic disease.
