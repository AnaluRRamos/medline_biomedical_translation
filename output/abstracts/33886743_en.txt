to analyze the composition of teams and the geographical distribution of the services and professionals of the Health Care Network for People with Disabilities (RCPD, initials in Portuguese). cross-sectional observational study developed from secondary data on the specialized component in rehabilitation, with a sample of 3,271 professionals. half of the services was observed in three broad regions; there is a greater representation of Specialized Services in Intellectual Disability Rehabilitation (SERDI, initials in Portuguese), private services and physiotherapists. We observed that most services had full teams; however, most of them do not comply with the minimum workload established by national policy. The Enlarged Health Regions of Jequitinhonha, Norte and the Centros Especializados em Reabilitação (CER, initials in Portuguese) modality presented the highest averages in terms of professionals and workload. Our results show a significant statistical association between full teams and private services. these results have the potential to contribute to the development of strategies to minimize the disparities found in the geographical distribution, in rehabilitation modalities, and public service investments.
