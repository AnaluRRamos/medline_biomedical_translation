Anosognosia is often found in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but its relationship with cognitivebehavioral changes is not well established. To verify if anosognosia is related to cognitive-behavioral disturbances, and to regional brain dysfunction as evaluated by neuroimaging. We included AD patients with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores of 12 through 24, and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scores of 1 or 2. Dementia diagnosis was based on DSM-IV and NINCDS-ADRDA criteria.We used Self-Consciousness Questionnaire (SCQ) and Denial of Illness Scale (DIS), and following neuropsychological counterproofs: WAIS-R digit span, Rey auditory verbal learning, verbal fluency test (category: animals), Cummings' neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI) and Cornell scale for depression in dementia (CSDD). We studied 21 patients (12 men, 9 women) with AD (14 mild, 7 moderate), age 72.4±8.5 years, education 4.9± 4.2 years, and MMSE score 18.2±5. SCQ and DIS did not correlate to age, education, or regional cerebral perfusion defects, but they tended to correlate to disease duration (and only SCQ also to MMSE). SCQ and DIS were correlated neither to CSDD, NPI, CDR, nor to any neuropsychological test. Significant correlations were found between SCQ and DIS, as well as between SCQ domain of 'moral judgment' and MMSE. SCQ and DIS were not correlated to age, education, disease duration, cognitive-behavioral measures, dementia severity, or regional cerebral perfusion defects, but were correlated to each other, suggesting SCQ and DIS evaluate similar mental functions.
