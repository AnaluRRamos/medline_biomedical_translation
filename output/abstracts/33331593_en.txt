Healthy and sustainable territories correlate with health promotion and human development, the reduction of existing vulnerabilities in the territory, and sustainable development. The study's objective is to develop a Healthy and Sustainable Territory Index, with indicators from 2010 secondary data, for territorial classification in priority action in healthy and sustainable territories. The index drew on data from the Brazilian National Population Census of 2010, the basis for calculation of indicators in the United Nations Development Program and the Institute for Applied Economic Research. The index is formed from 12 indicators, seven of which from the vulnerability dimension and five from human development. The score varies from 0 to 12, where higher scores correspond to lower priority for action in the territory. The reference for the calculation was interquartile range of each indicator in the index, and the analytical units were the municipalities (counties) of the states in the Semiarid Region. The results supported the validity of the index, since its score increased with the human development indicators and decreased as social vulnerability increased. There was an indication of greater priority for action in municipalities situated in the Semiarid Region. The expectation is for use of the index as a source of information for analysis at the municipal scale in the states of the Semiarid Region, aimed at assisting the development of public policies, action by organized social movements, and more in-depth studies, aimed at the region's healthy and sustainable development.
