To compare the structure and the work process in Primary Care for implementing medical teleconsultation in municipalities in different regions and with different population sizes (<25,000; 25,000-100,000; >100,000 inhabitants). Cross-sectional study, with descriptive and bivariate analysis, using data from 2017-2018 to assess the availability of computers with internet access, webcam, microphone, speaker, as well as to assess the work processes (use of Telehealth, service supply and demand control center, and communication flow). 30,346 primary health centers and 38,865 teams were evaluated. Presence of teleconsultation equipment in the health centers ranged from 1.2% in large northern municipalities to 26.7% in small southern municipalities. Established work process ranged from 10.7% in small northern municipalities to 39.5% in large southern municipalities. Compared to the South, medium-sized municipalities in the North (OR=0.14 - 95%CI 0.11;0.17) and Northeast (OR=0.21 - 95%CI 0.18;0.25) regions were less likely to have the necessary equipment. Significant regional inequalities call for investments in Digital Health.
