The consolidation of practices aimed at enhancing resilience corroborates the current paradigm shift within the scope of adolescent health promotion, in which the individual's singularity is considered, as well as his/her relationship with the environment. The scope of the undertaking was to identify protective factors involved in the process of resilience among adolescents. This paper reviews indexed publications describing adolescent care models and interventions. The analysis of the texts consisted of: 1) comparing the similarities and differences between the concepts used; and 2) identifying, grouping and compiling the most cited protection factors. A total of 17 articles that strive to enhance resilience in six different practical contexts were analyzed. Based on the protection factors found, 17 actions were generated to guide the development of educational works in health. Protective factors related to 'Problem solving', 'Valorization of the individual' and 'Ability in communication' were identified in several contexts of study on adolescence. These factors represent transversal aspects necessary to enhance resilience and should be stimulated together in order to foster the healthy development of adolescents.
