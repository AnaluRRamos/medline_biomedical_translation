To describe the prevalence of health services utilization for control of arterial hypertension (AH) and diabetes mellitus (DM) in the city of SÃ£o Paulo in 2003, 2008 and 2015 and to analyze associated factors to this utilization in 2015. Data regarding adults who participated in the Health Surveys conducted in the city of Sao Paulo, ISA-Capital 2003, 2008 and 2015, were analyzed. Prevalences and 95% confidence intervals for the three years were estimated to describe the prevalence of the use of services to control HA and DM. For the year of 2015, prevalences of the same variables were estimated according to sociodemographic, geographic and health characteristics. Multinomial logistic regression was used to estimate AH and DM analysis models. There was a significant increase in the prevalence of people who reported routine health services utilization to control AH and DM in the period 2003-2015. For 2015, an increased routine health services utilization to control AH was observed among elderly and those who reported health insurance. For those who reported DM, an association between health services utilization and low schooling was found. Being elderly reduces the risk of not going to the health services to control AH, while being male and not having a health insurance increase this risk significantly. to identify how individuals with AH and DM use health services in way to control these diseases is very important to reduce access barriers and, yet, provide guidance in health policies to reduce disparities.
