Complete revascularization is the gold standard of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). However, the rationale for revascularization of all diseased vessels is questionable. We aimed at evaluating the impact of multiple versus single grafts in each diseased coronary territory in the long-term survival and incidence of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE). From January/00 to November/15, 5.694 consecutive patients were submitted to isolated CABG, of whom 4.243 (74.5%) had complete anatomical revascularization and constituted the study population. Patients were divided into two groups: multiple grafts to each major territory (RCA, LAD, Cx, n=755) a single graft to each territory (n=3.488). Mean follow-up time was 8.5±4.4 years and complete for 96.4% of patients. No differences were found concerning major immediate postoperative complications (cardiogenic shock, acute myocardial infarction or stroke) and thirty-day mortality was similar (0.7%; p=0.871). Long-term survival was 64.4±1.3% vs. 67.7±2.9%, p=0.232. Older age (HR:1.07; 1.06-1.08, p<0.001), diabetes mellitus (HR:1.44; 1.24-1-66, p<0.001), peripheral vascular disease (HR: 1.52; 1.29-1.81, p<0.001), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR:1.38; 1.01-1.89, p=0.042), moderate/ severe cardiac dysfunction (HR:1.95; 1.60-2.38, p<0.001) and moderate/severe renal impairment (HR:1.65; 1.40-1.94, p<0.001) were independent predictors for late mortality. Freedom from MACCE was higher in multiple graft group (79.4±2.0% vs. 90.7±2.7%; p=0.026, respectively) at 4 years. Isolated CABG can be performed safely and with very low mortality. The number of bypass grafts did not adversely affect the perioperative results and long-term survival. However, implantation of multiple grafts was associated with lower incidence of major adverse events.
