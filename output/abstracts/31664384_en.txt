This study aimed to determine the impact of health on the quality of life (QoL) and quality of working life (QWL) of university teachers. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 284 teachersin the areas of health, sciences, human sciences, and agricultural sciences using a sociodemographic questionnaire containing health-related questions, the WHOQOL-bref, and TQWL-42. Results: the findings showed that teachers who practiced physical activity had better QoL,QWL, and sleep quality. Advanced age was also associated with better QoL.Furthermore, QoL and QWL were lower in teachers who used medications, had an imbalanced diet, and did not practice leisure activities. QoL and QWL are influenced by health-related factors.
