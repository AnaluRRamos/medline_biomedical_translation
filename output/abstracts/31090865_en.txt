to determine the expression of neurotrophins and their tyrosine-kinase receptors in patients with osteosarcoma (OS) and their correlation with clinical outcomes. we applied immunohistochemistry to biopsy specimens of patients consecutively treated for primary OS at a single institution between 2002 and 2015, analyzing them for expression receptors of tyrosine kinase A and B (TrKA and TrKB), neural growth factor (NGF) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Independently, two pathologists classified the immunohistochemical markers as negative (negative or weak focal) or positive (moderate focal/diffuse or strong focal/diffuse). we analyzed data from 19 patients (10 females and 9 males), with median age of 12 years (5 to 17.3). Tumors' location were 83.3% in the lower limbs, and 63.2% of patients had metastases at diagnosis. Five-year overall survival was 55.3%. BDNF was positive in 16 patients (84%) and NGF in 14 (73%). TrKA and TrKB presented positive staining in four (21,1%) and eight (42,1%) patients, respectively. Survival analysis showed no significant difference between TrK receptors and neurotrophins. primary OS samples express neurotrophins and TrK receptors by immunohistochemistry. Future studies should explore their role in OS pathogenesis and determine their prognostic significance in larger cohorts.
