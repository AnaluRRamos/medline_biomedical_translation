Cutaneous histiocytomas (CH) are derived from epidermal Langerhans cells. Single CH are generally associated with a good prognosis in dogs because most undergo spontaneous remission. However, aggressive behaviour and lymph node metastasis have been reported in a small number of dogs with single CH. To describe the clinical presentation, treatment and disease progression of an aggressive CH located in the ear canal of a dog. An 8-year-old intact male Rottweiler dog. A unilateral ear canal mass was identified as a CH on routine haematoxylin and eosin stained samples. The diagnosis was confirmed by the demonstration of markers associated with Langerhans cells (Iba-1, E-cadherin and CD18) and the absence of markers associated with B cells (CD79a, CD20, Pax5), T cells (CD3), plasma cells (Mum-1) and macrophages (CD11d, CD204). A total ear canal ablation was performed, but tumour cells extended throughout the horizontal canal and to the deep surgical margin. Due to the locally invasive nature of the mass and incomplete excision, adjunctive chemotherapy with CCNU was pursued. No measurable local disease was appreciable at the time of the last treatment. At 250Â days post-surgery the dog was euthanized owing to the development of multiple abdominal masses. No evidence of local tumour recurrence was noted. Although single CH are typically associated with benign behaviour, the mass in this dog demonstrated locally invasive behaviour. Cutaneous histiocytomas in the ear canals of dogs may represent a particularly aggressive variant of the condition.
