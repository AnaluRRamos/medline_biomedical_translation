The Fundão dam (Minas Gerais, Brazil) breach resulted in the transport and deposition of Fe mine tailings and debris for approximately 670 km along the Doce River watershed. Following the event, an extensive water quality monitoring program was implemented. The results generated by this program were used to assess the temporal and spatial impacts of the event on water quality. Data from several sampling sites situated along affected watercourses collected from 6 November 2015 to 27 September 2017 were evaluated. The sampling area was grouped into 4 zones delineated by hydropower plant dams located along the Doce River watershed and divided into 5 distinct time periods related to hydrological seasonality. Data were also compared to the Brazilian standards of water quality and available pre-event conditions. Principal component analysis followed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests were performed to evaluate the observed temporal and spatial trends and patterns. The results indicated that concentrations of 58 water quality parameters increased with the arrival of the tailings wave released by the breach, generally exceeding pre-event and regulatory levels. Persistent or seasonally recurring concentrations were observed for 30 water quality parameters. Concentrations of total and dissolved forms of Fe, Al, Mn, total P, total suspended solids, and turbidity tended to increase during the wet season and decrease during the dry season, this trend being more pronounced close to the dam. The water quality changes were more pronounced immediately after the arrival of the tailings wave, gradually decreasing over time and returning prebreach conditions, but fluctuated seasonally in response to the natural variation in river flow.
