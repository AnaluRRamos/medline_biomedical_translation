Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has a physical, psychological and social impact, often compromising the patient's ability to perform daily activities. Recently a new measurement for disability in IBD was developed. The Inflammatory Bowel Disease-Disability Score (IBD-DS) comprises the following domains: mobility, self-care, major daily life activities, gastrointestinal-related problems, mental health and interaction with the environment. The aim of our study was to translate to Portuguese and to validate the IBD-DS. Eighty-five patients, 55 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 30 with ulcerative colitis (UC), completed the Portuguese version of the IBD-DS and the short inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (SIBDQ-10 questions). Disease activity was assessed using the Harvey-Bradshaw (HB) for CD and partial Mayo score (pMayo) for UC. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to assess the correlation between the IBD-DS and SIBDQ. The Student's <i>t</i>-test was used to compare the mean of IBD-DS between active and inactive disease. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 21.0 and the statistical level of significance (<i>α</i>) was established at 5%. In our study, a significant negative correlation between the IBD-DS and the SIBDQ was observed (<i>r</i> = -0.858, <i>p</i> < 0.001 for CD and <i>r</i> = -0.933, <i>p</i> < 0.001 for UC). There was a statistically significant difference of the mean of IBD-DS between inactive <i>vs.</i> active disease (93.78 <i>vs.</i> 117.57, <i>p</i> = 0.016 for CD and 78.96 <i>vs.</i> 137.14, <i>p</i> < 0.001 for UC). The Portuguese version of the inflammatory bowel disease-disability score has a strong correlation with patients' quality of life and clinical disease activity and was shown to be a valid tool to measure disability in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
