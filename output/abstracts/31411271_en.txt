This study aimed to investigate factors associated with orthostatic hypotension in 14,833 individuals 35-74 years of age. This was a cross-sectional study of baseline data (2008-2010) from the Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil). Postural testing was performed after 20 minutes resting in supine position and active adoption of orthostatic posture. Blood pressure was measured in supine position and at 3 minutes in orthostatic position with an oscillometer (HEM 705 CP, Omron, São Paulo, Brazil). Orthostatic hypotension was defined as a drop of ≥ 20mmHg in systolic blood pressure and/or a drop of ≥ 10mmHg in diastolic blood pressure. The target covariates were sex, age bracket, race/color, schooling, nutritional status, waist circumference, alteration in the ankle-brachial index, pulse wave velocity, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, hypertension, diabetes, use of antihypertensives, cholesterol, triglycerides, Chagas disease serology, symptoms, and heart rate variation in the postural test, self-reported heart disease, acute myocardial infarction (AMI)/revascularization, and stroke. Orthostatic hypotension was significantly associated with higher age bracket, OR = 1.83 (95%CI: 1.14-2.95); alteration in the ankle-brachial index, OR = 2.8 (95%CI: 1.13-6.88); AMI/revascularization, OR = 1.70 (95%CI: 1.01-2.87); report of heart disease, OR = 3.03 (95%CI: 1.71-5.36); increased systolic blood pressure, OR = 1.012 (95%CI: 1.006-1.019); positive Chagas disease serology, OR = 2.29 (95%CI: 1.23-4.27); and occurrence of symptoms with postural change, OR = 20.81 (95%CI: 14.81-29.24). Presence of orthostatic hypotension can be a warning sign for cardiovascular disorders and thus a useful tool for screening and prevention.
