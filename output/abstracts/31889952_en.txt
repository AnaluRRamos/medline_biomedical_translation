Excess sodium intake is associated with adverse health effects, and reducing its intake is a strategy that improves population health. However, estimating sodium intake is challenging and new options for assessment are needed. This review describes the design and development of a web-based, publicly-accessible, dietary sodium intake screening tool (<i>Calculadora de Sodio</i>) for individuals in Mexico. Sodium data from 2017 - 2018 for 3 429 packaged foods, 655 restaurant and cafeteria foods, and 320 home-style meals and street foods (determined by chemical analysis) comprised the 71-question tool. It was piloted with 10 nutrition experts for feedback on content and face validity; and with 30 potential users to test its usability and interface. Improvements were made to content, language, and formatting following the pilot. Its predictive validity will be established in the future. The <i>Calculadora de Sodio</i> provides instant feedback on an individual's average daily sodium intake, computed by frequency of intake, average number of servings, and sodium content per serving of each sodium-focused food category. This is the first web-based dietary sodium screening tool developed for the general population of Mexico. It is an efficient and practical way to assess sodium intake and can serve as a model for similar tools for other countries and regions.
