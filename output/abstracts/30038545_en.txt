The extreme lateral approach has been widely used for the treatment of degenerative diseases. The objective of this study is to present a minimally invasive extreme lateral approach for the treatment of metastatic lesions in the lumbar spine without the use of the evoked potential exam (MEP). Two patients with spinal metastases and indication for surgery via the anterior approach were treated in a cancer referral center in Brazil. They were placed in right lateral decubitus, and an oblique incision was made, exposing the psoas muscle. The anterior approach permitted the release of the psoas muscle from vertebral body and disc, without the need for MEP. When cancer cure is no longer possible, a minimally invasive extreme lateral approach to treat tumor metastases in the lumbar spine is a viable option, with short hospitalization time and low morbidity. The dislocation of the psoas muscle avoids the use of the transpsoas approach, which requires MEP equipment and a trained physician. Clinical studies are needed to extend these benefits to oncological patients who have treatment options for their primary disease. <i><b>Level of Evidence IV; Case series.</b></i>
