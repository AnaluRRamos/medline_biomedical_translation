The objective is to verify associations between variables related to precarious employment and absence from work due to health reasons in the nursing field. This was a cross-sectional study of a stratified convenience sample with proportional allocation of 1,075 workers. Study site: 22 public hospitals in Bahia, with data collected between 2015 and 2016.The assessed precarious employment dimensions were: Forms of insertion and intensity of work, Physical effort and working environment, Disorder and disturbances during work. The binary logistic regression was adjusted with the Omnibus test. The variables that were significant for both nurses and for nursing aides and technicians were repetitive effort (OR = 0.44, CI = 0.22-0.91 / OR = 0.54, CI = 0.29-0.98), and history of discrimination (OR = 2.1, CI = 1.6-4.3 / OR = 1.8, CI = 1.2-2.5). For the nurses, the existence of noise in the work environment was significant for work leave (OR = 3.7, CI = 1.7-8.2). Among the nursing aides and technicians, the occurrence of violence at the workplace (OR = 1.4, CI = 1.05-2.0), adequacy of the resting area (OR = 0.6, CI = 0.41-0.89), and type of employment bond (OR = 1.5, CI = 1.009-2.09) were significant. The results reveal the precariousness in the field and that the government favors the illness of these workers by maintaining these working conditions.
