To identify food consumption patterns and association between overweight and risk of cardiovascular disease. This was a cross-sectional study with staff of the Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, who took part in the Pró-Saúde Study. Food consumption was investigated using a food frequency questionnaire. Association between dietary patterns (exposure) and overweight and cardiovascular risk (outcomes) was estimated using linear regression. Among the 520 staff assessed, four dietary patterns were found: 'ultra-processed', 'healthy', 'meat' and 'traditional'. After adjustment, the 'meat' pattern was inversely associated with waist circumference (ß=-1.52 - 95%CI -2.66;-0.39), body mass index (ß=-0.56 - 95%CI -1.01;-0.11), and the Framingham Risk Score (ß=-0.36 - 95%CI -0.64;-0.09). In view of excess weight, risk of cardiovascular disease and inverse association between the 'meat' food consumption pattern and BMI, it is important to conduct further investigations, with non-working groups, with the aim of gaining greater understanding of the health-disease process related to food consumption.
