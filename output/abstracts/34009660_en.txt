Malassezia pachydermatis is a commensal organism of the skin, yet it may induce dermatitis and/or otitis. Lactoferricin (Lfcin) is an antimicrobial peptide obtained by the pepsin-mediated digestion of lactoferrin, a multifunctional innate-defence milk protein. The antibacterial activity of Lfcin is thought to cause alteration of bacterial membrane permeability, thus inducing cell death. The aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro antifungal activity of different dilutions of Lfcin solution against M. pachydermatis strains isolated from ears of dogs and cats with otitis externa. Fifty clinical Malassezia isolates from 40 dogs and 10 cats were tested. A dilution method in microtitre plates was used starting with a 20% Lfcin water solution. The different dilutions were 2:1 (13.3%), 1:1 (10%), 1:2 (6.7%), 1:5 (3.3%) and 1:10 (1.8%). Results were expressed as the value at which the growth of 50% (minimal fungicidal concentration MFC<sub>50</sub> ) and 90% (MFC<sub>90</sub> ) of yeast cells was inhibited. All strains showed susceptibility to 20% Lfcin solution (100%). With 1:5 and 1:10 dilutions corresponding to 3.3% and 1.8% Lfcin solutions, all strains showed resistance. The MFC<sub>50</sub> and MFC<sub>90</sub> values were observed at 13.3% and 20% Lfcin solutions. The results indicated that Lfcin solution exhibits the antimicrobial activity specific to antimicrobial peptides. In particular, the 20% solution can be effective in killing M. pachydermatis isolated strains. Some susceptibilities also are evident at lower concentrations of ≤6.7% for four strains.
