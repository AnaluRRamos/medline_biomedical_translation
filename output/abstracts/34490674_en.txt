Because of the increased incidence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria, the use of disinfectants over antibiotics has been encouraged. However, the interactions between disinfectants and host local immunity are poorly understood. To assess the effects of chlorhexidine digluconate (Chx), with and without selected host defence peptides (HDPs), against MDR Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MDR-SP). Ten clinical isolates of MDR-SP were tested, using a modified microbroth dilution method. Four two-fold dilutions of 2% Chx and 1 μg/mL the HDPs synthetic canine β-defensin 103 (cBD103) or cathelicidin (cCath) were tested alone or in combination. Colony counts after 5, 15, 30 and 60 min, and a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) after 24 h were recorded. Friedman followed by Dunn's multiple comparison tests with significance of P < 0.05 were used for statistical analysis. Synergy, additivity/neutrality or antagonism were calculated. Growth was not inhibited by either HDP alone. An MIC of 0.312 μg/mL Chx was achieved for nine of the isolates. One isolate had an MIC of 0.078 μg/mL Chx. A MIC<sub>90</sub> (in nine of 10 isolates) of 0.312 µg/mL was seen for Chx in combination with either HDP. Synergy was seen in the combination Chx/cCath used at the highest concentrations of Chx (0.624 µg/mL and 0.312 µg/mL) after 30 and 60 min incubation. Additivity/neutrality was seen for most of the other concentrations and times of incubation. These results suggest a synergistic/additive effect between Chx and HDPs in dogs. Further studies evaluating the mechanisms behind this effect are needed.
