Cross-cultural adaptation to Brazilian Portuguese and evaluation of content validity of a patient decision aid to help in choosing the feeding route for patients with severe dementia entitled 'Making Choices: Feeding Options for Patients with Dementia'. The cross-cultural adaptation involved two independent translations, synthesis of translations, two independent back-translations, their synthesis, and pretest with 30 caregivers. Content validation was based on analyzes of 35 Brazilian specialists (physicians, speech-language therapists and nurses experienced in caring for patients with severe dementia) through measures of content validity index and concordance between multiple judges by Fleiss' kappa. The level of comprehension of the instrument by caregivers in the pretest was almost perfect. The specialists committee considered the contents of the instrument valid, in a statistically significant way. The patient decision aid in Brazilian Portuguese entitled 'Fazendo escolhas: opções de alimentação para pacientes com demência' obtained evidence of cross-cultural equivalence and content validity for use in the Brazilian population. Further studies are needed to assess its effects on the decision-making process in our population.
