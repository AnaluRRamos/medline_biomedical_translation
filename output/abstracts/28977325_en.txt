To characterize cases of children admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of a tertiary university hospital who died in the period ranging from January 01, 2012 to July 31, 2014, and who required palliative care and/or were subjected to it. A retrospective descriptive study was carried out by reviewing the medical records of these patients to collect data and to perform descriptive statistical analysis. During the study period, 49 children died after at least 48 hours from the time of admission. Of those, 18% children were extremely premature infants and 77% children had malformations. Although necessary for all of the patients in this study, palliative care was provided for only 20% of patients who died. Among the 12 babies who were not resuscitated, 33% of babies were not in palliative care. The Pain and Palliative Care Unit of the institution followed only four neonates in palliative care. These patients were using many invasive devices, had high therapeutic investment, and also altered pain scale scores. This study exhibited a large proportion of newborn infants with serious diseases and health conditions. In a few cases the patients received palliative care, but most of them were not even discussed under palliative point of view. We hope that this study will call attention to the need to propose protocols and implement training for the best treatment of these children.
