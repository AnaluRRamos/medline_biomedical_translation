The article aims to analyze the work process for community health agents (ACS in Portuguese) in remote rural municipalities (counties) and identify specificities and contributions to primary healthcare. The qualitative study included 23 interviews with ACS and nurses in the family health teams in five remote rural counties in western Par√° State, Brazil. Analysis of the work process for ACS covered two interconnected dimensions: scope of practices and qualification for the work. The scope of practices proved to be comprehensive, involving family follow-up, individual care and preventive measures, collective approach, and administrative activities. Home visits are the main activity by ACS and an important form of contact between health services and the clientele, meeting different objectives of enrollment, care, and information. ACS in remote rural communities, usually the only available health resource, display a broader scope of practices than in the municipal seats, including individual procedures. The qualification of ACS for the work can either enhance or limit the development of their practices and was expressed by the high motivation of the ACS, insufficient supervision and continuing education, and low integration with the larger health team. Policies are needed that acknowledge the specificities and guarantee greater support (materials, transportation, and continuing education) for full development of work by ACS in remote rural communities in the Amazon. The expanded set of practices by ACS suggests that they are relevant actors for providing care, facilitating the population's access to the healthcare network, and as a real link between rural populations and health services in remote rural communities.
