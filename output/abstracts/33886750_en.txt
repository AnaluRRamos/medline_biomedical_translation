This study aimed to monitor the trends and projections of targets of risk and protection factors for coping with noncommunicable diseases in Brazilian capitals and verify whether the economic crisis and austerity policies have interfered with these targets' behavior. This is a time-series study with data from the Surveillance System for Risk and Protective Factors for Chronic Diseases by Telephone Survey. We analyzed the trends in the prevalence of tobacco use, obesity, physical activity, consumption of fruits and vegetables, and alcohol abuse, and their projections until 2025. The Prais-Winsten regression was employed. We adopted the Interrupted Time-Series, considering the 2006-2014 and 2015-2019 periods. A reduction in tobacco use, increase in obesity, consumption of fruits and vegetables, physical activity, and alcohol use was observed between 2006 and 2014. Most indicators have shown worse performance since 2015. Projections foresee that targets for curbing obesity and alcohol abuse will not be achieved. Some changes were identified in the indicators profiles, reinforcing the importance of the continuous monitoring and sustainability of actions, policies, and programs to promote health and control these diseases and their risk factors.
