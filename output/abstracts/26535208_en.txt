Tearing of the distal triceps is uncommon and may be difficult to diagnose, especially in situations of partial tearing. Imaging methods such as ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging should be used to confirm the diagnosis and define the extent of the injury. The preferred treatment for complete tearing of the triceps is surgical, unlike in cases of partial tearing, in which the treatment depends on factors such as pain, functional deficit and the patient's expectations. Here, we describe the case of a patient with partial tearing of the distal triceps after falling to the ground, which was not diagnosed at the time of first attendance and evolved with pain and great functional loss. The surgical procedure was performed nine months after the injury, with reconstruction of the triceps by means of reinforcement using the tendon of the ipsilateral semitendinosus and fixation in the olecranon using the double-row configuration. The patient remained immobilized using a sling for one week and then gains in passive range of motion (ROM) were introduced. Three weeks later, the patient was released for gains in active ROM. Muscle strengthening was started after 12 weeks. Six weeks after the surgical procedure, the patient was free from pain and presented complete ROM, grade V elbow extension force and hypertrophy of the triceps. The technique described here was shown to be useful for treating tears of the tendon of the distal triceps.
