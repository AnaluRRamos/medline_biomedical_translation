A four-block exploratory study was conducted with an electronic online, anonymous questionnaire to study the path of postgraduatesÂ  from two professional master's degree classes, as follows: personal, current professional activity, course-professional situation relationship, and open-ended questions for positive/negative points. Results: Most of them remained in the primary care area and public services; in health care and as tutors; developed a course-related work activity, and 75% reported a high impact of the course. A lower effect was perceived in the remuneration. A higher effect was noted in the professional training, the networks of relationships, personal growth, and work. The active pedagogical strategies were well evaluated. Conclusion: This is a feasible and applicable evaluation method for graduate monitoring systems, and it allows knowing the relationship between training and work.
