One of the first steps to be taken in order to reduce sports injuries such as stress fractures is to have in-depth knowledge of the nature and extent of these pathological conditions. We present a case report of a stress fracture of the acetabular roof caused through motocross. This type of case is considered rare in the literature. The description of the clinical case is as follows. The patient was a 27-year-old male who started to have medical follow-up because of uncharacteristic pain in his left hip, which was concentrated mainly in the inguinal region of the left hip during motocross practice. After clinical investigation and complementary tests, he was diagnosed with a stress fracture of the acetabular roof.
