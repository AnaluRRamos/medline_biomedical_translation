This article proposes a set of common basic indicators for occupational health surveillance in the region of Latin America and the Caribbean and identifies the sources of data that are available for their measurement. To this end, consensus was built among members of the Expert Network on Working, Employment, and Health Conditions Surveys (<i>RED ECoTES</i>) in two stages. In the first stage, a preliminary list of indicators was agreed upon; in the second stage, data sources and their characteristics were identified to help determine the feasibility of measuring the actual value of each indicator in 20 countries of the region. The proposed set of basic indicators, together with their definitions, is composed of 13 indicators in four areas: employment conditions (three indicators), working conditions (four indicators), resources and preventive activities (two indicators), and health (four indicators). The primary sources of data available in the region for calculating these indicators were: permanent household surveys; surveys on conditions of work, employment, and health; vital statistics; and reporting systems for occupational injuries. Data are available in the region for many of the proposed indicators, but a sizable number of those having to do with working conditions and preventive activities are not available in most countries. For effective occupational health surveillance in the region, surveys on conditions of work, employment, and health must be vigorously promoted in each country.
