We report the case of a female patient, 58 years of age, without known heart disease, who underwent liver transplantation without complications. On the second postoperative day, the patient developed cardiogenic shock secondary to stress-induced cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo-like syndrome). The patient was successfully managed with veno-arterial peripheral extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for 6 days, with complete recovery of cardiac function and of the hepatic graft. Coronary syndrome and acute myocarditis were excluded as the causes of the shock. The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in this scenario is possible and safe, considering its specialized protocols and treatment.
