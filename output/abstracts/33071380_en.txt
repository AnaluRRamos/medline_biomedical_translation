Although secondary involvement of the broad ligament by malignant tumors arising elsewhere in the abdomen and pelvis is common, primary tumors in this location are rare. Tumors of the broad ligament can be of mesenchymal and mixed nature, such as leiomyoma, the most common neoplasm; epithelial tumors of MÃ¼llerian type, imposing a challenge to differentiate them from other adnexal masses; unique tumors from mesonephric origin; and tumor-like lesions. Most neoplasms in this region, whether benign or malignant, usually present clinically with vague symptoms and are often discovered during a routine gynecological examination. Suspicion of such location and knowledge of the potential range of lesions of this region may allow for planning minimally invasive surgical interventions. To be considered tumor from the broad ligament, it should not be connected with either the uterus or the ovary. Thus, the imaging approach to establish the differential diagnosis includes excluding an ovarian, uterine, or tubal origin by recognizing these separately and by rebutting imaging clues pointing to these origins. This pictorial essay reviews some of the imaging findings that may suggest such location and presents some of the possible differential diagnoses by means of illustrative confirmed cases.
