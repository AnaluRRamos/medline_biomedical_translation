The aim of this paper is to describe the use of a new ultrasound imaging processing technique to guide biopsies of suspicious breast calcifications. We used this technique in 13 patients with suspicious breast calcifications that could not be submitted to stereotactic biopsy. Suspicious calcifications were identified by ultrasound, and the biopsy was successfully performed in all cases. Although mammography continues to be the method of choice for the detection and characterization of microcalcifications, this new technique can be an alternative means of guiding biopsy procedures in selected patients who are not candidates for stereotactic biopsy.
