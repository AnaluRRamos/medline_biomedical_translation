To compare the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in the adult population of Vitória, Espírito Santo, Brazil, in two surveys conducted by telephone interview (VIGITEL) or by clinic and laboratory exams during the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). Data were collected from adults (≥ 18 years). In VIGITEL, 1,996 subjects (males = 38%) were interviewed. In NHIS, home visit followed by clinical and laboratory tests was made with 318 individuals (males = 48%) selected in 20 census tracts of the city. The prevalence of risk factors was adjusted to the estimated population of the city in 2013. Data are shown as prevalence and 95% confidence interval (95%CI). Similar values of prevalence were found in VIGITEL and NHIS, respectively, for smoking (8.2%; 95%CI 6.7-9.7% vs 10.0; 95%CI 6.4 - 13.6%) and hypertension (24.8%; 95%CI 22.6 - 27.0% vs 27.2%; 95%CI 21.8 - 32.5%). Statistical differences between surveys (p < 0.01) were found for diabetes (6.7%; 95%CI 5.6 - 7.9% vs 10.7%; 95%CI 7.1 - 14.5%), obesity (16.8%; 95%CI 14.1 - 18.1% vs 25.7%; 95%CI 20.4 - 30.9%) and high cholesterol (≥ 200mg/dL) (20.6%; 95%CI 18.6- 22.6% vs 42.3%; 95%CI 36.9 - 47.7%). The prevalence of diabetes was also higher (p < 0.01) in NHIS (6.7 vs 10.7%). Prevalence of smoking and hypertension, but not obesity, was adequately detected in VIGITEL, because there might have been information bias related to body weight during telephone interviews. Datashow the necessity to improve the diagnosis of dyslipidemias in primary care services, as the control of this risk factor is of utmost importance to prevent cardiovascular diseases.
