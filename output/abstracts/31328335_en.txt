Symmetrical lupoid onychomadesis (SLO) is a disease not infrequently seen in bearded collie dogs in Germany. The aim of this study was to compare historical and clinical data, as well as the mineral content of the hair and claws of bearded collies with SLO with that of normal control dogs. Twenty-eight affected bearded collie dogs and 39 control dogs. Owners completed an extensive questionnaire regarding upbringing, environmental conditions and diets. Claw specimens were obtained by claw trimming or gathering lost claws; hairs were obtained by plucking samples from several areas of the body; samples were converted to ash and evaluated in an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Clinical signs in affected dogs eventually involved all claws on all paws. In twelve dogs recurrence of onychomadesis was observed. There was no relevant association between gender, housing, diet and health management, physical stress and the development of SLO with exception of the age at which more intense exercise began. The most commonly used treatment combination was fatty acids, pentoxifylline and tetracycline; improvement occurred in 17 animals. Calcium, sodium and phosphorus concentrations were higher in the claws of affected dogs, whereas zinc concentrations were lower. The mineral content of hair samples of the affected dogs was not significantly different than controls. Symmetrical lupoid onychomadesis in bearded collies is clinically similar to what has been described in other breeds with regard to clinical signs and response to treatment. Early strenuous activity may increase the risk for disease occurrence in this breed.
