To develop the cultural and linguistic adaptation of the Brazilian version of the Adapted Borg CR10 for Vocal Effort Ratings. The instrument Adapted Borg CR10 for Vocal Effort Ratings was translated into Portuguese by two Brazilian bilingual speech-language pathologists, whose translations were compiled into one version. Back-translation into English was performed by a third bilingual Brazilian speech-language pathologist who did not participate in the previous stages. After translation and back-translation, the items of the translated version were compared with the original instrument and discrepancies were modified by consensus of a committee composed of three speech-language pathologists, resulting in the version translated into Brazilian Portuguese entitled Escala Borg CR10-BR adaptada para esforço vocal. For cultural equivalence of the Portuguese version, the option 'not applicable' was added to the categorical scale and 15 individuals with dysphonia, with otorhinolaryngological medical diagnosis, responded to the Escala Borg CR10-BR adaptada para esforço vocal after reading the perceptual-auditory evaluation protocol CAPE-V phrases. During the process of translation and cultural adaptation, no item was changed and/or eliminated from the questions. The Escala Borg CR10-BR adaptada para esforço vocal kept the same structure as the original, with a scale ranging from 0 to 10, with 0 being 'no vocal effort at all' and 10 being 'maximum vocal effort'. The Brazilian version of the Adapted Borg CR10 for Vocal Effort Ratings, entitled Escala Borg CR10-BR adaptada para esforço vocal, presents cultural and linguistic equivalence to the original instrument.
