This study is a pre-assessment of homeopathy activities in the municipality of Recife, Pernambuco. Review of official and technical documentation produced a preliminary logical theoretical model for this intervention, based on a matrix of criteria and indicators for evaluation. The model and matrix were submitted to key informants with expertise in the area, and the data were collected from six interviews in 2016. Three major components were seen to be needed for both tools: joint management and coordination; homeopathic care; and education, communication, and social mobilization. We expect the theoretical model and matrix of criteria and indicators which were developed and validated to serve as a reference to establish procedures for monitoring and assessing similar interventions.
