The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of odontogenic infection in low-income Brazilian schoolchildren and evaluate its association with the subjective variables of oral health-related quality of life and dental pain. In this cross-sectional study, 230 schoolchildren aged eight to ten years old underwent a clinical oral survey in which the DMFT/dmft and PUFA/pufa indexes were measured. Afterward, children responded individually to the Child Perceptions Questionnaire (CPQ8-10) and self-reports of dental pain were collected. Data were statistically analyzed using MannWhitney or Kruskal-Wallis test with a post-test by Dunn's and Pearson correlation. Of the children evaluated, 42.6% had odontogenic infection and 80% reported experiencing dental pain. Children's age (p = 0.034) and past experience of dental pain (p < 0.002) were associated with odontogenic sepsis, in addition to impairment of their emotional well-being (p = 0.008), social welfare (p = 0.009) and overall impact on quality of life (p = 0.019). Toothache intensity (p < 0.001), frequency (p < 0.001) and duration (p < 0.001) were correlated to the overall impact on children's quality of life. The prevalence of odontogenic infection remains high among low-income Brazilian schoolchildren. Pediatric infection and its related pain induce not only various biological disorders but also impair children's self-perception of quality of life.
