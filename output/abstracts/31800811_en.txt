To analyze the epidemiology of abandoning clinical and laboratory follow-up among health workers who suffered accidents with biological material. Cohort study based on reported work accidents with biological material in Goiânia/Goiás. Data were analyzed in Stata with descriptive and analytical statistics. 2,104 exposures of the 8,596 reported accidents were analyzed, most of them involving females with completed high school education and belonging to the nursing staff. The accidents predominantly occurred by percutaneous injury involving a needle with lumen during medication administration or vascular access. Follow-up abandonment rate was 41.5%. Predictive factors for discontinuing clinical and laboratory follow-up were age, occupation, use of personal protective equipment (gowns), the object involved in the accident, situation in the labor market, circumstance of exposure and recommended prophylactic conduct. Given the high abandonment rate found, it is suggested to implement strategies to ensure follow-up and reduce risks to health workers.
