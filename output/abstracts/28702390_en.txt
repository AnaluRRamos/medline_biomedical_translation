To evaluate the results of percutaneous golfer's elbow release under local anesthesia. From December 2010 to December 2013, 34 elbows in 34 patients (10 males and 24 females) that presented golfer's elbow for over one year were recruited from the outpatient department. All patients were operated under local anesthesia and were followed-up for 12 months. The functional outcome was evaluated through the Mayo Elbow Performance Index (MEPI). Pain relief was achieved on average eight weeks after surgery. The results were excellent in 88.23% (30/34) cases and good in 11.76% (4/34) cases. Neither wound-related complications nor ulnar nerve complications were observed. On subjective evaluations, 88.23% (30/34) patients reported full satisfaction and 11.76% (4/34) patients reported partial satisfaction with the results of treatment. Percutaneous golfer's elbow release under local anesthesia is a minimally invasive procedure that can be performed in an outpatient setting. This procedure is easy, quick, and economical, presenting a low complication rate with good results.
