Meticillin-resistant (MR) staphylococcal species have been cultured from veterinary hospital environments and veterinary instruments. Pet-grooming salon environments and grooming tools may pose a risk for dissemination of MR staphylococcal bacteria into the pet population. The objectives of this study were to investigate the frequency of MR staphylococcal colonization of pet-grooming salons and to collect information regarding cleaning procedures in grooming salons. A nonrandomized, observational study was performed in 2018. Locations inside 19 grooming salons near Tacoma, WA, USA, were sampled and selectively cultured for MR, coagulase-positive staphylococci. Sampled sites included clipper blades and handles, leashes, rims of bathtub drains, insides of shampoo caps, and bathtub spray hoses or faucet handles. Grooming salons were asked to complete surveys regarding their cleaning practices. Meticillin-resistant coagulase-positive staphylococci were isolated from 12 of 19 grooming salons and 25 of 112 total samples. Meticillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius, S. aureus and S. schleiferi were isolated from multiple salons, most commonly from electric clipper blades, clipper handles and grooming leashes. No statistically significant correlations were identified between cleaning practices and the isolation of MR coagulase-positive staphylococci. Clipper blades, clipper handles and leashes are potential fomites for MR staphylococci in a grooming salon; increased disinfection practices for these items are indicated. A prospective, controlled, large-scale study is warranted to examine the effect of grooming salon hygiene practices on the isolation of MR staphylococci in salons.
