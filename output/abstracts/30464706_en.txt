Treatment of Kienböck's disease is challenging and the variability of results, despite the surgical technique, shows that there must be other aspects that can influence outcomes. The objective of this study is determine, through arthroscopic approach, the pattern of impairment of the carpal bones in Lichtman stage III patients. Wrist arthroscopy was performed in patients with symptoms and evidence of lunate necrosis on x-rays, with signs of 3A and 3B stages. The Outerbridge classification was used to grade the articular status of the carpal bones. Fifteen patients with stage 3 disease were assessed, five of whom were staged as type 3A and ten as 3B using the Lichtman stages. According to the Outerbridge classification, the lunate sulcus was the most affected with means of 2.8 at 3A and 2.9 at 3B. Other areas were significantly less affected with means of 1.1 and 1.3, respectively. Arthroscopic assessment of the wrist could aid in surgical decision making, offering more details on cartilage status in stage 3 Kienböck's disease. <b><i>Level of Evidence III, Study of nonconsecutive patients, without consistently applied reference 'gold' standard.</i></b>
