There is still no consensus as to the best form and dosages of use of tranexamic acid. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of tranexamic acid in total hip arthroplasty, in order to reduce blood loss and decrease hemoglobin, taking into account different administration protocols. 42 patients submitted to total hip arthroplasty were divided into three groups. The study was prospective and randomized. Group 1 received a venous dose of tranexamic acid of 15 mg/kg, 20 min prior to bolus incision. Group 2 received an intravenous dose of 15 mg/kg bolus, 20 min before the incision, and an extra dose of 10 mg/kg by infusion pump during the duration of the surgical procedure. Patients in group 3 did not receive tranexamic acid, being the control group. Pre- and post-operative hemoglobin levels were measured and blood loss was measured 24 h after surgery using a Portovac drain. There was a significant reduction in the amount of bleeding through the Portovac drain and reduction in postoperative hemoglobin drop in patients who used tranexamic acid. There was neither significant difference in hemoglobin drop between groups 1 and 2, nor was there a need for hemotransfusion. Two patients in group 3 required blood transfusion. The findings demonstrated that the use of intravenous tranexamic acid in total hip arthroplasty reduced postoperative bleeding rates and significantly reduced serum hemoglobin without increasing thromboembolic effects. The bolus and bolus + infusion pump methods were shown to have a similar influence on hemoglobin and need for blood transfusion.
