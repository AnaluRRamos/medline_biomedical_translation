This article set out to reflect on the setting up of psychosocial care networks based on the trajectory of a city in the greater S達o Paulo area. With that objective in mind, an exploratory study of the Unified Health System (SUS) and Mental Health in S達o Paulo between 1980 and 2013 was conducted. Official documents and articles, dissertations, theses and books concerning the implementation of the SUS in the city of S達o Paulo, with an emphasis on the mental health network, were analyzed. Open interviews with actors who lived through this moment in history were also conducted. In this manner, it was possible to highlight six important landmarks in this trajectory: the asylum-care model; the 1980s - advances and setbacks; 1989 to 1992 - the comprehensive care model for mental health; 1993 to 2000 - political setbacks and resistance; the 'Qualis II' Project; the municipalization of healthcare. Based on the analytical literature, the importance of historical events to understand the political proposals and the consolidation of public policies related to the SUS in S達o Paulo was revealed.
