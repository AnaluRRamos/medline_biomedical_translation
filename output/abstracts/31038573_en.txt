In Rio Grande do Sul Sate (Brazil), the incidence of congenital anomalies ranges from 10 to 15/1,000 live births. Identifying risk factors can change congenital anomalies frequency and neonatal mortality. This paper intends to analyze temporal variation of congenital anomalies in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, from 2005 to 2014, and to identify the factors associated with its occurrence. This is a descriptive, time series study based on secondary data on congenital anomalies and sociodemographic and health variables of mothers and newborns living in Rio Grande do Sul, from 2005 to 2014. In the period surveyed, there were 1,386,803 births of mothers living in Rio Grande do Sul, and the cases diagnosed with congenital anomalies corresponded to a general average rate of 9.2 per thousand cases, with a greater rate in the group of mothers of newborns whose Apgar score was lower than seven; who had a weight equal to or lower than 1,500 grams; with a gestational age equal to or lower than 31 weeks and living in the metropolitan region. The most frequent types of congenital anomalies were those located in the musculoskeletal system, the nervous system and the circulatory system. These data warn us about the change in the epidemiological profile of mothers of children with congenital anomalies, thereby indicating the groups at greatest risk.
