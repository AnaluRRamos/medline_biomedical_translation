Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus is a multifactorial syndrome with severe complications. Oxidative stress is accepted as a causal factor of chronic complications. To demonstrate alterations in oxidative stress after metabolic surgery. Twenty-four 2-day-old Wistar rats were used. In 16, Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus was induced by 100 mg/kg streptozotocin injection. The development of diabetes was confirmed after 10 weeks using an oral glucose tolerance test. Eight diabetic rats composed the diabetic surgical group; the remaining eight composed the diabetic group. Eight animals in which diabetes was not induced formed the clinical control group. The Marchesini technique was used in the diabetic surgical group. After 90 days, the rats were sacrificed, and the oxidative stress markers were measured. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, superoxide dismutase and catalase were significantly reduced in the diabetic surgical group compared to the diabetic group. The duodenojejunostomy was effective in controlling the exacerbated oxidative stress present in diabetic rats.
