To compare radiographic and surgical outcomes of Lenke 1B and 1C patterns. One hundred twenty patients with Lenke 1B and 1C scoliosis were grouped according to implant density as follows: low density (LD) of ≤1.4 and high density (HD) of >1.4. Matched subgroups (30 patients each) based on age, curve magnitude, and body mass index (BMI) were analyzed. Radiographic parameters were evaluated before operation, immediately after operation (ipo), and at 2 years' follow-up. SRS-30 was administered before operation and at 2 years' follow-up. The major curves of the LD (n = 82) and HD groups (n=38) were respectively 59.1° and 65.6° before operation (p <.001), 26.3° and 22.9° ipo (p =.05), and 29.9° and 19.8° at 2 years' follow-up (p <.001). No significant differences in postoperative trunk shift and coronal balance were found (p =.69 and p =.74, respectively). The HD group had higher blood loss (p =.02), number of implants (p <.001), levels fused (p =.002), and surgical time (p <.001). The HD group had a higher prevalence of hypokyphosis from before operation to follow-up (p <.001). No significant differences were observed in the SRS-30 scores before operation and at 2 years' follow-up. The matched groups had similar preoperative major curves (p =.56), ages (p =.75), and BMIs (p =.61). Significantly longer surgical time (p =.009), higher density (p <.001), and better correction (p =.0001) were found in the HD group at 2 years' follow-up. No significant differences were found in the SRS-30 scores before operation and at 2 years' follow-up. LD constructs included fewer segments fused, lower intraoperative estimated surgical blood loss, and shorter operation time, and potentially decreasing complication risks due to fewer implants. <b><i>Level of evidence III, Retrospective Cohort Study</i>.</b>
