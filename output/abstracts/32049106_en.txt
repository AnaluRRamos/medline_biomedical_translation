To verify and compare the immediate effects of the voiced oral high-frequency oscillation (VOHFO) technique and the phonation into a silicone resonance tube in the elderly self-perception of vocal and laryngeal symptoms and in their voice quality. 14 elderly women, over 60 years old, performed the VOHFO and phonation into a resonance tube technique (35cm in length and 9mm in diameter) with one-week interval between both to avoid carry-over effect. Initially, all participants answered questions regarding the frequency and intensity of their vocal/laryngeal symptoms. Recordings of the sustained vowel /a/ and counting numbers were performed for posterior perceptual and acoustic analyses of the voice quality. The maximum phonation time (MPT) for /a/, /s/, /z/ and counting numbers were also obtained. After that, a draw lot established which technique (VOHFO or resonance tube) would be initially applied for three minutes. After the exercise performance the same procedures were carried out and the elderly women answered a self-assessment questionnaire about the effect of the techniques in her voice, larynx, breathing and articulation. Comparison pre and post each technique were analyzed using ANOVA, Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney tests. The sensations after the techniques were assessed using the Chi-square test (p<0.05). The comparison of both techniques showed decrease in roughness and improvement in resonance for counting numbers after the resonance tube and same outcomes post VOHFO. There were no significant differences for the other analyzed variables between groups. The phonation into a resonance tube exercise improves the vocal quality of elderly women. In addition, both exercises are similar regarding self-perception of vocal / laryngeal symptoms and sensations post three minutes of the technique, suggesting that VOHFO can be safely applied in voice therapy for this population.
