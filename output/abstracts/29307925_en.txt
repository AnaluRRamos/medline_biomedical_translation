To assess the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) patterns associated with central nervous system infection with <i>Cryptococcus</i> sp. in relation to patient immune status. This was a retrospective study of MRI data for 19 patients with neurocryptococcosis who underwent the examination between January 2000 and March 2014. The MRI characteristics examined included lesion topography, aspects of diffusion, T1-weighted images, T2-weighted images, and contrast enhancement patterns. In all cases, cryptococcal infection was confirmed by cerebrospinal fluid analysis. Of the 19 patients, 10 were immunocompromised and 9 were immunocompetent. Abnormal imaging patterns occurred alone or in conjunction with other manifestations. The imaging patterns found in immunocompromised patients included the following: leptomeningeal enhancement, in 6; pachymeningeal enhancement, in 3 (due to intracranial hypotension in 2); perivascular space involvement, in 4; granulomas, in 2; hydrocephalus, in 2; miliary nodules, in 1; and plexitis, in 1. In immunocompetent patients, the following imaging patterns were observed: leptomeningeal enhancement, in 5; perivascular space involvement, in 3; granulomas, in 3; cryptococcoma, in 1; ventriculitis, in 1; and hydrocephalus, in 1. In 2 immunocompetent patients, diffusion-weighted imaging showed diffusion restriction in cerebral cryptococcal granuloma. In both groups, the most common imaging finding was leptomeningeal enhancement, followed by dilatation of perivascular spaces with the presence of mucoid material. Rare presentations, such as miliary nodules, plexitis, ventriculitis, and pachymeningeal enhancement, were also observed. None of the imaging patterns common to immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients differed significantly in frequency between them.
