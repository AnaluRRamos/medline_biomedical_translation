To describe the experience of pregnant women at an advanced age. This is a qualitative and descriptive study, which was conducted with 21 pregnant women aged 35 years older or over undergoing high-risk prenatal care, from December 2015 to April 2016. The data were collected by means of semi-structured interviews. The thematic analysis of the data followed the six steps proposed by Creswell. Six thematic categories have appeared: Ambivalence: from fear to happiness; The (un)planning and the divine; Family (re)organization: from support to non-acceptance; Maturity as a facilitator for motherhood; Advanced age and risk perception; The biological age of the body hindering pregnancy. This study describes the experience of pregnant women at an advanced age and unveils several experienced aspects that could be used as allowances for nursing care to women who become pregnant at an advanced age.
