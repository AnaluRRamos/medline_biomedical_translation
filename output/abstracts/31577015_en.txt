Weight gain in adult life may be responsible for chronic diseases, and follow-up of this may be a subsidy to avoid these diseases. The objective was to analyze the weight gain and associated factors in workers of a private hospital in the city of Rio de Janeiro. This is a retrospective cohort of 686 workers, who performed at least two occupational health exams (admission and periodic) between 2010 and 2015. The Kaplan-Meier method and the Cox proportional hazards regression model were used. The incidence of weight gain of hospital workers was 22 cases / 100 person-years. The weight gain in workers over 30 years old was 35% lower (p < 0.001) when compared to weight gain in those up to 30 years of age. Regarding schooling, the incidence rates of weight gain among workers at primary and secondary levels were higher, with a magnitude of up to 61%, compared to those at a higher level (p < 0.001); And in the closed sector it was 63% higher when compared to the open sector (p < 0.001). Weight gain is a multifaceted and complex phenomenon, being the work sectors of a hospital unit a strong causer of occurrences of the event.
