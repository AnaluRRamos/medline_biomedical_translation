Uric acid (UA), the end product of purine nucleotide metabolism, participates in the processes of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. Experimental evidence suggests it is an important mediator in the physiological response to blood pressure increase. To evaluate the association between serum UA levels and pre-hypertension and hypertension in a Chinese population. A cross-sectional study was conducted from March to September 2017, and 1,138 participants aged 35 to 75 were enrolled in this study, where 223 normotensive, 316 pre-hypertensive, and 599 hypertensive subjects were selected to evaluate the association between serum UA levels and hypertension. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Serum UA levels were significantly higher in the pre-hypertension and hypertension group compared to the control group in the entire population (p<0.05 for all). Quantitative trait analysis indicated that serum UA levels were (2.92±0.81, 3.06±0.85, 3.22±0.98 mg/d) linearly increased in normotensive, pre-hypertensive and hypertensive females, with a p value of 0.008. Serum UA levels in the quartiles were positively correlated with DBP (p<0.05), particularly in females. After adjusting for age, gender, body mass index (BMI), glucose (GLU), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of pre-hypertension from the lowest (referent) to the highest levels of serum UA were 1.718 (1.028–2.872), 1.018 (0.627–1.654) and 1.738 (1.003–3.010). Additionally, the second quartile of serum UA levels were significantly associated with hypertension, with an OR (95% CI) of 2.036 (1.256–3.298). This study suggests that higher serum UA levels are positively associated with pre-hypertension and hypertension among Chinese adults.
