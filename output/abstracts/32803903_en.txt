Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is important in B-cell signalling. Efficacy has been reported for BTK inhibitors (BTKi) in human autoimmune diseases. Canine pemphigus foliaceus (cPF) is one of the most common canine autoimmune skin diseases. To determine the safety and efficacy of the BTKi PRN1008 in the treatment of cPF. Four privately owned dogs. Four dogs diagnosed with PF were administered BTKi PRN1008. Initial dosages approximated to 15 mg/kg once daily, increased to twice daily if inadequate response was seen. Treatment continued for 20 weeks, attempting to decrease to every other day. Dogs were monitored with complete blood counts, serum biochemistry panels and urinalyses, and evaluated with a modified version of a validated human Pemphigus Disease Activity Index (cPDAI). Serum anti-desmocollin-1 (DSC-1) and desmoglein-1 (DSG-1) immunoglobulin (Ig)G titres were performed before and after the treatment period. Drug bound to target was measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). All four dogs showed reduction in lesions and cPDAI score during the first two weeks of treatment. Three dogs continued to improve and sustained near complete remission by 20 weeks, at which point three responses were considered 'good' and one 'fair'. Final daily dosages were in the range 17-33 mg/kg. Anti-DSC-1 IgG titre decreased dramatically in one dog, was undetectable in two and was uninterpretable in one dog. No dogs had detectable IgG to DSG1. A possible adverse event occurred in one dog. BTKi PRN1008 monotherapy may have some beneficial effects in some cases of cPF.
