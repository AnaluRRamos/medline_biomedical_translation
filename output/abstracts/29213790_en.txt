Cerebrovascular disease (CVD) is often present in old age and may be associated with microstructural pathology of white matter (WM) and cognitive dysfunction. The current review investigated the relationship between CVD, cognitive status and WM integrity as assessed by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). DTI studies were searched on ISI and Pubmed databases from 2002 to 2012. Studies evidenced DTI changes in WM as associated with vascular disease and provide increasing support for DTI as a valuable method for early detection of CVD. DTI parameters can serve as important biomarkers in monitoring vascular disease progression and treatment response and may represent a surrogate marker of WM tract integrity.
