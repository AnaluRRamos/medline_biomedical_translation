We sought to analyze the processes of formulation, updating and implementation of the Brazilian National Food and Nutrition Policy (PNAN), from 1999 to April 2020. This is a discussion paper, using institutional documentary sources, bibliographic search in national and international databases, as well as theses and dissertations. The theory of the cycle of public policies was adopted to systematize and present the set of information. PNAN was established in 1999 and updated ten years later, in a participatory process, based on an innovative approach centered on the paradigms of healthy food practices, the human right to food and nutritional security, aligned with the Brazilian Unified National. Regarding implementation, there are advances related to the publication of Food Guides with national guidelines; to the promotion of research in food and nutrition; to collective action to build the regulatory agenda, even if with disputes, and to the decentralization of financial resources for the execution of PNAN actions. The monitoring and evaluation focused on the food and nutritional situation; we found that there were insufficient mechanisms to feed back the policy. After 20 years, PNAN maintains the challenge of effectively fulfilling its historic commitment: the universal guarantee of the human right to adequate and healthy food.
