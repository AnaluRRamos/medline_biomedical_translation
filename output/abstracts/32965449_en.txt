To identify general enterprising tendency and competence in interpersonal communication of nursing students and correlate them with personal and academic variables. A cross-sectional study at a university in São Paulo, SP, Brazil. Three instruments were used for data collection: 1 - A questionnaire with personal and academic variables; 2 - The General measure of Enterprising Tendency test (GET); and 3 - The Interpersonal Communication Competence Scale (Escala de Competência em Comunicação Interpessoal - ECCI). The sample consisted of 150 participants. The highest averages were on the GET 'Need for Achievement' dimension (M = 7.88; SD = 2.12 and median = 8.00) and the ECCI 'Availability' dimension (M = 12.50; SD = 1.99 and median = 13.00). Students in the less advanced periods of the course obtained higher averages on the GET 'Drive and Determination' dimension (p = 0.032), while those who performed paid work a higher average on the ECCI 'Interaction Management' dimension (p = 0.030). Higher Education Institutions should look for strategies to teach the content of these competencies in a more dynamic and engaging way throughout education which encompass the student's capacity and the needs of the labor market.
