To identify key methodological elements for prioritization in health research, based on the methodologies reported in the scientific literature. A systematic search was conducted in Medline, Embase, LILACS, and complementary sources of gray literature. Keywords research, methods and health priorities were used in combination with free terms. Two independent reviewers, according to previously defined criteria, selected literature reviews or methodological documents that presented methodologies for prioritization in health research. The main characteristics of the reported methodologies were extracted and common elements were identified. Seven revisions and five methodological documents were included, reporting four specific structured methodologies and multiple methodological approaches combining diverse elements. In general, these methodologies integrate the perspective of key stakeholders with objective information, through the application of standardized participation techniques, to establish a ranking of priorities based on previously defined criteria. Common methodological elements related to process steps, participation mechanisms, criteria for prioritizing and analysis of results were identified. The prioritization in health research requires the use of a methodology defined a priori, which must contain at least four key elements: clear steps of the process, criteria to prioritize, formal techniques of participation and methods for analysis of results. These elements should be tailored to the conditions and needs of the application context.
