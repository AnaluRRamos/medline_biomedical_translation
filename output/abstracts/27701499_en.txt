The success of any endodontic therapy depends on factors such as correct diagnosis and prognosis. Unawareness or failure to locate additional canals, such as the mesiopalatal canal in the upper first molar, may lead to unsuccessful treatment. Hence, it is valid to consider all the resources available for locating this anatomic structure, e.g. the Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT). The purpose of this study was to verify the frequency of mesiopalatal canals in upper first permanent molars through computed tomography. Tomography images from a digital archive of a diagnostic imaging center were analyzed. Eighty (80) upper right first molars were assessed through CBCT in axial cross sections at 6mm and 3mm from the root apex; 40 were females and 40, males, randomly chosen. The results revealed that the mesiopalatal canals were present in 56.25% of the sections at 6mm from the root apex, and in 23.75% at 3mm from the apical limit. CBCT scan has proved to be a valid resource for locating mesiopalatal canal, especially in cases where location was not feasible through clinical means.
