The purpose of present study was to analyze the magnitude of the effect-size in the assessment of the cognitive status of populations over 60 years of age. The search strategy included PubMed, B-on, Ebsco, Ebsco Health, Scielo, Eric, Lilacs and Sportdiscus data bases. Only observational, cohort and cross-sectional studies were included in the meta-analysis. The central descriptors were elderly-frail, older adults, cognition and geriatric assessment and other additional terms. After applying the additional search criteria, 12 manuscripts were selected from an initial universe of 1,078 identified. When comparing the mean cognitive profile scores of the participants of the pre-frail (n =11,265) and frail (n = 2,460) groups, significant statistical differences were found (p<0,001), with lower mean scores emerging in frail-group. The results showed that cognitive decline is strongly associated with frailty, being a probable main clinical outcome. In this sense, any strategy aimed at mitigating or reversing the incidence of frailty with ageing should take into account that physical and cognitive frailty seem to have similar temporal trajectories.
