The objective of this study was to determine the epidemiological characteristics of leptospirosis in pets and in humans in peridomestic settings in Nicaragua between 2014 and 2016. The samples were taken in areas where cases were confirmed in humans using non-probabilistic sampling in 10 of the country's 17 departments. This included 112 urine samples from pets, 129 water samples, and 69 soil samples in order to isolate leptospires in Ellinghausen-McCullough-Johnson-Harris (EMJH) medium. Furthermore, the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) was applied to 263 samples of animal serum, and 88 isolates were analyzed using PCR. In 32.6% (101/310) of the samples, spirochetes were isolated: 23.2% (26/112) in the pet urine, 47.3% (61/129) in water samples, and 20.3% (14/69) in soil samples. Isolation analysis showed significant differences (p<0.05) between departments for the different types of samples, and isolation was more frequent in water than in soil (OR = 3.49; CI95%: 1.56-7.80). In total, 14.1% (37/263) of the animals were reactors in the microscopic agglutination test. The most frequent serogroup was <i>Icterohaemorrhagiae</i> (40%). PCR analysis to identify pathogenic species of leptospires resulted in 10.2% (9/88) positive isolations. This research demonstrates that pets and environment conditions play an important role in the emergence of outbreaks of leptospirosis, and confirms the endemic behavior of the disease in Nicaragua.
