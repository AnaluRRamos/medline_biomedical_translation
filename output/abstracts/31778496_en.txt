Health equity, on the other hand, provides protection against the harmful effects of austerity on population health The aim of this article is to analyse the effect of the global financial crisis on how health equity is considered against effectiveness in international comparisons of health systems efficiency in the scientific literature. Integrative review, based on PubMed and VHL databases searches, 2008-18, and cross-case analysis. The balance between equity and effectiveness must be sought from health financing to results, in an efficient way, as a means to strengthening health systems.
