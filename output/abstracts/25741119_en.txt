To evaluate the mean glandular dose with a solid state detector and the image quality in a direct radiography system, utilizing phantoms. Irradiations were performed with automatic exposure control and polymethyl methacrylate slabs with different thicknesses to calculate glandular dose values. The image quality was evaluated by means of the structures visualized on the images of the phantoms. Considering the uncertainty of the measurements, the mean glandular dose results are in agreement with the values provided by the equipment and with internationally adopted reference levels. Results obtained from images of the phantoms were in agreement with the reference values. The present study contributes to verify the equipment conformity as regards dose values and image quality.
