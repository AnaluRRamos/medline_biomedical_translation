To analyze the perception of caregivers of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder regarding the functional profile of their children's communication in three moments, before and after the guidelines. Caregivers of 62 children diagnosed with ASD (AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER) participated in this study, divided into three groups of interventions. All interventions included a program with five pre-set monthly orientation sessions to provide information on the development of communication and encourage practical communication activities in daily life. In G1 (group 1), the caregivers received the group orientation program, and the children received individual speech therapy. In G2 (group 2), caregivers received the same program orientations but individually, and their children received different treatment. G3 (group 3), composed of caregivers of children waiting for speech-language pathology on the waiting list, received group guidance. All caregivers answered the Functional Communication Checklist (PFC-C) in three moments: baseline, five and eight months. In the PFC-C the parents reported an increase in the occurrence of gestural, vocal and verbal means in all groups, to express interpersonal communicative functions, except in G2. In non-interpersonal communicative functions, there was a decrease in the occurrence of the gestural communicative environment, an increase in the verbal climate, with no statistical difference between the groups. As for the vocal climate, there was no difference over time. Communication guidelines for caregivers of children with ASD (AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER) (Autism Spectrum Disorder) contributed to the understanding of the communicative process in different situations, by detecting differences in their perception of the communication functionality of their children.
