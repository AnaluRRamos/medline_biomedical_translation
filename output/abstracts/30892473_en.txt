To analyze the trends in hospitalization and mortality rates for ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSC) among older adults in the state of Santa Catarina, Brazil, from 2008 to 2015. Ecological time-series study based on data from the Hospital Information System (Sistema de Informações Hospitalares - SIH) of the public health system (Sistema Único de Saúde - SUS), using hospital admission authorization forms as data source, from 2008 to 2015, in Santa Catarina. Data were analyzed by gender and age, which was stratified into two age groups: 60 to 79 years and 80 years or older. We standardized age rates using the direct method and statistical analysis using segmented linear regression (joinpoint regression). Sensitive conditions led to 41% of total hospitalizations of older adults in 2008 and 32% in 2015. The annual rate variation decreased [-4.6^ 95%CI (-5.7; -3.6)]. The most prevalent causes were: heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cerebrovascular diseases. Hospitalization mortality rates dropped, regardless of gender and in the age group up to 80 years, representing an annual variation of -2.4%, with -2.1% for males and -2.7% for females. Analyzing the ACSC indicator, which evaluates the quality and effectiveness of primary care, the results of this research revealed a reduction in hospitalization rates among older adults, regardless of gender and age groups established in this study.
