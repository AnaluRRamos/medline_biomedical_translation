Hepatic lymphoma can be divided into its primary and secondary forms. To be classified as primary hepatic lymphoma, the disease should be limited to the liver and hilar lymph nodes, with no distant involvement (to the bone marrow or other sites). Primary hepatic lymphoma is quite rare, accounting for less than 1% of all cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, whereas secondary hepatic lymphoma affects nearly half of such cases. Familiarity with the imaging features of hepatic lymphoma is important for its early diagnosis and appropriate management. In this essay, we aim to review the roles of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging in identifying and monitoring hepatic lymphomas, using sample cases to describe and illustrate the wide spectrum of imaging findings in the primary and secondary forms of this disorder.
