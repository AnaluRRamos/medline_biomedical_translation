The prevalence of obesity and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) increases significantly in postmenopausal women. Although obesity is a risk factor for left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD), the mechanisms that link the cessation of ovarian hormone production, and particularly estrogens, to the development of obesity, LVDD, and HFpEF in aging females are unclear. Clinical, and epidemiologic studies show that postmenopausal women with abdominal obesity (defined by waist circumference) are at greater risk for developing HFpEF than men or women without abdominal obesity. The study presents a review of clinical data that support a mechanistic link between estrogen loss plus obesity and left ventricular remodeling with LVDD. It also seeks to discuss potential cell and molecular mechanisms for estrogen-mediated protection against adverse adipocyte cell types, tissue depots, function, and metabolism that may contribute to LVDD and HFpEF.
