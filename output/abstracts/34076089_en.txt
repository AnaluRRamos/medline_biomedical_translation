To identify factors associated with a higher probability of survival for men aged 60 and over in the course of almost 15 years. Prospective cohort study, where time zero is the year 2000 and deaths (final event) were measured until November 2014. The independent variables were obtained from personal characteristics, childhood life, educational status, lifestyle, social support, work history, socioeconomic situation, and health condition. At the end of the period, 25.8% of elderly men remained alive and the factors that stood out associated with a higher probability of survival were: performing 50% or more of the Basic and/or Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (95%CI 0.41 - 0.64), being the head of the family (95%CI 0.42 - 0.82), participating in the community (95%CI 0.52 - 0.88), working on their own (95%CI 0.54 - 0.88), and owning a home and goods (95%CI 0.56 - 0.92). Characteristics related to a greater autonomy of the elderly men, even after almost 15 years, contributed to an increase in the probability of survival.
