This study sought to investigate the relationship between domestic maltreatment and excess weight, body fat and abdominal fat among adolescents from the public schools in the city of Rio de Janeiro - Brazil. It involved a cross-sectional study using data from the Risk Factor Surveillance System and Protection of Health of Adolescents, held in 2007 by the municipality of Rio de Janeiro. The sample consisted of 1628 students aged 13 to 19 years, of both sexes, in the 9th year of school. Excess weight, body fat and abdominal fat (outcome variables) and domestic maltreatment (physical and verbal aggression) were evaluated. The association between domestic maltreatment and outcome variables was conducted via logistic regression models. Domestic maltreatment showed an inverse relationship to excess weight and fat for girls, but only physical aggression was significantly associated with excess weight (OR = 0.499, CI = 0.212 to 0.951). As for the boys, the results pointed to excess weight and fat but without statistical significance. Health policies must consider the differences between the genders in coping with experiences of violence that may influence the health and well-being of adolescents.
