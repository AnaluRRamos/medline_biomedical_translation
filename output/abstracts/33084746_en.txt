Sacubitril/valsartan had its prognosis benefit confirmed in the PARADIGM-HF trial. However, data on cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) changes with sacubitril-valsartan therapy are scarce. This study aimed to compare CPET parameters before and after sacubitril-valsartan therapy. Prospective evaluation of chronic heart failure (HF) patients with left ventricular ejection fraction ≤40% despite optimized standard of care therapy, who started sacubitril-valsartan therapy, expecting no additional HF treatment. CPET data were gathered in the week before and 6 months after sacubitril-valsartan therapy. Statistical differences with a p-value <0.05 were considered significant. Out of 42 patients, 35 (83.3%) completed the 6-month follow-up, since 2 (4.8%) patients died and 5 (11.9%) discontinued treatment for adverse events. Mean age was 58.6±11.1 years. New York Heart Association class improved in 26 (74.3%) patients. Maximal oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2</sub>max) (14.4 vs. 18.3 ml/kg/min, p<0.001), VE/VCO<sub>2</sub>slope (36.7 vs. 31.1, p<0.001), and exercise duration (487.8 vs. 640.3 sec, p<0.001) also improved with sacubitril-valsartan. Benefit was maintained even with the 24/26 mg dose (13.5 vs. 19.2 ml/kg/min, p=0.018) of sacubitril-valsartan, as long as this was the highest tolerated dose. Sacubitril-valsartan therapy is associated with marked CPET improvement in VO<sub>2</sub>max, VE/VCO<sub>2</sub>slope, and exercise duration. (Arq Bras Cardiol. 2020; [online].ahead print, PP.0-0)
