The aim of the present study was to perform a literature review about the symptoms, treatment and prevention of varicose veins (VV) within the occupational medicine setting. I reviewed scientific articles, books, master's and doctoral dissertations and synthesized the results of quantitative and qualitative studies. I further retrieved information from Brazilian federal government occupational health websites. The time frame considered was the period from 2004 through 2018. VV are abnormally dilated, twisted and congested veins caused by prolonged peripheral venous hypertension and chronic venous insufficiency. VV most commonly involve the lower limbs in association with static posture and continuous contraction which exhaust the muscles, especially among individuals who remain standing over long periods of time. VV are associated with risk factors such as obesity, sedentary lifestyle and hormones. Symptoms include feelings of tiredness, pain and swelling. When untreated VV might result in venous ulcers. Occupational physicians should promote changes in the workers' lifestyle, particularly as concerns physical activity (stretching and walking), local massage and elevating the lower limbs - feet about 15 cm above the heart level, and prescribe compression stockings or bandages, and medications such as diosmin, calcium dobesilate, rutosides and horse chestnut extract.
