Tibia shaft fractures are among the most common in orthopedic practice, but Brazilian literature remains limited on the subject. To evaluate the characteristics of tibia shaft fractures and conduct a comparison between exposed and closed fractures of the tibia. This comparative prospective study examined all tibia shaft fractures admitted to our services over a twelve-month period. The cases were evaluated according to age, trauma mechanism, sex, associated fractures, treatment, hospital stay, and readmission rate during the six months after discharge. Fifty-three cases met the inclusion criteria. The average age was 36 years (SD 14.3) and 83% were males (p<0.001). Traffic accidents were responsible for 73.6% of fractures (p<0.001). Exposed fractures were found in 52.8% of the cases (p=0.56). When initial treatment consisted of stabilization with external fixation, these cases were more likely to be rehospitalized (p=0.009). Cases of open fracture also had longer hospital stays (p<0.001) and a higher readmission rate (p=0.028). Open fractures are associated with more severe trauma, expressed in longer hospital stays and high rates of readmission. Cases of fracture which were initially treated with external fixation had a higher readmission rate. <i><b>Level of Evidence II; Prospective comparative study.</b></i>
