The objective of this integrative revision is to understand the Brazilian scientific production of the thematic focus on the family quality of life (FQoL) of people with disabilities, as well as the participating population, referential theory, and instruments used in the studies. The data survey was done in the BVS, Scielo, and PubMed databases, and in the Capes' Periodic portal, whose inclusion criteria were articles published from 2007 to 2018, available fully online, in Portuguese or English. These articles portrayed the theme of life quality of families of people with disabilities and articles from research done in Brazilian contexts. The results showed that only three of the 19 selected articles to the study analyzed the theme of FQoL directly including the aspects related to the construct. They also pointed out that WHOQOL-Bref was the most used instrument to evaluate the FQoL (n=11), followed by semi structured interviews (n=5) and that only 10,5%, i.e., two articles used the appropriated definition of the FQoL. The research determined that the thematic research is still in the beginning stage in the scientific national production, large use of individual constructs of life quality, and sparse presence of specific measures instruments to measure FQoL.
