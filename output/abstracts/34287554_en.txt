Thirty-five percent of the teams presented adequate organization and 88% requested all tests. Among the users, 31% had their feet examined and 18% received adequate health care. Municipalities in the Southeast region, with more than 300,000 inhabitants and the highest human development index, presented the best indicators. The teams that took part in both cycles I and II showed greater prevalence of organization and request for tests.
