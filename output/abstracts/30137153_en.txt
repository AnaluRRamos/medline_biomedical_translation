To investigate the socioeconomic, demographic and cultural elements that interfere in the adherence to the use of condoms in an open population. A cross-sectional study with a quantitative approach was conducted through an explanatory household survey, in the municipality of Cara√∫bas, West Potiguar mesoregion, with 3 482 individuals older than 18. A Likert questionnaire was administered by community health agents in a household setting. Descriptive statistics were performed, followed by univariate and bivariate analyzes, using the Chi-square test. The most receptive groups to condom use are the earliest age groups, male subjects, participants who do not have a stable relationship, and those with a higher education level. The association between condom and condom use showed that the more affluent strata represented less condom adoption. The reasons for condom abandonment were the preference for another contraceptive method and the confidence in the partner, and the main reason for its use was prevention against sexually transmitted diseases. Adherence to condom use is scarce in all the groups considered. The popularization of the method must be fostered by individual and collective measures directed to consider the use of condoms for a dual purpose, by expanding information through sex education campaigns and overcoming gender conflicts.
