To describe the clinical-epidemiological profile of patients with orofacial fissures treated at a reference center from northeast Brazil. Descriptive study, based on secondary data obtained from medical records. Sociodemographic information of patients and their mothers, use of medication during pregnancy, clinical and surgical aspects related to fissures, family history of malformation, and consanguinity among the parents were investigated. Data were analyzed descriptively using the SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) statistical program to obtain frequency, mean and standard deviation measures. 51.1% of the patients with orofacial fissures were female, 46.2% were under one year of age and 54.4% lived in urban areas. The majority of mothers were between the ages of 16 and 25 during the gestational period, and 59.2% reported the use of medication. Cleft lip and palate were the most prevalent types of fissures (34.4%). On admission to the Craniofacial Anomaly Rehabilitation Center, 90.5% of the individuals had not yet undergone surgical treatment. Family history of fissure was found in 29.8% of the cases studied, but inbreeding among parents was reported in only 7.1% of them. Socioeconomic and genetic factors can influence the development of orofacial fissures; this requires greater governmental attention as well as new studies for better investigation.
