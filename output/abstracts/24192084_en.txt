In the present article we evaluate and comment the systematic review from Cochrane Collaboration 'Effect of longer-term modest salt reduction on blood pressure. Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2013 Apr 30;4:CD004937'. What is the impact of long-term (= 4 weeks) modest salt (sodium chloride) reduction on arterial blood pressure? This systematic review concluded that a moderate reduction in salt intake (mean reduction -4.4 g per day) resulted in statistically significant decreases in blood pressure (BP) that may be helpful in normotensive (-2.42 mmHg systolic BP; -1.00 mmHg diastolic BP) and hypertensive patients (-5.39 mmHg systolic BP; -2.82 mmHg diastolic BP). There were slight increases in physiological plasma renin activity, aldosterone and norepinephrine, without significant changes in lipid profile.
