To evaluate the accuracy of percutaneous transhepatic biliary biopsy (PTBB) in patients with suspected biliary obstruction. This was a retrospective analysis of 18 patients with obstructive jaundice who underwent PTBB. In each patient, three to ten fragments were collected from the lesion. The final diagnosis was confirmed in the pathology report. We also reviewed analyses of the results of laboratory tests performed before the procedure, as well as the Bismuth classification, clinical outcome, complications occurring during the procedure, access route, and materials used. Technical success was achieved in 100% of the PTBB procedures. Among the 18 patients clinically diagnosed with bile duct stenosis, the pathological analysis confirmed that diagnosis in 17. In one case, the pathological findings were considered false-negative. The predominant tumor was cholangiocarcinoma (seen in 50% of the cases). Sixteen of the procedures (88.9%) were performed without complications. Transient hemobilia occurred in one case, and cholangitis occurred in another. PTBB is a safe, viable, simple technique with a high rate of true-positive results for the definitive diagnosis of obstructive jaundice.
