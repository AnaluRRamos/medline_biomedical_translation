This paper aims to identify the factors associated with high salt intake in the Brazilian adult population. This is a cross-sectional study with 8,083 adults participating in the National Health Survey (PNS, 2014/15). Salt intake was based on the estimation of 24-hour urinary sodium calculated from the sodium/creatinine ratio in spot urine samples. The highest quartile of the distribution was considered high salt intake. The relationship between high salt consumption and sociodemographic factors, lifestyles, morbidity, and self-rated health status was analyzed by calculating the crude prevalence ratios and the prevalence ratios adjusted for age and gender. Approximately 28.1% had an estimated salt intake higher than 10.56 g/day. Overweight (Adjusted Prevalence Ratio; 95%CI - PRadj 1.23; 1.09-1.39), obesity (PRadj 1.61; 1.43-1.83), and diabetes (PRadj 1.36; 1.17-1.58) were positively associated with high salt intake. Female gender (PRadj 0.73; 0.66-0.80), high schooling level (PRadj 0.88; 0.79-0.99), living in the North and chronic kidney disease (PRadj 0.71; 0.56-0.90) were protective factors. Salt consumption is elevated nationwide and in all population subgroups, requiring coordinated actions.
