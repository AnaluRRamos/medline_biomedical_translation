Dementia studies has primarily focused on disorders of the cerebral cortex and subcortical gray matter, what originated the concepts of cortical and subcortical dementias respectively. Dementia related mainly with cerebral white matter have received less attention. We present five different cases, each one illustrative of a dementia subtype that could be assigned under the category of 'white matter dementia': CADASIL, progressive subcortical gliosis, progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy, normopressure hydrocephalus and brain injury. Besides that, recent clinical and scientific literature on white matter dementia was reviewed. The composition of exuberant psychiatric symptoms and personality changes (mainly apathy, but also desinhibition) with neurological signs (pyramidal alone or associated with extrapyramidal signs, ataxia and urinary incontinence) and with specific cognitive impairment (mentioned above), should rise strongly the possibility of a white-matter dementia, instead of a cortical or subcortical form of dementia.
