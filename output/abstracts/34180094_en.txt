Feline atopic skin syndrome (FASS) is a pruritic and inflammatory skin disease commonly encountered in cats. Three previous reports evaluated cytokine immune activation in cats diagnosed with feline allergic dermatitis. However, no significant upregulations were observed in allergic cats compared to healthy controls. To evaluate differences in the serum cytokine profile of cats diagnosed with FASS compared to healthy cats, and correlate serum markers with the extent of FASS skin disease using clinical scoring systems. Thirteen client-owned FASS cats and 12 healthy control cats. Thirteen cytokine and chemokines from the serum of FASS cats and healthy controls were analysed using a commercially available feline-specific multiplex assay. Patients with FASS had a significant increase in serum concentrations of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin (IL)-2, IL-13 and IL-18. In addition, cytokine/chemokines involved in inflammation and chemotaxis [IL-8, C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand (CCL)5, CCL2 and CXCL12], as well as growth factors, stem cell factor and Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L), also were significantly elevated. A significant positive correlation (r = 0.64) between the serum levels of Flt3L and Scoring Feline Allergic Dermatitis (SCORFAD) score was observed. These results demonstrate the activation of a broad array of immune secretory cytokines in the serum of cats with FASS, which are largely associated with a mixed Th1 and Th2 inflammatory response along with specific growth factors. Further larger-sample studies are needed to assess the modulation of serum biomarkers in FASS by pharmacological/therapeutic interventions.
