The integration of occupational risk management initiatives and health promotion and well-being in the workplace poses a challenge to organizations from different sectors. Cross-cultural adaptation of the <i>Dimensions of Corporate Well-Being Scorecard</i> (DCWS) to the Brazilian Portuguese language. The process of cross-cultural adaptation of the <i>Dimensions of Corporate Well-Being Scorecard</i> to the Brazilian Portuguese language evolved along six steps: translation, reconciliation, back-translation, revision by internal expert committee, revision by expert panel (pretest) and final revision. The stringent protocols adopted in the present study resulted in a satisfactory and adequate instrument to analyze programs which target workers' health, safety and well-being at organizations operating in Brazil. The Brazilian version of DCWS, entitled <i>Questionário sobre as Dimensões do Bem-Estar Corporativo</i> (QDBC) represents an advance in the evaluation of the effectiveness of integrated actions for health promotion and workers' well-being in different work environments.
