To analyze a body composition profile in women with class III obesity using the multipolar bioimpedance method. Thirteen sedentary women aged between 20 and 40 years were evaluated. The results show that the patients had a fat percentage of 51.9±1.50 % and lean mass of 48.1±1.50 %. Regarding fat mass and lean mass per body region, figures of 26.3±3.62kg and 26.2±2.91kg in the upper body, 9.1±0.06kg and 8.4±0.14kg in the lower limbs, and 3.3±0.02kg and 7.6±0.01kg in the upper limbs were obtained. Patients had a good symmetry between the left and right sides in both upper and lower limbs, besides of a muscular mass of 32.1±5.08kg, with a muscular mass index of 12.7±1.05kg/m2. Higher fat accumulation was observed in the upper body region, followed by lower and upper limbs. Total muscular mass was apparently preserved, although sarcopenic obesity was not verified. Since this is a group of people that is still understudied, there is a need for further research on genetic and physical profile and caloric expenditure during exercise and rest.
