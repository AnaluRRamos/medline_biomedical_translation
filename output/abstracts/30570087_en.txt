To evaluate the effectiveness of auricular acupuncture in the pain of cancer patients receiving chemotherapy and to verify if there were alterations in the use of analgesics after the application of this intervention. Randomized controlled trial with cancer patients with complaints of pain greater than or equal to four in the Numerical Pain Scale. Two parallel groups were created, an Experimental group, which received auricular acupuncture at energy balance points and at points indicated for the treatment of pain, and a Placebo group, in which fixed placebo points were used. Both groups received the application of semipermanent needles in eight sessions. 31 cancer patients participated in the study. After the eight auricular acupuncture sessions, there was a significant difference between the groups regarding the reduction of pain intensity (p < 0.001) and of the use of medications (p < 0.05). Auricular acupuncture was effective in reducing the pain of patients receiving chemotherapy. Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials: RBR-6k3rqh.
