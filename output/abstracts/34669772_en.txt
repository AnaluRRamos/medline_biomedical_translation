The objective was to demonstrate the rate of detection of mental disorders in primary healthcare units as a marker of access and indicator of care in mental health. A comparative case study was performed in the electronic patient files of adults seen in two neighboring primary care units in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 2015-2016 and 2016-2017. Diagnoses of mental disorders were extracted, using the International Classification of Diseases, dividing them into three groups: common mental disorders (CMD: F32; F33 F40-45, except F42, and R45), severe mental disorders (SMD: F20-F29; F31-F39), and alcohol and drug use (AD: F10-F19 and Z72). The results were compared to the community prevalence of mental disorders reported in the literature. Statistical analysis was applied with the chi-square test, in addition to a qualitative analysis of each unitÂ´s scenario. Unit A (2015-2016) showed a low detection rate for all disorders [SMD = 45 (0.8%); CMD = 148 (2.64%) and AD = 0]; unit B detected about 50% of the expected cases [SMD = 23 (0.98%); CMD = 140 (5.97%) and AD = 130 (5.54%)]. In 2016-2017 there was an increase in the overall detection of mental disorders at unit A [SMD = 89 (1.6%); CMD = 298 (5.24%) and AD = 7 (0.12%)], in unit B the detection rate remained similar [SMD = 25 (1.0%); CMD = 176 (7.14%) and AD = 121 (4.9%)]. Changes in the units were detected. Distinction in the detection rate was used as an indicator for analysis of mental health care, allowing the study of factors potentially associated with this variation, influencing access to care. Monitoring this indicator helps improve mental health care.
