Dyslipidemia occurs in approximately 70% of all liver transplant (LT) recipients, and no prior control studies have demonstrated any dietary intervention to change it. To analyze the effects of a dietary intervention on the lipid profile of dyslipidemic LT recipients. All LT recipients with dyslipidemia on clinical follow-up were enrolled. Anthropometric evaluation, food history, body composition (bioimpedance) and assessment of basal metabolism through indirect calorimetry were performed. Patients met with a dietitian and an individualized diet based on estimate of basal metabolism and consisting of 25% of the total energy value in total fat and <200 mg/day of cholesterol was prescribed. Total cholesterol (TC), HDL-cholesterol (HDL), LDL-cholesterol (LDL), triglycerides (TG) and anthropometric measures were measured at baseline and six months after intervention. Fifty-thee out of 56 patients concluded follow-up; age was 59±10 years; 29 were men (51.8%). The analysis pre- and post-intervention were, respectively: TC 238.9±30 and 165.1±35, p<0.001; LDL 154±33 and 90±29, p<0.001; and TG 168 (IQR=51-200) and 137 (IQR=94-177), p=<0.001. They were all modified at six months following intervention. At baseline, none of the patients had normal TC, and only 12 (22.7%) had optimal/near optimal LDL. Following dietary intervention, 45 patients (84.9%) reached normal TC and 50 (94.4%) had optimal/near optimal LDL. HDL and anthropometric measures were not modified. Dietary counseling with prescription of individualized diet based on estimate of basal metabolism through indirect calorimetry was able to manage dyslipidemia in most LT recipients; so, all dyslipidemic LT recipients must be enrolled on a dietary program.
