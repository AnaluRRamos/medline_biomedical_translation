This study aimed to reveal how metalworkers experience prolonged incapacity for work due to repetitive strain injury/work-related musculoskeletal disorder (RSI/WRMD) and the impact of chronic illness on the construction/deconstruction of masculinity. A qualitative study was performed, based on narrative interviews with male metalworkers in an automotive factory in the State of Bahia, Brazil. The results showed how the conflict in the experience of illness, the maintenance of male identity, and expectations of meeting the rules dictated by hegemonic masculinity are experienced and signified in daily life. Metalworkers' experience of illness with RSI/WRMD is expressed in their incapacity for work, deconstruction of self-esteem, loss of collective identity, and interruption of future prospects. In conclusion, hegemonic masculinity exposes men to more health risks, plays a mediating role in work-related illness, alters trajectories of care, and explains men's unwillingness to seek help.
