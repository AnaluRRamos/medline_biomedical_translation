To examine women with pelvic floor dysfunction (PFDs) and identify factors associated with sexual activity (SA) status that impacts quality of life (QoL).  We conducted a cross-sectional study that included women > 18 years old who presented with at least one PFD symptom (urinary incontinence [UI] and/or pelvic organ prolapse [POP]), in outpatient clinics specializing in urogynecology and PFD in Fortaleza, state of Ceará, Brazil, using a service evaluation form and QoL questionnaires.  The analysis of 659 women with PFD included 286 SA (43.4%) women and 373 non-sexually active (NSA) (56.6%) women, with a mean age of 54.7 (±12) years old. The results revealed that age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-1.12) and post-menopausal status (OR = 2.28, 95% CI 1.08-4.8) were negatively associated with SA. Being married (OR = 0.43, 95% CI 0.21-0.88) was associated with SA. Pelvic organ prolapse (OR = 1.16, 95% CI 0.81-1.68) and UI (OR = 0.17, 95% CI 0.08-0.36) did not prevent SA. SF-36 Health Survey results indicated that only the domain functional capacity was significantly worse in NSA women (<i>p</i> = 0.012). Two King's Health Questionnaire domains in NSA women, impact of UI (<i>p</i> = 0.005) and personal relationships (<i>p</i> < 0.001), were significantly associated factors. Data from the Prolapse Quality-of-life Questionnaire indicated that NSA women exhibited compromised QoL.  Postmenopausal status and age negatively affected SA. Being married facilitated SA. Presence of POP and UI did not affect SA. However, NSA women with POP exhibited compromised QoL.
