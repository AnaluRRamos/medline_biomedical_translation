Characterize the patterns in the occurrence of disasters, associated deaths, population affected, and economic damages in Mexico over the period 1900-2016. In a descriptive study approach, information was gathered on the frequency of disasters, associated deaths, persons affected, and economic damages in Mexico over the period indicated, using the International Disaster Database (EM-DAT) of the Center for Disaster Epidemiology Research (CRED) of the School of Public Health, Catholic University of Louvain, Belgium. In Mexico, an increase was observed in the frequency of disasters starting in the 1990s. According to the pattern of occurrence, the highest percentage were of hydrometeorological origin (storms, extreme temperatures, floods, avalanches, and storm surges), which accounted for half the reported disasters. In the series analyzed, disasters of hydrologic, meteorological, or climatological origin represented between 50% and 60% of the events and were the ones that caused the greatest damage. Geophysical events caused the most deaths, followed by hydrologic and then by meteorological events. The cost of damages increased with each decade. Of the 219 disasters analyzed over the period, 63.4% have occurred since 1990. The frequency of the disasters and the need for investment in their prevention and mitigation are increasing.
