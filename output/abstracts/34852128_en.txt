To evaluate the repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic on procedures performed by a public urgent dental care service (PUDS). This was a cross-sectional study, using data from the PUDS in Piracicaba, SP, Brazil, prior to the pandemic (February-March 2020) and during the pandemic (March-April 2020). Differences in the care profile between the pre-COVID-19 period and the COVID-19 period, according to sex, age and dental procedures were analyzed using Pearson's Chi-square test. Effect size was also measured using Cramer's V. There was a 51% reduction in the number of visits between the pre-COVID-19 period (n=824) and the COVID-19 period (n=404). The percentage of extractions reduced from 14.7% to 8.9%, while the percentage of temporary cavity fillings increased from 22.9% to 33.2%, between the two periods. The COVID-19 pandemic had repercussions on the amount and pattern of procedures performed at the city's urgent dental care service.
