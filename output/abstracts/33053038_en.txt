Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is used as extracirculatory support for the care of patients with severe and reversible cardiac and/or respiratory failure. Neurological complications may be related to the procedure. Given the unfavorable neurological evolution and the need to perform a brain death protocol, the performance of an apnea test in this context remains a challenge. We report the use of an apnea test for the diagnosis of brain death post-cardiac surgery in a patient receiving venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
