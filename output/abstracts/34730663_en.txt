This article aims to evaluate the conformity between drug package inserts (DPIs) and evidence-based bibliographic sources regarding the presence of contraindications to the use of contraceptives and anti-infective agents during breastfeeding. Contraceptive and anti-infectives were selected, according to ATC, with the updated record in the ANVISA and present in the bibliographic sources Breastfeeding and Use of Medicines and Other Substances, Medications and Mother's Milk, LactMed®, Micromedex® and UpToDate®. Information was extracted from the DPI 'Contraindications' and 'Warnings and precautions' sections and compared with the information in the bibliographic sources. The contraindication of the drug during breastfeeding was evaluated. Contraindications were found in the DPIs of five (55.5%) of the nine contraceptives. The contraindication percentage ranged from 0 to 55.5% among the bibliographic sources, depending on the source. The percentage was 46.3% in the DPIs, ranging from 0 to 12.9% in the bibliographic sources for anti-infectives. There is an agreement between the DPIs and the bibliographic sources regarding contraceptives; regarding anti-infectives, the DPIs are more often contraindicated for use during breastfeeding.
