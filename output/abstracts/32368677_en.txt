One of the causes of foodborne diseases is contamination during food preparation; food handlers carrying pathogens might be involved in the origin of this condition. This problem is more serious in health care facilities, since consumers of contaminated food are already ill. Therefore, operational procedures should be formulated to prevent incidents. We performed a review of scientific studies, legislation and regulations on this subject. The results indicate that the main causes of food contamination involving food handlers to be considered in strategies to reduce, or even eliminate foodborne diseases include: flaws in hand hygiene, intestinal parasites, lack of knowledge of good manufacturing practices (GMP) and of the etiologic agents of foodborne diseases, and lack of GMP monitoring. We conclude that standardized operational procedures should be developed, including clear and objective flowcharts (suggested here) to be managed by the safety and occupational medicine staff, in addition to providing training to food handlers on GMP and correct use of personal protective equipment and work clothes.
