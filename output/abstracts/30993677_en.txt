The last two decades witnessed significant advances in the treatment of acquired demyelinating disorders: thirteen new agents have been approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis in adults by the European Medicines Agency and US Food and Drug Administration in the last twenty years. Although the long-term efficacy and safety profiles of some new drugs are still being assessed in paediatric MS, clinicians may have to use them in the management of paediatric onset MS resistant to first-line medications, based on results obtained in adult-onset disease. This review summarizes the current approach to treatment in children with demyelinating syndromes. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Serological markers affect management in paediatric demyelinating diseases. Antibodies against aquaporin-4 and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein should be tested in children with acute demyelinating disease. New therapeutic agents currently in trial for pediatric disease should be used with close follow-up.
