To compare postoperative radiographic outcomes of Schatzker type V and VI tibial plateau fractures treated with double-plate or single lateral locked plate. Sixty-three patients operated from December 2011 to February 2016 were selected, 47 from the double-plate group and 16 from the single lateral locked plate group. Minimum follow-up for all patients was 6 months. Fracture reduction evaluation was based on radiographic parameters: joint reduction, sagittal alignment, coronal alignment, and condylar width. Radiographic evaluation showed no statistical difference in the immediate or late postoperative periods. Despite the reduced sample, this study is aligned with current results published in the medical literature. The severity of Schatzker type V and VI tibial plateau fractures can be minimized by the correct indication for the implant regarding fracture morphology. <b>Level of Evidence III, Retrospective comparative study.</b>
