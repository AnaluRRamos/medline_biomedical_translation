People with physical disabilities may, in interaction with facilitators and barriers, modify their participation in society. The environment, in the panorama of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), plays a relevant role in health and in the expression of functioning. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the influence of environmental factors on physical disability, based on the theoretical framework of the ICF. A systematic review of the literature was performed based on the recommendations of the following documents: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology Statement (STROBE). The studies selected confirmed the theoretical precepts of the ICF. The interference of the physical and social environment, in general, might be attributed to different clinical conditions, especially in neurology, both in quantitative and qualitative studies. Methodological limitations were observed that may be obstacles to consolidating some guidelines, which should encourage further research on the subject with judicious methods, validated instruments and carefully selected samples.
