Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are usually found in the pelvic area and the brain. These vascular anomalies are rarely reported in the toes. AVMs in the toes may be asymptomatic, but can also cause atypical symptoms. Congenital AVMs can expand as patients age and manifest in adulthood. They may be provoked by injury. Acquired AVM might be caused by iatrogenic factors, venous or arterial catheterization, percutaneous invasive vascular procedures, surgery, or degenerative vascular disorders. An AVM can damage surrounding tissues and can cause destruction of skin, nails and bones. The course of the disease is often unpredictable and diagnosis is usually delayed as a result.
