The underlying cause of death is the single diagnosis to which the cause of death is attributed. Other diagnostic codes written in the death certificate are the multiple causes. The study of the multiple causes allows the identification of the diseases present in the death. To analyze the underlying and multiple causes of death after revascularization of the lower limbs using open surgery or angioplasty. Two databases of the Public Health System of Rio de Janeiro were used: Authorizations for Hospitalizations 2006/10, and Statements of Deaths 2006/11. Probabilistic linkage of records between databases was performed using the Stata program. The most frequent underlying and multiple cause of death was Diabetes mellitus. The second was the systemic atherosclerotic disease represented by peripheral arterial disease, ischemic coronary disease and cerebrovascular disease. The analysis of multiple causes revealed septicemia, iatrogenic and complications after surgery, as well as renal failure after angio- plasty. Patients submitted to lower limb revascularization procedures had a higher overall mortality rate than the population of the State of Rio de Janeiro over 50 years of age, for all causes and specific ones. The period of highest risk of death was up to 30 days after hospital discharge, demonstrating the need to improve medical and hospital care before, during and after procedures. The study of multiple causes revealed adverse events and complications that were not chosen as the underlying cause.
