Patients with acute myocardial infarction may have a large infarcted area and ventricular dysfunction despite early thrombolysis and revascularization. To investigate the behavior of circulating cytokines in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and their relationship with ventricular function. In the BATTLE-AMI (B and T Types of Lymphocytes Evaluation in Acute Myocardial Infarction) trial, patients with STEMI were treated with a pharmacoinvasive strategy. The plasma levels of cytokines (IL-1 <i>β</i> , IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-18) were tested using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at baseline and after 30 days. Infarcted mass and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were examined by 3-T cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. All p-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Compared to baseline, lower levels were detected for IL-1 <i>β</i> (p = 0.028) and IL-18 (p < 0.0001) 30 days after STEMI, whereas higher levels were observed for IL-4 (p = 0.001) and IL-10 (p < 0.0001) at that time point. Conversely, no changes were detected for IL-6 levels (p = 0.63). The levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and IL-6 correlated at baseline (rho = 0.45, p < 0.0001) and 30 days after STEMI (rho = 0.29, p = 0.009). At baseline, correlation between IL-6 levels and LVEF was also observed (rho = -0.50, p = 0.004). During the first month post-MI, we observed a marked improvement in the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, except for IL-6. These findings suggest residual inflammatory risk.
