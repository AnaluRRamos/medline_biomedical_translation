To verify the access to speech-language pathology (SLP) therapy and continuity of assistance in Primary Health Care (PHC) for victims of motorcycle accidents. A quantitative and qualitative study was conducted at a large hospital in the city of Recife, Pernanbuco state, Brazil. Among the 99 victims recruited between June and July 2014, 30 had SLP complaints as a result of the accidents. After hospital discharge, all victims were contacted for investigation of the SLP rehabilitation process. Absolute and relative frequencies were used for the analysis in PHC, and data were displayed in tables for the therapy cases. Among the 30 individuals who reported having alterations of the stomatognathic system, eight were undergoing rehabilitation and 18 reported residing in an area covered by the Family Health Strategy (primary care modality). Seeking and obtaining continuity of treatment (medication and bandaging) in primary care were frequent; in contrast, home visits were less frequent. The main obstacles to access SLP therapy were distance to the service and waiting time to begin treatment. This study identified obstacles that hamper access to SLP therapy in PHC, such as the low frequency of home visits, contributing to the fragmentation of continuous and complete care for victims.
