This study set out to analyze social and geographical inequalities in the adequacy of prenatal dental care in the Unified Health System (SUS) of the Greater Vitória Metropolitan Region, Espírito Santo, Brazil. A cross-sectional study was carried out with 1209 postpartum women living in the region admitted to hospital at SUS facilities for childbirth between 2010 and 2011. Data were collected on prenatal medical-dental care, the impact of oral health on the quality of life of pregnant women (Oral Health Impact Profile-14), and predisposing characteristics. Prenatal care was adequate when care corresponded to the recommended treatment. The adequacy of dental care during prenatal care was analyzed using a multivariate logistic model. Oral health was found to have an impact on the quality of life of 102 (8.4%) pregnant women and the adequacy of dental care during prenatal care was only 15.4% (n=156). There was a greater chance of adequacy of prenatal dental care in Vitória (OR=2.44; IC=1.63-3.66), in regions covered by the family health strategy (OR=1.88; IC=1.22-2.89), and in areas with a higher proportion of pregnant women with access to quality prenatal care (OR=3.59; IC=1.64-7.84). Contextual inequalities were decisive for the inadequacy of dental care in prenatal care.
