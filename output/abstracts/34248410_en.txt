To evaluate the cure rate for dorsal synovial cysts of the wrist with aspiration and percutaneous sclerotherapy using 75% hypertonic glucose. We enrolled 45 patients older than 18 years with untreated dorsal synovial cysts of the wrist. They underwent percutaneous aspiration and sclerotherapy with 75% hypertonic glucose 75%. A maximum of two procedures were conducted for each cyst at a 4-week interval. We analyzed age, sex, affected side, history of previous trauma, wrist goniometry, grip strength, wrist pain by the visual analogue scale, complications, and hand function questionnaire scores. We evaluated 45 patients (30 female, 15 male, mean age 38.2 years with 47 cysts). Four weeks after the first procedure, 72.3% cysts were palpable and visible. At 24 weeks after the first procedure, 57.4% cysts evolved to cure and 42.6% persisted. Treatment of dorsal synovial cyst of the wrist with aspiration and percutaneous sclerotherapy using 75% hypertonic glucose achieved a 57.4% cure rate after 24 weeks. <b><i>Level of Evidence IV, Case series</i></b>.
