Total knee arthroplasty is an elective procedure performed on relatively healthy individuals. However, due to the inherent risk of venous thromboembolism, drugs are used for its prophylaxis. The objective of the present study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature to compare the efficacy of enoxaparin and rivaroxaban in preventing this complication and the risk of intraoperative bleeding. We reviewed the SciELO, Pubmed and Cochrane databases with the descriptors knee arthroplasty, rivaroxaban and enoxaparin through the PICO search strategy. Inclusion criteria were the articles during the study period comparing both drugs in knee arthroplasty. Relevant criteria to study eligibility were articles published since 2010 and with a sample of more than 20 patients; studies obtained in their entirety; and studies with follow-up of more than 12 months. The variables used to compare the articles were the most common postoperative complications of knee arthroplasties: venous thromboembolism and bleeding. We used the Review Man software, version 5.3, for structuring the review. In the studies analyzed, considering symptomatic venous thromboembolism, rivaroxaban resulted in higher benefits when compared to enoxaparin.
