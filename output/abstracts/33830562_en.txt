Equine pastern dermatitis (EPD), a multifactorial syndrome, manifests as skin lesions of variable severity in the pastern area. Despite the widespread use of antibacterial therapy for treating this condition, little is known about the contributing bacteria. To investigate the bacterial skin microbiota in EPD-affected and unaffected (control) pasterns. Case-control study with 80 client-owned horses; each with at least one EPD-affected and one control pastern. Horses were grouped by the form of EPD (mild, exudative or proliferative), the assigned severity grade and type of pretreatment (disinfectant, topical antibacterial or no antibacterial pretreatment). Skin swabs were obtained, and the microbiota composition was compared between the groups. Bacterial alpha diversity was reduced in affected pasterns (P < 0.001) and this reduction was significantly associated with the EPD forms (P < 0.001), and not with the type of pretreatment (P > 0.14). Analyses of beta-diversity confirmed a disordering of the skin microbiota (P = 0.004) in affected versus control pasterns, that was particularly profound in more severe lesions. The type of pretreatment was not significantly associated with this disordering. Four differentially abundant families were detected, of which Staphylococcaceae was the most distinct. The relative abundance of staphylococci was significantly increased in affected pasterns (P = 0.011), particularly in those that had received antibacterial treatment previously. Changes in the microbiota are associated with the EPD form or severity of lesions. The role of bacteria in the pathogenesis of EPD as well as the propriety and consequences of antibacterial treatment should therefore be further investigated.
