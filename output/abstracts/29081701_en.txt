The purpose of this study was to compare union rates for isolated subtalar arthrodesis with and without the use of bone grafts or bone graft substitutes. We retrospectively reviewed 135 subtalar fusions with a mean follow-up of 18 ± 14 months. The standard approach was used for all surgeries. Graft materials included b-tricalcium phosphate, demineralized bone matrix, iliac crest autograft and allograft, and allograft cancellous chips. Successful subtalar fusion was determined clinically and radiographically. There was an 88% (37/42) union rate without graft use and an 83% (78/93) union rate with bone graft use. Odds ratio of union for graft versus no graft was 0.703 (95% CI, 0.237-2.08). The average time to union in the graft group was 3 ± 0.73 months and 3 ± 0.86 in the non-graft group, with no statistically significant difference detected (p = 0.56). Graft use did not improve union rates for subtalar arthrodesis. <b>Level of Evidence IV, Case Series.</b>
