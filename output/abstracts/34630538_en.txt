The kidneys and ureters are retroperitoneal structures in the upper part of the paravertebral gutters, tilted against the structures on the sides of the lowest two thoracic and upper three lumbar vertebrae, so that their anterior and posterior surfaces face antero-laterally and postero-medially, respectively. Congenital anomalies of the urinary tract are often the underlying cause of renal pathologies; 40% of these pathological conditions are due to variations in location, shape, and size of the kidney(s), calyces, ureter, or bladder. This case report describes the presence of a unilateral non-rotated left kidney with vascular and ureter variations found during routine cadaveric dissection for medical graduates. Alterations in rotation of the kidney and its relation to structures at the hilum have great clinical significance when conducting surgical procedures like partial nephrectomy, nephron sparing surgery, and renal transplantation.
