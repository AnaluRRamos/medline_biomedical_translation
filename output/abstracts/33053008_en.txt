To analyze insulin therapy performed by people with diabetes in Primary Healthcare. A cross-sectional, descriptive and quantitative study. Data collection was carried out through an interview using a form with sociodemographic, clinical and insulin therapy variables. Absolute and relative frequencies as well as prevalence ratio were calculated and the chi-squared test was used, with p<0.05 being significant. The sample consisted of 150 patients. Most were female (66.7%), aged 50-85 years (79.3%) and some were illiterate (16.7%). Type 2 diabetes (62.0%) with complications (42.7%), and using oral hypoglycemic agents and insulin stood out. Syringes/needles (83.1%), lancets (85.5%), reagent strips (91.0%) and insulin vials (93.8%) were stored incorrectly by the majority. The correct form predominated in preparation, application and transport. Waste was disposed of incorrectly. In the general analysis most performed the insulin therapy stages inappropriately (93.3%). Sociodemographic and clinical variables did not influence insulin therapy, but there was a significant difference in the intra-group analysis for incorrect performance in some groups. Insulin therapy was inappropriately performed in most cases.
