To analyze how the indications of comprehensiveness translate into the teaching-learning process in a nursing undergraduate course. Qualitative case study carried out with professors of a Nursing Undergraduate Course. Data collection occurred through documentary analysis, non-participant observation and individual interviews. Data analysis was guided from an analytical matrix following the steps of the operative proposal. Eight professors participated in the study. Some indications of comprehensiveness such as dialogue, listening, mutual respect, bonding and welcoming are present in the daily life of some professors. The indications of comprehensiveness are applied by some professors in the pedagogical relationship. The results refer to the Comprehensiveness of teaching-learning in a single and double loop model, and in this the professor and the student assume an open posture for new possibilities in the teaching-learning process. Comprehensiveness, as it is recognized as a pedagogical principle, allows the disruption of a professor-centered teaching and advances in collective learning, enabling the professor and student to create their own design anchored in a reflective process about their practices and the reality found in the health services.
