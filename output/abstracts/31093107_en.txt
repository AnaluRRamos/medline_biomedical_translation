The objective of this article is to describe the actions undertaken by the emergency medical team (EMT) of the Mexican Social Security Institute (MSSI) during the emergency caused by the earthquake of September 7, 2017 (magnitude 8.2; epicenter 133 km southwest of Pijijiapan, Chiapas, Mexico). After the initial intersectoral assessment of the emergency had been conducted, the health sector stepped in. As part of this response effort, and once it was determined that a large number of people had been injured and that the health risks facing the affected population were substantial, the MSSI deployed an EMT equipped and trained to provide support in the medical and surgical treatment of injured people. The actions of the EMT, composed of specialists in medical and surgical emergencies and disaster situations, included providing medical care to 252 patients, managing the transfer of 57 patients, and helping to set up an emergency hospital. To improve response efforts during disaster situations, it is necessary to follow the process of forming, registering, and training EMTs at the national and international levels.
