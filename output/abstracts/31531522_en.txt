This study was an assessment of time trends in morbid obesity prevalence in the adult population in Brazil's state capitals from 2006 to 2017. A cross-sectional study was performed with data from the Risk and Protective Factors Surveillance System for Chronic Noncommunicable Diseases Through Telephone Interview (Vigitel), analyzed by simple linear regression. The results showed an upward trend in morbid obesity prevalence in Brazil. Women showed higher prevalence rates (1.3% in 2006 and 1.9% in 2017) when compared to men (0.9% and 1.4%). The 25-44-year age bracket showed an upward trend from 0.9% to 2.1% (p < 0.001). There was an increase in morbid obesity in all levels of schooling and all regions of Brazil. The state capitals with upward trends in males were Campo Grande, Curitiba, Fortaleza, MacapÃ¡, Manaus, Palmas, Porto Velho, Rio Branco, and Teresina. In females, they were Belo Horizonte, Campo Grande, Rio de Janeiro, and Teresina. The growth in morbid obesity in Brazil sounds a warning on the urgent need to adopt measures to detain it, such as regulation of ultra-processed foods and health education measures for the entire population.
