Hidrosadenitis supurativa is a chronic inflammatory disease with great physical and psychological impact. Although conservative treatments may be effective in mild forms of the disease, extensive surgical resection and reconstruction are necessary in more severe forms of the disease. The purpose of this paper is to describe our two-stage reconstructive procedure regarding this kind of disease. We present a clinical case of a patient with severe, bilateral axillary hidrosadenitis. In the first surgical step we excised the lesions and applied the artificial dermis secured with negative pressure wound therapy. In the second step we used a split thickness skin graft to close the wound and again applied negative pressure wound therapy. The graft take was very good, without complications. The cosmetic outcome is acceptable and shoulder mobility was not compromised. No recurrence was detected (nine months follow up).
