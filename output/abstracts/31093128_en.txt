To collect information - and provide it to decision-makers in health programs in general and mental health programs in particular - on epidemiological patterns in suicide deaths among young adults and adolescents in Ecuador. A cross-sectional ecological study was conducted using data obtained from records of deaths by suicide among young adults and adolescents in Ecuador from 2001 to 2014. For analysis, results were disaggregated by geographic region, sex, age, ethnic group and suicide method. Rates of death by suicide (per 100,000 population) and relative risks (RR) for suicide were estimated by sex and region. Between 2001 and 2014, 4,855 suicides were recorded among adolescents and young adults. The highest estimated risk was found among males aged 15 to 24 years and adolescents living in the Amazon region, followed by those living in the Andean region. Mestizos were the ethnic group with the greatest number of suicides, although 40% of young people who commit suicide in the Amazon region are indigenous. The most frequent method was by hanging, followed by pesticide poisoning. Suicide among adolescents and young adults is an important public health problem in Ecuador. Since various psychological, social, and cultural influences come into play, there is wide variation among regions, age groups, and ethnic groups. Restricting access to pesticides and other chemical products, implementing universal prevention programs and programs in education centers in the areas with the highest rates, and targeting vulnerable populations for specific interventions could help reduce the suicide rate among young people in Ecuador.
