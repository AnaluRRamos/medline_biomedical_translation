The scope of this integrative review of the literature was to assess if the Kangaroo-Mother Care Method as implemented in Brazil, from the first stage to outpatient follow-up, has an influence on breastfeeding. Brazilian research published in national and international journals in Portuguese, English or Spanish in the leading research databases between the years 2000 to 2017 was included, with full articles available and theme related to the scope of this study. A total of 1328 articles were located and articles not conducted in Brazil, literature review articles and themes not related to the Kangaroo-Mother Care Method were excluded, with 21 studies eventually being selected. The research results indicated a positive influence of the Kangaroo-Mother Care Method on breastfeeding and establishing a mother-child bond. However, the third stage or outpatient follow-up proved not to be effective in maintaining breastfeeding. Greater participation of primary care in home care provided to preterm newborns is necessary, with a view to promoting exclusive breastfeeding up to six months of age and extended up to two years of age.
