The study aimed to evaluate the correlation between the PRWE score with other measurements that are already widely used. This was a prospective, cross-sectional, single-center study. Sixty-eight consecutive patients underwent surgical treatment for distal radius fractures (internal fixation by locked volar plate or transarticular external fixation). They were evaluated independently by PRWE, DASH, VAS range of motion, strength, and radiographic criteria, in one year of follow up. The Mann-Whitney test was used to compare continuous variables and the Spearman correlation to correlate the outcomes of interest. PRWE correlated significantly with DASH (<i>p</i> < 0.001) and VAS (<i>p</i> < 0.001). There were no significant correlations with other outcome measures. PRWE presents significant moderate correlation only with DASH and VAS. Range of motion, strength, and radiographic criteria do not interfere in the PRWE outcome.
