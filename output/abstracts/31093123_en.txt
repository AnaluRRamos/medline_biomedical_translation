Although bullying involvement has been associated with adolescent substance use, most of this evidence comes from high-income countries. Little is known about substance use among perpetrator-victims in low- and middle-income countries. This study explores the association between types of bullying involvement and adolescent substance use in Brazil. Data for this cross-sectional study came from the 2015 Pesquisa Nacional de Sa√∫de do Escolar [National Adolescent School-based Health Survey] (PeNSE), a nationwide school-based survey of Brazilian ninth graders. Substance use was analyzed as any substance use (i.e., use of alcohol, cigarettes, or marijuana in the previous 30 days) and substance co-use (i.e., use of all three substances). Logistic regression analyses were conducted, and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) were calculated, adjusting for demographic characteristics and student loneliness. Odds of any substance use for bullying perpetrators-only and for perpetrator-victims, respectively, were significantly higher compared to no bullying involvement (aOR = 2.99, 95% CI = 2.71-3.30 and aOR = 2.52, 95% CI = 2.31-2.75). Adjusted odds of substance co-use were also significantly higher among perpetrators-only and perpetrator-victims (aOR = 4.04, 95% CI = 3.05-5.35 and aOR = 3.49, 95% CI = 2.71-4.51, respectively). Victimization-only was associated with a 14% increase in the odds of any substance use (aOR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.07-1.22). The results underscore the complex relationship between adolescent bullying involvement and substance use. Findings also indicate the type of bullying involvement, as well as demographic and psychological factors, should be taken into consideration when assessing adolescent health-risk behaviors.
