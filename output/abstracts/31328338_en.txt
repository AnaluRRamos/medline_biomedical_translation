Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous disease histologically characterized by naked granulomas in various mammals. Canine sarcoidosis is a rare disease which can cause nonpruritic papule, plaques and nodules on the trunk, neck, face and ear; it is usually treated with corticosteroids. To date, there are no published reports on alternatives to corticosteroids treatment. To report a case of canine cutaneous sarcoidosis successfully treated with oral ciclosporin. An 11-year-old beagle dog was presented with multiple pleomorphic plaques on the lateral thighs and dorsal trunk. Skin punch biopsy specimen were collected and analysed via routine histological examination and immunohistochemistry. After 14 weeks of oral ciclosporin treatment, repeat skin biopsy specimens were collected. Histopathological examination revealed noncaseating epithelioid cell granuloma formation in the dermis. Dermal epithelioid cells were positive for CD18 and Iba1, but not for CD3, CD20 and E-cadherin based on immunohistochemistry findings. Acid-fast bacteria, fungi and Leishmania spp. were not detected by special stains, culture or polymerase chain reaction. An initial two week treatment with immunosuppressive doses of oral prednisolone and doxycycline was not effective. Skin lesions were almost in remission after 14 weeks of oral ciclosporin treatment without adverse events. Histologically, the dermal granulomatous lesions regressed and were replaced by fibrous tissues after ciclosporin treatment. This case report describes the clinical and histopathological presentation including immunohistochemistry and treatment outcome of a case of canine sarcoidosis Ciclosporin may be an effective alternative to corticosteroids for treating canine sarcoidosis.
