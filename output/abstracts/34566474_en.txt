To analyze the cases of slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) submitted to surgery at the Pediatric Orthopedics Surgery service of the Hospital Risoleta Tolentino Neves (HRTN), Belo Horizonte/MG, between 2016 and 2019. Patients treated for SCFE at the HRTN between January/2016 and January/2019 participated in this study. The following data were collected: gender, age, affected side, procedure performed, and postoperative complications. Twenty-one patients were treated at HRTN during the specified period. Among these, most were female (57%) with mean age of 12 years. At the initial diagnosis, about 80% of the patients presented with chronic/acute-on-chronic epiphysis. The left hip was slightly more affected than the right (6:5), with a bilateral rate of 47%, and avascular necrosis was the most frequent complication, occurring in 33% of cases. Slipped femoral capital epiphysis is associated with high morbidity; thus, early diagnosis, endocrine disorder investigation, and appropriate surgical treatment are key for improving these patients' clinical and functional outcome. <b><i>Level of Evidence II, Retrospective study.</i></b>
