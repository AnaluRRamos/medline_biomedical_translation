Arterial hypertension (HTA) represents a major risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. It is not yet known which specific molecular mechanisms are associated with the development of essential hypertension. In this study, we analyzed the association between LRP1 monocyte mRNA expression, LRP1 protein expression, and carotid intima media thickness (cIMT) of patients with essential hypertension. The LRP1 monocyte mRNA expression and protein levels and cIMT were quantified in 200 Mexican subjects, 91 normotensive (NT) and 109 hypertensive (HT). Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. HT patients group had highly significant greater cIMT as compared to NT patients (p=0.002) and this correlated with an increase in the expression of LRP1 mRNA expression (6.54 vs. 2.87) (p = 0.002) and LRP1 protein expression (17.83 vs. 6.25), respectively (p = 0.001). These differences were maintained even when we divided our study groups, taking into account only those who presented dyslipidemia in both, mRNA (p = 0.041) and proteins expression (p < 0.001). It was also found that Ang II mediated LRP1 induction on monocytes in a dose and time dependent manner with significant difference in NT vs. HT (0.195 ± 0.09 vs. 0.226 ± 0.12, p = 0.046). An increase in cIMT was found in subjects with hypertension, associated with higher mRNA and LRP1 protein expressions in monocytes, irrespective of the presence of dyslipidemias in HT patients. These results suggest that LRP1 upregulation in monocytes from Mexican hypertensive patients could be involved in the increased cIMT. (Arq Bras Cardiol. 2021; 116(1):56-65)
