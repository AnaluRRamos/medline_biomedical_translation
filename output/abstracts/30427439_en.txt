This study aimed to investigate the association between socioeconomic and behavioral factors, general health, oral health, and plaque accumulation and oral mucosa condition outcomes in the elderly. This is a cross-sectional study conducted from 2004 to 2005 with 785 elderly dwellers of the city of Carlos Barbosa (RS), Brasil. We used questionnaires to collect socioeconomic, behavior and health status data. The physical examination of the oral structures comprised the Mucosal-Plaque Index proposed by Henriksen (MPS). A higher prevalence of moderate/severe plaque accumulation was observed in the elderly group, in less educated male elderly. The use of full upper dentures and income under one minimum wage were protective factors for moderate/severe plaque accumulation. Only the variables of the first block of the conceptual structure, male gender (OR = 2.13; 95% CI 1.26-3.61) and lower education (OR = 1.37; 95% CI 1.06-1.78) remained associated with an unacceptable MPS score. The findings suggest that, as per MPS, less educated male elderly are more likely to have poor oral health.
