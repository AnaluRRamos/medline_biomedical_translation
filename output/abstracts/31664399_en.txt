In old age, the ailing patient's body becomes estranged and reveals an awareness of alterity. This paper investigates how the body of the elderly addresses the estrangement as a subject, producing its own actions in the experience of disease and practice of public health. The research, developed using the qualitative approach of an anthropological nature, is based on the assumptions of ethnography. Individual interviews with a semi-structured script in the universe of 57 elderly people were conducted. The methodology of Signs, Meanings and Actions oriented the data collection and analysis enabling the investigation of representations and concrete behaviors associated with the otherness of the body. There was the sense of production of otherness in relation to two analytical categories associated with aging and disease. A split between the active body of the memory and another experienced with limitations in the present is detected, reflecting the confrontation of self-care and adherence to treatment. The body of the elderly individual is heir to a body image that remodels constantly, depriving the elderly of their place as contemporary owners of their bodies, as they become other persons.
