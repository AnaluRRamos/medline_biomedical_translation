The purpose of this paper is to describe the opportunities and challenges of training processes in the coordination of regional and national communication initiatives for arboviral disease prevention, using the lessons learned in the Cuban context as an example. In February 2016 and December 2017, professional staff from the Pedro Kour√≠ Institute of Tropical Medicine attended workshops for strengthening communication capacities for arboviral disease prevention in primary health care settings through gradual introduction of the most recent approaches promoted by the Pan American Health Organization in this regard. National, provincial, municipal, and health area specialists with diverse professional profiles were trained; multidisciplinary teams were strengthened at the different levels; specific tasks were assigned and coordinated at each level; and demonstration sites were established for the communication approaches promoted in the workshops. Learning needs in the field of mass communication were also identified, and activities for training technical staff and for monitoring and evaluation were introduced in the national strategy 2018-2021 to guarantee the implementation and sustainability of communication activities. Notwithstanding, participating institutions will have to address the challenges characteristic of communication for arboviral disease prevention, which include the rotation of trained personnel, the mobilization of resources for communication, and the identification of appropriate evaluation indicators.
