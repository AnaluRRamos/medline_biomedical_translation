The use of polypharmacy may be due to the concomitant presence of chronic conditions, medical care by several doctors simultaneously and self-medication. Combined with the vulnerability of the elderly to the effects of drugs due to pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes, polypharmacy makes this population more susceptible to adverse outcomes. In Brazil, studies show that polypharmacy is a common problem among elderly people. However, few information is available on the association between polypharmacy and mortality. It was assessed the survival of the elderly from SÃ£o Paulo city exposed to the use of polypharmacy (five or more medications). That was a population-based cohort, the Health, Well-Being and Aging Study (SABE Study), conducted from 2006 to 2010. The sample was composed of 1,258 individuals aged 60 years or more. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional risks model were used to examine the association between polypharmacy and mortality. The probability of survival after five years of the users of polypharmacy at baseline was 77.2%, while among the non-users was 85.5%. Polypharmacy remained as a risk factor for death even after adjustment in other conditions associated with mortality, such as age, gender, income, chronic diseases and hospitalization. The results point polypharmacy as an indicator of mortality in elderly people. The use of multiple medications by the elderly should be carefully assessed to avoid or minimize the damage to this population.
