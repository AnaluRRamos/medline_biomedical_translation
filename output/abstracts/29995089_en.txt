In an ethical dilemma, there is always an option that can be identified as the best one to be chosen. When it is impossible to adopt such option, the situation can lead professionals to experience moral distress. This review aims to define the issue of moral distress and propose coping strategies. Systematic searches in the MEDLINE/PubMed and SciELO databases were conducted using the keywords 'moral distress' and 'moral suffering' in articles published between 2000 and 2017. This review was non-exhaustive and contextual, with a focus on definitions, etiologies and methods of resolution for moral distress. In the daily practice of intensive care, moral distress was commonly related to the prolongation of patients' suffering and feelings of helplessness, as well as difficulties in communication among team members. Coping strategies for moral distress included organizational, personal and administrative actions. Actions such as workload management, mutual support among professionals and the development of techniques to cultivate open communication, reflection and questioning within the multidisciplinary team were identified. In clinical practice, health professionals need to be recognized as moral agents, and the development of moral courage was considered helpful to overcome ethical dilemmas and interprofessional conflicts. Both in pediatric and adult intensive care, professionals are challenged by questions about their practice, and they may experience moral distress. This suffering can be minimized and solved by understanding that the focus is always on the patient and acting with moral courage and good communication in an environment of mutual respect.
