Within the context of elbow-level trauma, fractures with a coronal line at the distal extremity of the humerus are rare and result from indirect axial trauma with the arm extended. These are difficult-to-treat intra-articular fractures, since they require stable anatomical reduction in order to maintain joint congruence and diminish complications such as stiffness. This paper reports a case that occurred in a young man who suffered a fall from a ladder that resulted in a Bryan and Morrey type IV intra-articular fracture of the humerus. The injury was treated surgically by means of an anterior access, using osteosynthesis with two Herbert screws that were inserted from anterior to posterior.
