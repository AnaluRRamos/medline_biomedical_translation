Our objective is to describe the technique of intramedullary (IM) nailing of lateral malleolus in the surgical management of ankle fractures. Fracture reduction is performed either percutaneously with a small pointed reduction clamp in simple oblique fractures or using longitudinal traction and rotation for comminuted fractures, thus reducing complications related to open reduction and internal fixation with a plate. The technique has been shown to be simple and reproducible. In addition, the technique allows early weight bearing, which accelerates rehabilitation and potentially fasten fracture healing. IM nailing is a viable option for the fixation of the of lateral malleolus in ankle fractures and should be considered in the surgeon's armamentarium.
