This article discusses current therapeutic approaches that use the body in motion, noting the historical context and highlighting the main concepts and practices. The most frequently cited psychotherapeutic suggestions in the academic literature and in professional practice are identified, particularly dance/movement therapy (with eight main approaches) and therapeutic dance practices not strictly located within the field of psychotherapy (such as biodance and groups that link contemporary dance with the principles of somatic education). These approaches are compared and contrasted to more precisely identify each approach and augment dialog between them.
