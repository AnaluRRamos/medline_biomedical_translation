The aim of this study is to evaluate the management capacity of the Specialized Component of Pharmaceutical Services (CEAF, in Portuguese) in the state of SÃ£o Paulo (SP), according to the organizational, operational and sustainability aspects. The study was designed as an evaluative investigation, with the adoption of a theoretical model and protocol of indicators developed for application at the national level and validated (Nominal Group and Traditional Committee) for application in the reality of the SP. The data collection in the 35 CEAF units was carried out in 2017 and 2018, and covered all technical areas that participate in the management/execution of CEAF, in both its central and regional scopes. The assessment of management capacity was based on a critical analysis of the obtained results, analyzing their strengths and weaknesses. After collecting data from 35 CEAF units, it was found that the management capacity was positive in the operational dimension with challenges concentrated in the other dimensions. The results showed greater investments and development in the technical aspects of pharmaceutical services, but deficiencies in such areas as the monitoring of clinical results, infrastructure, regulation, and communication with the actors involved.
