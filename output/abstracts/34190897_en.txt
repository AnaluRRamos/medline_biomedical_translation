To evaluate the correlation between religiosity, spirituality, and self-esteem in adolescents with uni- and bilateral cleft lip and palate. Correlational and cross-sectional study developed in a public and tertiary hospital in Brazil between July 2018 and February 2019. The sample comprised 100 adolescents divided into two groups: G1 (unilateral cleft, 50 participants) and G2 (bilateral cleft, 50 participants). For data collection, three instruments were used: Sociodemographic Questionnaire, DUREL Religion index, Rosenberg self-esteem scale. Statistical analysis was performed with the tests Chi-squared, Mann-Whitney, Pearson Correlation, and analysis of linear correlation strength, with a 5% significance level (p â‰¥ 0.05). Only organizational religiosity was higher in G1 when compared with G2 (p = 0.03). The overall self-esteem was satisfactory for both groups; however, there was no significant difference between them (p = 0.34). No correlation between religiosity and spirituality with self-esteem were identified for G1 and G2. The adolescents with uni- or bilateral cleft lip and palate presented high levels of religiosity, spirituality, and self-esteem. However, no correlation between these variables was identified.
