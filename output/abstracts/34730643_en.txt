This paper aims to present an analysis of the Quality in Health and Patient Safety Training Program (CQSSP) results of the SÃ©rgio Arouca National School of Public Health. This is a quantitative, qualitative, cross-sectional, and descriptive study based on the Kirkpatrick's Evaluation Model. The findings provide us with a clearer picture of the success of the CQSSP pedagogical intent through a positive assessment for the Reaction, Learning, Behavioral, Results levels. From the analysis of the perception of the graduates, we observed that 82% of them started to fully consider the occurrence of an error in the provision of care, 68% incorporated the acquired knowledge into their professional practice, and 73% started to study and research themes related to Patient Safety (PS). We also conducted a survey on the number of Patient Safety Centers or equivalent bodies established or reformulated during or after the CQSSP. We also evaluated the extent of the contribution of the course in the implementation of Patient Safety protocols and actions in hospitals. The findings point to a significant contribution of the CQSSP to PS and the quality of hospital care.
