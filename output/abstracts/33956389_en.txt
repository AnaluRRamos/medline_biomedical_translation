It has been demonstrated that immunoglobulin (Ig)E specific for cross-reactive carbohydrate determinants (CCD) is present in the serum of sensitized humans, dogs and cats, and that these CCD-specific antibodies might confound serological testing. The objective was to determine whether or not CCD-reactive antibodies occur in horses and to investigate the prevalence of CCD-reactive IgE antibodies in equine sera using a monoclonal cocktail-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay designed to detect allergen-specific IgE in horses, and to evaluate a means for successful inhibition of these CCD. Sera from 28 horses suspected of clinical allergy were evaluated, with and without a proprietary inhibitor which contains carbohydrates derived from bromelain (BROM-CCD), using a panel of 72 allergens that include 15 grasses, 17 trees, nine weeds, five mites, 12 fungi, 12 insects and two environmental allergens. Twenty-five samples were shown to be reactive to at least one of the allergens, and 15 were reactive to 10 allergens or more. BROM-CCD had minimal effect on the mite reactivity in any of the positive samples; however, substantial inhibition for pollen allergens (trees, grasses and weeds) was demonstrable. Reduction in signal to pollens ranged from 20% to 100% for samples that were inhibited by CCD-BROM. These results demonstrate that CCD-reactive IgE antibodies are evident in horses and that BROM-CCD can be effective in reducing reactions with these irrelevant carbohydrates and will likely yield a more accurate inÂ vitro allergen reactivity profile for selection of allergens included in an immunotherapeutic regime.
