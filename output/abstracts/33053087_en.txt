To elaborate and show an innovative speech and language guidance program for smartphones, tablets, and computers, with technological support. The program aims to help parents of children at risk for language disorder in order to minimize the consequences of a developmental language disorder (DLD). An app was developed to provide a dynamic interaction between the researcher and the families for at a distance intervention, aiming to reach the greatest number of children to promote language development in a broad, low-cost and effective way. The content was organized in video-lessons (theoretical orientations were carried out in the form of video-lessons, taught by the researcher), videos (documentaries and videos from YouTube), reports (reports linked to sites specializing in child development), complementary content (cultural and leisure activities to be done in family) and activities (activities to stimulate the skills worked on in each week's video lesson proposed in the application). We created a remote orientation program proposing an innovative, technological, and motivating therapeutic environment compatible with the reality of today's families.
