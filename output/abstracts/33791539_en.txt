The typical orientation of a neutrally buoyant fish is with the venter down and the head pointed anteriorly with a horizontally oriented body. However, various advanced teleosts will reorient the body vertically for feeding, concealment, or prehension. The shrimpfish (<i>Aeoliscus punctulatus</i>) maintains a vertical orientation with the head pointed downward. This posture is maintained by use of the beating fins as the position of the center of buoyancy nearly corresponds to the center of mass. The shrimpfish swims with dorsum of the body moving anteriorly. The cross-sections of the body have a fusiform design with a rounded leading edge at the dorsum and tapering trailing edge at the venter. The median fins (dorsal, caudal, anal) are positioned along the venter of the body and are beat or used as a passive rudder to effect movement of the body in concert with active movements of pectoral fins. Burst swimming and turning maneuvers by yawing were recorded at 500 frames/s. The maximum burst speed was 2.3 body lengths/s, but when measured with respect to the body orientation, the maximum speed was 14.1 body depths/s. The maximum turning rate by yawing about the longitudinal axis was 957.5â€‰degrees/s. Such swimming performance is in line with fishes with a typical orientation. Modification of the design of the body and position of the fins allows the shrimpfish to effectively swim in the head-down orientation.
