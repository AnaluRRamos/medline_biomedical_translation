Three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography coupled with speckle-tracking echocardiographic (STE) capability is a novel methodology which has been demontrated to be useful for the assessment of left atrial (LA) volumes and functional properties. There is increased scientific interest on myocardial deformation analysis in adult patients with corrected tetralogy of Fallot (cTOF). To compare LA volumes, volume-based functional properties and strain parameters between cTOF patients and age- and gender-matched healthy controls. The study population consisted of 19 consecutive adult patients with cTOF in sinus rhythm nursing at the University of Szeged, Hungary (mean age: 37.9 ± 11.3 years, 8 men, who had repair at the age of 4.1 ± 2.5 years). They all had undergone standard transthoracic two-dimensional Doppler echocardiographic study extended with 3DSTE. Their results were compared to 23 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (mean age: 39.2 ± 10.6 years, 14 men). Increased LA volumes and reduced LA emptying fractions respecting cardiac cycle could be demonstrated in cTOF patients compared to controls. LA stroke volumes featuring all LA functions showed no differences between the 2 groups examined. LA global and mean segmental uni- and multidirectional peak strains featuring LA reservoir function were found to be diminished in adult patients with cTOF as compared to controls. Similarly to peak strains reduced global and mean segmental LA strains at atrial contraction characterizing atrial booster pump function could be demonstrated in cTOF patients as compared to controls. Significant deterioration of all LA functions could be demonstrated in adult patients with cTOF late after repair.
