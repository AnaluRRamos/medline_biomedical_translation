to determine the role of endoscopic ultrasonography (EU) in comparison with nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and examination under anesthesia (EUA) in the management of patients with perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease. we conducted a cross-sectional, observational study with patients with perianal Crohn's disease evaluated at a tertiary center in Curitiba, Paran√°, Brazil, from February 2016 to March 2017. All patients underwent EU, MRI and EUA. We evaluated the degree of agreement between the three methods by obtaining the Kappa coefficient. A Kappa value of 0.7 or greater indicated good agreement. We used the Friedman's non-parametric test to compare the number of fistulous paths detected in each modality. We set the level of statistical significance at p<0.05. we included 20 patients. There was agreement between the three exams in 11 patients. The level of Kappa agreement between the three exams was 0.53 (moderate - p<0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in relation to the number of fistulous trajectories detected in the three exams (p=0.641). EU failed to identify a fistulous pathway in three patients; MRI failed in three; and EUA failed in two. EU was comparable to MRI and EUA for the evaluation of perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease, and can be considered a valid exam for preoperative investigation of such patients.
