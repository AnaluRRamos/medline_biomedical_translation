The Health at School Programme is a Brazilian inter-sector policy resulting from a partnership between the Ministries of Health and Education to expand health actions to public school students, with a view to the comprehensive education of primary and lower middle school students. This qualitative study was carried out in 2016 to investigate Brazilian schoolchildren's perceptions of activities under the Health at School Programme. Data were collected from schoolchildren eleven to fourteen years of age using the written report (essay) as the instrument. Analysis of the reports highlighted two themes: 1. the Health at School Programme as care, and 2. the Health at School Programme as benevolence. For some, the activities meant the possibility of health care, of identifying problems and arranging solutions, and the opportunity for gaining information and learning that may be beneficial in maintaining health - the offer was received passively, however; for others, they were a blessing, a favour, for which they showed their gratitude. The schoolchildren were passive and receptive, without being proactive enough to produce their own health. Co-responsibility seems to be a seed that is still germinating.
