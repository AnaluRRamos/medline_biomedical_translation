To compare the mechanical parameters between two methods for stabilization through compression: 1.5 mm axial compression plate versus conical compression screw used as an intramedullary tutor. Polyurethane models (Sawbone(®)) that simulated transverse fractures of the proximal phalanx were used. The models were divided into three groups: lateral plate, conical screw and no implant. Greater force was needed to result in fatigue in the synthesis using an intramedullary plate. Thus, this model was proven to be mechanically superior to the model with the lateral plate. Stabilization using the Acutrak(®) screw for treating fractures in the model used in this trial presents mechanical results that are statistically significantly superior to those from the axial compression technique using the lateral plate (Aptus Hand(®)).
