Chronic kidney disease in children often determines poor nutritional status. Although renal transplantation (RTx) resolves endocrine and metabolic disorders, growth continues to be suboptimal and excessive weight gain may result in obesity. Evaluating the development of height and body mass index in renal transplanted children and adolescents and identifying associated factors with final nutritional status. We reviewed the medical records of 17 patients with regular follow-ups up to 24 months after RTx. Nutritional status was assessed by height-for-age (H/A) and body mass index-for-age (BMI/A). It was considered catch-up growth the increase in z-score H/A ≥ 0.5 standard deviation. Multiple linear regression was used to estimate the influence of factors clinical and demographic variables on anthropometric indicators at 24 months after RTx. Mean age was 9.1 ± 4.1 years old. Twenty-four months after RTx the mean z-score H/A increased from -2.66 ± 1.66 to -1.93 ± 1.08 (p ≤ 0.05), 47.0% of the patients showed catch-up growth and the same proportion showed z-score H/A < -2. Mean z-score BMI/A increased from -0.48 ± 1.03 at RTx to 0.80 ± 0.94 at third month after RTx (p < 0.001) and remained unchanged up to 24 months. The frequency of weight excess increased from 5.9% at RTx to 41.2% at 24 months. Age (r = -0.66; p = 0.006) and z-score H/A (r = -0.72; p = 0.002) at RTx were inversely associated with growth. Twenty-four months after transplant it was verified inadequate growth to recovery from stunting and excessive weight gain. RTx promoted greater growth in the youngest patients and most stunted at RTx.
