The project Palmas Free of Leprosy was implemented to improve indicators and deal with the disease, since the capital of Tocantins State is the most hyperendemic state capital in Brazil. This study measures the impact of the project's intervention through trend analysis of the priority indicators in Palmas, from 2002 to 2016. The study was based on an analysis of data from the Brazilian Information System for Notifiable Diseases (SINAN) and reports of applied training courses with problem-solving methodology. The indicators for new leprosy cases in Palmas residents were investigated, and the trends were identified by joinpoint regression analysis to assess the results. In the year the intervention project was implemented (2016), the detection rate for new cases in the overall population was 236.3/100,000 inhabitants, and this indicator showed a significant decrease of -7.5% from 2002 to 2014. From 2014 to 2016, there was a significant increase of 104.6% in overall detection. The detection rate in individuals under 15 years of age also showed a reduction of -4.6%, but in the years 2014, 2015, and 2016 there was an increase of 111.1%, together with detection rates for grades 0, 1, and 2, with 59.3%, 225.2%, and 121.7%, respectively. The proportion of cases detected by contact assessment showed a significant increase of 201.1% from 2014 to 2016. The data proved the effectiveness and potentiality of the project's intervention strategy for the diagnosis and control of leprosy in Palmas. The study provided evidence that timely diagnosis by primary care services results in indicators that reflect the real incidence of cases.
