To analyze the results from early intervention surgery in patients with the syndrome of fascial incarceration of the long thoracic nerve and consequent winged scapula. Six patients with a syndrome of nerve trapping without specific nerve strain limitations were followed up. The patients achieved improvement of their symptoms 6-20 months after the procedure. The motor symptoms completely disappeared, without any persistent pain. The medial deformity of the winged scapula improved in all cases, without any residual esthetic disorders. The approach of early surgical release seems to be a better predictor for recovery from non-traumatic paralysis of the anterior serratus muscle.
