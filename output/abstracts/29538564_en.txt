The number of dengue cases in Brazil has increased considerably in recent years. Therefore, it is necessary to ascertain if the historical evolution of the creation of dengue research groups in the country has been compatible with the increased incidence of the disease. This article seeks to evaluate the historical evolution of dengue research groups in Brazil and compare these data with epidemiological data related to the incidence of the disease. The ScriptGP computational tool was used to extract information from the Diret√≥rio de Grupos de Pesquisa do CNPq database about the development of research groups in dengue, a neglected disease (ND) that is a priority in Brazil, making it available in charts and pivot tables format. It was possible to identify the main research centers on dengue and compare the time series of the disease to the history of the creation of research groups. These results made it possible to speculate about the causes of the low effectiveness of prevention campaigns against dengue conducted in recent decades. The proposed data presentation allows for detailed analysis in the context of public health, of the progress of research into dengue, drawing attention to the need to reformulate strategies especially towards the distribution of research funding to study ND.
