This study aimed to evaluate the dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) in the experimental model of Achilles tendon injury. Twelve white male adults New Zealand rabbits were divided into two groups, a group with resection of the central portion of the Achilles tendon (n = 8) and a control group (n = 4). Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) was performed 4 weeks after the surgical procedure, followed by histological analysis of the tendons. The main finding of this study was the difference (p < 0.001) in peak contrast enhancement on DCE-MRI, which demonstrated that the operated group had greater contrast uptake. The operated tendons showed histological disruption of their architecture, and cluttered appearance of tendinous fibers, with vascular and fibroblast proliferations. DCE-MRI is a technique with a potential to demonstrate changes in the vascularity pattern of the Achilles tendon before and after operation. DCE-MRI has a potential to be used in studies of tendinosis diagnosis and surgical follow-up. <b><i>Level of evidence II, Experimental Study</i></b> .
