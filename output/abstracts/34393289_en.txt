To determine whether technetium-99m-labeled tropane derivative single-photon emission computed tomography (<sup>99m</sup>Tc-TRODAT-1 SPECT) provides results comparable to those of the less widely available, less accessible tool fluorine-18-labeled fluorodopa positron-emission tomography (<sup>18</sup>F-FDOPA PET) in the setting of a movement disorders clinic. In this prospective pilot study, eight subjects with a clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease were randomly selected from among patients under treatment at a movement disorders clinic and submitted to <sup>99m</sup>Tc-TRODAT-1 SPECT and <sup>18</sup>F-FDOPA PET. The results were read by two experienced observers, and a semiquantitative analysis was performed. The visual and semiquantitative analyses were concordant for all studies, showing that radiotracer uptake in the contralateral striatum on the most affected side was lower when <sup>99m</sup>Tc-TRODAT-1 SPECT was employed. The semiquantitative analysis demonstrated a significant correlation between <sup>18</sup>F-FDOPA PET and <sup>99m</sup>Tc-TRODAT-1 SPECT (r = 0.73; <i>p</i> < 0.01). It appears that <sup>99m</sup>Tc-TRODAT-1 SPECT is a valid option for the study of dopaminergic function in a clinical setting.
