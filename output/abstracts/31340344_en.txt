to represent the dynamics of stress generation, accumulation and reduction in the nursing team at an oncology therapy center. a mathematical simulation model of system dynamics was developed based on data collection in loco. The model served to test the impact of three policies aimed at reducing stress in the team, namely i) increase in the service load; ii) increase in the size of shift teams and iii) reduction of service hours per bed. the model showed that the policy of increasing the size of the team obtained the best results, with the absenteeism index stabilizing at 8%; staff at leave also stabilizing at 4-5 people per month, as well as accumulated stress reduced to baseline levels. measures to monitor physical and emotional demands, hiring staff, better technical training for so-called stressful activities, and a better distribution of tasks can be effective in reducing absenteeism rates and improving the quality of life of these workers.
