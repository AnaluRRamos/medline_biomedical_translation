To assess the prevalence of dental visits and its associated factors during prenatal care. This was a cross-sectional study based on interviews conducted with puerperal women in 31 hospitals covered by the Brazilian National Health System (SUS) in Santa Catarina, Brazil, 2019. Sociodemographic, economic and prenatal-related data were collected. Multivariate analyses were performed using logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (OR). 3,580 puerperal women and 41.4% (95% confidence interval [95%CI] 39.7;43%) underwent dental visits during prenatal care. Higher chance of dental visits was associated with higher education level (OR=1.35 - 95%CI 1.06;1.71) and a higher number of medical/nursing consultations (OR= 1.97 - 95%CI 1.47;2.65); this chance decreased when the puerperal women did not have paid work (OR=0.82 - 95%CI 0.70;0.96) and did not take part in education activities offered by the SUS (OR=0.63 - 95%CI 0.52;0.77). Factors related to schooling, employment, prenatal care and education activities increased the chance of dental visits during pregnancy in Santa Catarina State.
