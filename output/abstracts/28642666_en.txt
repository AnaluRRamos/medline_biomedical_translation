To describe shoulder disorders in patients evaluated by two shoulder and elbow surgeons. This cross-sectional study analyzed patients evaluated by two authors, excluding acute fractures and dislocations and patients with symptoms not involving the shoulder. Age and sex distribution was determined for the different diagnoses. We evaluated 1001 patients. Mean age was 51.43Â±15.15 years and 51.0% were female. Disorders of the rotator cuff occurred in 64.3% (41.2% tendinopathy, 11.0% partial tears and 12.2% full-thickness tears). Adhesive capsulitis occurred in 13.5% of cases and glenohumeral instability in 8.1%. Rotator cuff disorders were more common in women, with a peak between 50 and 59 years for tendinopathy and partial tears and between 60 and 69 years for full-thickness tears. Glenohumeral instability was more frequent in men, with a peak between 30 and 39 years. The most frequent diagnosis was rotator cuff tendinopathy, followed by adhesive capsulitis, full-thickness rotator cuff tears, partial rotator cuff tears and glenohumeral instability. Rotator cuff lesions were more common in women, with a peak between 60 and 69 years for full-thickness tears. <b><i>Level of Evidence IV, Case Series.</i></b>
