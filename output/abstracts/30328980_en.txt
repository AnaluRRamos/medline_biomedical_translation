To identify caregivers' level of burden and analyze the factors associated with family care in mental health. A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted between January and July 2016. A sample of caregivers from seven public institutions and an association of relatives and patients was evaluated by identifying their burden and the contributing factors for reduction of these levels through the Zarit Burden Inventory instrument. The study was conducted according to recommendations of the ethics committees of the participating institutions. Participation of 107 caregivers. The main contributions refer that caregivers' active participation in associative dynamics, their attendance at psychoeducational activities and territorial connection to metropolitan areas with community resources decrease their level of burden. Community nursing is highly important and responsible for preventing levels of burden and increasing health levels. In addition, many proposals are formulated in order to favor social support networks by combining treatments and increasing public health programs in contact with the community.
