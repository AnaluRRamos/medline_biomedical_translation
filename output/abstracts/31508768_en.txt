This study aimed to estimate the incidence of falls among the elderly and to determine the predictive factors of falls and recurrent falls. This is a longitudinal study (2014-2016) conducted with 345 elderly in the urban area of Uberaba-MG. A structured tool related to socioeconomic data and occurrence of falls, Katz and Lawton-Brody Scales, the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) and Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) Brazil were used. The multinomial logistic regression analysis was performed (p < 0.05). The incidence of falls in the follow-up period was 37.1%, with 20% recurrent falls and 17.1% single-event falls. The final model showed that the increase in one SPPB unit decreased by approximately 15% and 17%, respectively, the probability of falls and recurrent falls. The highest FES-I Brazil score was associated with a higher occurrence of recurrent falls. The results found on the occurrence of falls and recurrent falls and their association with worse physical performance and fear of falling provide subsidies for actions directed to the monitoring and control of the interfering factors.
