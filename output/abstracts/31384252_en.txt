To evaluate the relationship between the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) and the Human Development Index (HDI), by region of the world in the period 2010-2015. International Diabetes Federation data were used for DM2 prevalence (2010-2015), together with HDI data (United Nations Development Program). Spearman linear correlations between HDI data and DM2 prevalence were analyzed, and linear regressions were done to estimate the relationship between the two. It was observed that lower HDI scores corresponded to lower DM2 prevalence rates, and higher HDI scores to higher DM2 prevalence. At the global level, the HDI explains the 8.6% variance of DM2 prevalence (P < 0.0001) and shows that the situation was different in each region of the world. While HDI score may be associated with DM2 prevalence, the relationship between them differs from region to region and from country to country, and depends on the particular year analyzed.
