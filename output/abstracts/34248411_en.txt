Imaging plays a key role in the preoperative diagnosis, surgical planning, and postsurgical assessment of the foot, ankle, and knee pathologies. Interpreting diagnostic imaging accurately is crucial for the clinical practice of orthopedic surgeons. Although among the most used imaging modalities, radiographic assessments are amenable to errors for various technical reasons and superposition of bones. Computed tomography (CT) is a conventional imaging procedure that provides high-resolution images, but fails in considering a truly weight-bearing (WB) condition. In an attempt to overcome this limitation, WB cone beam CT technology has being successfully employed in the clinical practice for the past decade. Besides economically viable and safe, the WB cone beam CT considers WB conditions and provides high-quality scans, thus allowing an equitable and correct interpretation. This review aims to address extensive description and discussion on WBCT, including imaging quality; costs; time consumption; and its applicability in common foot, ankle, and knee, conditions. With this technology increasing popularity, and considering the extensive literature on medical research, radiologists and orthopedic surgeons need to understand its potential applications and use it optimally. <b><i>Level of Evidence III, Systematic review of level III studies.</i></b>
