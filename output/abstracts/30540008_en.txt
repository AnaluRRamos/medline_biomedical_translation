This paper aims at proposing validated principles to underpin clinical management as a means to transform healthcare for integrated healthcare systems. The starting point was the conception of clinical management based on structuring elements that do not separate management, care and education. The authors' proposal was submitted to specialists so that a consensus could be reached. At the end of the process, the following principles of clinical management were presented: (1) Focus on health needs and comprehensive care, (2) Quality and safety in healthcare, (3) Articulation and legitimation of different health practices and types of knowledge to face health problems, (4) Power sharing and co-accountability among managers, health professionals and citizens in healthcare production; (5) Education of people and organizations; (6) Focus on outcomes that add value to health and life; (7) Transparency and accountability regarding collective interests. It is concluded that the principles of clinical management express connections that shed new light on management, healthcare, and education in integrated healthcare systems, requiring critical awareness in relation to the simultaneity of 'permanence' and change in practices.
