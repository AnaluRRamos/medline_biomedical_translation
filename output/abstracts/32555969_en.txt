Civil violence is responsible for 2.5% of deaths worldwide; it killed more people in the 21st century than the sum of all wars. This study describes violence victims treated at a trauma reference hospital in Salvador, Brazil and analyzes the impact of different types of interpersonal violence. Interpersonal violence victims admitted between July 2015 and July 2017 were included. The 1,296 patients (mean age: 30.3 years; 90% male) were divided into three groups according to the mechanism of interpersonal violence: 1) beating, 2) firearm injury and 3) stab wound (STW) injury. The groups were compared for the following variables: age, gender, trauma mechanism, Revised Trauma Score (RTS) at admission, need for intensive care unit (ICU) attention, length of hospital stay, need for transfusion of blood products and death. Gunshot wounds (GSW) were the primary mechanism of injury (59%), followed by beating (24%) and STW (17%). Gunshot wound victims had a lower mean RTS upon admission, increased need for blood products and more Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions. Beating victims had the longest mean hospital stay (11.6 Â± 19.6 days). The GSW group accounted for 77.4% of all deaths. The in-hospital mortality rate was significantly higher in the GSW group (12.7%) than in the beating group (5.4%) and in the STW group (4.9%). Gunshot wound victims are more critical: they require longer ICU stays, more transfusions of blood products and exhibit increased mortality compared with STW and beating victims.
