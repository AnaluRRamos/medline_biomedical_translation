The integration of family farming with school meals has the potential to improve the variety of school menus thereby bringing the production and consumption of food into closer alignment. This study researched the Brazilian municipalities with respect to the purchase of food from family farms for the National School Food Program. It involved a cross-sectional study conducted via an electronic questionnaire sent to 5,565 municipalities in the country. The research included 93.2% of the municipalities (n = 5,184), 78.5% of which acquired food from family farms, with the highest frequency (95.5%) of the municipalities making the purchase in the southern region, and the lowest (67.9%) in the Central West region. The large-scale municipalities, with mixed, decentralized or outsourced school food management, and without a nutritionist as technical manager, purchased food less frequently from family farms. The conclusion reached is that, despite the widespread acquisition of food from family farms in the program throughout the country, 50% of municipalities did not invest the minimum required by law, requiring actions aimed at compliance with legislation and greater investment, especially in states and regions which revealed the greatest difficulties.
