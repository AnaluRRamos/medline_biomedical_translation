Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a preventable condition reported in 6.5 to 11 per 100 000 cases of measles, and highest in children who contracted measles infection when they were less than 5 years of age. Children residing in areas with poor vaccination coverage and high prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus are at increased risk of developing SSPE. SSPE is life-threatening in most affected children. This report documents current data relating to the clinical phenotype, epidemiology, and understanding of SSPE, inclusive of preventive interventions. While improvements in disease progression with immunomodulation may occur, overall there is no cure. Most therapies focus on supportive needs. Seizures and abnormal movements may respond to carbamazepine. Many countries advocate policies to enhance vaccination coverage. Effective preventive health care programmes, assurance of parental perceptions, and crisis support for unprecedented events obstructing effective primary health care are needed. Until measles is eradicated worldwide, children in all regions remain at risk. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Measles contracted under 5 years of age has highest risk of developing subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). Children with, or exposed to, human immunodeficiency virus infection, who contract measles may be at increased risk of SSPE.
