The Moroccan school system suffers from recurring dysfunctions as reported by the National Evaluation Body (NEB). These results lead to the degradation of learning and academic performance, in which several factors come into play. In Morocco, studies focusing on the neurocognitive profile of students and its influence on school performance are very limited or rare. In this context, the present study aims to study the role of working memory in school performance among Moroccan high school students. our sample contains 146 high school students. A total of 78 boys and 68 girls participated in this study and the numerical version of The Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure test (ROCF) was used to assess working memory. Moreover, school performance is represented in this study by the mean obtained during the first semester. the results of multiple linear regression revealed that working memory significantly explains variation in school performance. neuropsychological abilities, particularly working memory, significantly explain the deterioration in school performance of students reported by the National Evaluation Body.
