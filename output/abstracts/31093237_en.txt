To determine the magnitude and characteristics of the omission of causes of maternal death in death certificates in Argentina, and to re-estimate the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) for the year 2014. Cross-sectional study. Retrospective review of medical records of women of childbearing age who died from causes suspected of concealing maternal deaths in public, social security, and private institutions in all jurisdictions of the country between 1 January and 31 December 2014. The cause of death recorded in the death certificate was reclassified. Outcome measures included: percentage of records with an omission, structure of causes of death, location, time of death with respect to the reproductive process, and gestational age. The RMM was re-estimated on the basis of the results. Of a sample of 1,176 cases, 969 medical records (82.4%) were analyzed, identifying 60 cases in which the cause of maternal death was omitted (48 maternal deaths, 12 late maternal deaths). Omissions were found in 14.2% of maternal deaths and 33.3% of late maternal deaths. The new estimated MMR for 2014 varied between 43.3 and 47.2 deaths per 100,000 live births. The omission of causes of maternal death in death certificates in Argentina may be less frequent than international agencies have reported, with differences in omission between regions. Efforts must be made to emphasize the importance of filling out death certificates correctly.
