The study aimed to verify the validity of secondary data in the investigation of the food environment and to analyze the characteristics of the community environment and consumers in territories covered by a health promotion service. This was an ecological study in 18 units of the Health Academy Program in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil, selected by simple cluster sampling. Validation of the establishments marketing fruits and vegetables, obtained from public databases, was done via telephone contact, Google Street View, and on-site audit. The following variables were investigated in the community food environment: type and location of the establishment; consumer's environment: availability, variety, price, and advertising of fruits and vegetables; availability and variety of ultra-processed foods; and hygienic and sanitary conditions. The access to healthy foods index was used to measure access to these foods. The on-site audit revealed weak concordance (45.7%) with the secondary databases. Of the 298 establishments, the majority were bulk grocery stores and open-air markets (61.3%), which showed the highest availability of healthy foods, but also marketed large amounts of ultra-processed foods (60.7%). One-third of the establishments showed substandard hygienic and sanitary conditions. The secondary databases showed low validity, emphasizing the need to audit the establishments. The establishments also showed a striking presence of ultra-processed foods and poor hygiene and sanitation.
