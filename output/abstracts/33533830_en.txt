To evaluate speech intelligibility and dysarthria, correlated to the functional assessment of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Quantitative-descriptive study approved by REC under No. CAAE 62912416.4.0000.5404, comprised of 19 individuals with sporadic or familiar ALS. Data were collected using the Dysarthria Protocol and the Revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-Re). We used visual analogue scale (VAS) to assess speech intelligibility and summary measures; and Spearman's coefficients of correlation for the instruments with significance level of 5%. Speech intelligibility is compromised (41.37Â±39.73) in varied degrees with positive correlation with the general degree of dysarthria (p=<.0001), and with all the analyzed speech parameters, indicating impact on the speech deterioration of the studied group. There is negative correlation between speech intelligibility and the results of the bulbar sections - speech and deglutition (p=0.0166), arm - activities with the upper limb (p=0.0064) and leg - activities with the lower limb (p=0.0391). Breathing (p=0.0178), phonation (p=0.0334) and resonance (p=0.0053) parameters showed a negative correlation with the item 'speech' of the ALSFRS-Re. Results show impaired speech intelligibility and dysarthria, and evidence breathing, phonation and resonance as important markers of the disease progression. A thorough and early evaluation of the oral motor production allows for a better management of alterations in ALS.
