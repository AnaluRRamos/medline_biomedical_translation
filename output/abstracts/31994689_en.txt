This illustrated article presents the Darcy Vargas Fishing School, a department at the philanthropic institution Abrigo do Cristo Redentor do Rio de Janeiro, and its importance in the context of the Estado Novo period in Brazil. Established on the island of Marambaia in the early 1940s, the school provided technical and professional training for fishermen from the local area and from different parts of the Brazilian coast, contributing to the emergence of 'worker/citizens' capable of contributing to the socioeconomic development envisaged by President Vargas for the 'National State.'
