To identify and correlate vocal fatigue and voice-related quality of life in university professors and verify possible differences between genders. This is a cross-sectional, observational, and analytical study approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the institution under number 1,708,786. The Voice Fatigue Index (VFI) and the Voice Related Quality of Life (VRQOL) were applied to 126 university professors, 71 women and 55 men, with an average age of 43 years. Scores were calculated using the formula for each protocol and statistical analysis was performed using Spearman's Correlation. Regarding the VFI, the average score found for factors 1, 2 and 3 were 13.78, 4.05 and 7.93, respectively. As for VRQOL, professors had an average global score of 91.90; 88.49 for the physical domain and 97.02 for the socioemotional domain. There was a negative weak to strong correlation between the protocols. There was no statistical difference between genders for both VFI and VRQOL. University professors have good levels of voice related quality of life, but self-reported vocal fatigue, with no differences between genders. The lower the vocal fatigue is, the higher is the voice related quality of life, and vice versa.
