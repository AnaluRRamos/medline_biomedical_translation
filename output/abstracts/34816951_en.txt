This study aimed to describe the scenario of workplace safety and health (WSH) based on the component of the Occupational Safety and Health Management System (SGSST), the identification and control of occupational hazards, and the Colombian legislation on WSH for micro businesses, focusing on the commercial and services sectors in the Los Naranjos neighborhood in Itagüí, Antioquia, Colombia. The study followed a descriptive design with voluntary participation by 50 micro businesses. A three-phase questionnaire was used: theoretical review, expert validation, and pilot study. The questionnaire included the company's characteristics, components of the SGSST, WSH legislation, and hazard management, which included the identification and control of hazards. 88% of the micro businesses do not assign a specific person to manage the SGSST, and 72% do not permanently enroll their workers in the Comprehensive General Social Security System. Physical and chemical hazards are not identified and controlled consistently in 34% and 38% of the micro businesses, respectively. On average, 93.86% of the micro businesses are not aware of the Colombian legislation on WSH. The WSH scenario in a small sector of commercial and services businesses is not encouraging in terms of the SGSST, hazard management, and adequacy and implementation of Colombian laws on WSH, which are mandatory for workers' care.
