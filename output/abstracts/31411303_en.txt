In order to reform Portugal's primary health care (PHC), the Ministry of Health planned a change that was launched in 2005 and 2006, and which is still under way today. This article aims to analyze PHC reform in Portugal according to different phases in its development, using Kingdon's multiple streams model to reflect on the evolution in the reform process and its future, from the perspective of a process that seeks to achieve universal access to health. The working methodology was a document and case study with a qualitative approach and evaluative dimensions. The study was based on material on PHC in Portugal, published both in Portugal and elsewhere. Kingdon's multiple streams model was used to explain the actual and contextual development of policies implemented during the PHC reform. Three phases were identified in the reform, each lasting about five years. The first phase, starting in 2005, featured family health units with a voluntary basis. The second phase began in 2010, with the model's consolidation. In the third phase, since 2015 and still under way, the model came of age, benefiting from the end of the financial crisis but still suffering from its effects. The three reform cycles represent three distinct periods with consistency in the coalition that the policymaker was able to establish, in which the windows of opportunity for internally built change were heavily influenced by external factors. The article identifies the contribution by PHC reform to improvement of the Portuguese population's health status.
