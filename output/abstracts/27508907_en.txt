to understand the context of care addressed to the families involved in family violence against children and adolescents (IVCA), as produced in the context of the Primary Health Care (PHC), from the vantage point of the practitioners of a municipality in the State of Sao Paulo. qualitative research of the social-strategic type, based on the Complexity Paradigm. The participants were 41 health practitioners in five health units of the municipality under study, pertaining to the five districts of the municipality. Data collection was done through 5 focus groups and 10 semi-structured interviews from April 24th 2013 to December 12th 2013. Data analysis was oriented by the comprehension and contextualization mindset and based on the dialogic, recursive and hologramatic principles. two main issues regarding the care provided by the Health of the Family team were identified: the context of this violence (the domestic space) and the power relations that prevail in the territory where this violence surfaces. The community health workers are the targets of specific attention because they experience the live/work dialogic in this same area. paying attention to the territory, and considering the complexity of contexts and dimensions is inherently linked to the design of care to families involved in IVCA in the PHC environment.
