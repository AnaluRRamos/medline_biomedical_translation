Increased longevity has made progression in the number of fractures increasingly significant. Because hip fractures give rise to high morbidity and mortality rates and have high treatment costs, their occurrence is the most important marker of effectiveness in relation to osteoporosis treatment. In countries and systems that, especially over the last decade, have been investing in the prevention of osteoporosis and its consequences, the number of hip fractures has been decreasing. What these countries have in common is secondary prevention of fractures, i.e. to avoid subsequent fractures. Given that half of the patients who present hip fractures have had a previous fracture and that the treatments available have proven to be extremely efficient for decreasing subsequent fractures, a good proportion of hip fractures are preventable. It is within this scenario that orthopedists play a leading role.
