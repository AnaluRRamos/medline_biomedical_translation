Diffuse cardiac fibrosis is an important factor in the prognostic assessment of patients with ventricular dysfunction. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) native T1 mapping is highly sensitive and considered an independent predictor of all-cause mortality and heart failure (HF) development in patients with cardiomyopathy. To evaluate the feasibility of native T1 mapping assessment in patients with HF in a cardiology referral hospital and its association with structural parameters and functional profile. Cross-sectional study with adult patients with HF NYHA functional classes I and II, ischemic and non-ischemic, followed in a referral hospital, who underwent CMR. Native T1 values were analyzed for structural parameters, comorbidities, etiology, and categorization of HF by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Analyses were performed with a significance level of 5%. Enrollment of 134 patients. Elevated native T1 values were found in patients with greater dilation (1004.9 vs 1042.7ms, p = 0.001), ventricular volumes (1021.3 vs 1050.3ms, p <0.01) and ventricular dysfunction (1010.1 vs 1053.4ms, p <0.001), also present when the non-ischemic group was analyzed separately. Patients classified as HF with reduced ejection fraction had higher T1 values than those with HF and preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF) (992.7 vs 1054.1ms, p <0.001). Of those with HFPEF, 55.2% had higher T1. CMR T1 mapping is feasible for clinical HF evaluation. There was a direct association between higher native T1 values and lower ejection fraction, and with larger LV diameters and volumes, regardless of the etiology of HF.
