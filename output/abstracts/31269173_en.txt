Since its creation in 1988, major changes have been made to Brazil's public health system in response to the epidemiological transition and the country's changing economic context and demographics. This article describes the recent healthcare reform implemented in the federal district's public hospital system. Guided by evidence-based management and a series of regulatory instruments, the reform organized hospital emergency services and secondary outpatient care, regulated health services, and remodeled the organizational structure of the Department of Health. These changes were aimed at promoting integration between health professionals across different levels of care and ensuring the provision of continuing comprehensive care. This approach guarantees efficiency gains in patient treatment, since multifocal and focal professionals work in an integrated manner. By reorganizing work processes and ensuring adequate planning, it was possible to redesign the care model to promote knowledge management and improve access to information and interactivity, thus helping to ensure the provision of quality, value-added care.
