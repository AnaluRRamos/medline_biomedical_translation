This study aimed to assess the impact of programs for prenatal, childbirth, and neonatal care (Mother Owl and Stork Network) on avoidable neonatal mortality in Pernambuco State, Brazil, using the adequacy approach. We analyzed the trend in avoidable neonatal mortality and the impact of these programs on avoidable neonatal mortality in four health regions in the state from 2000 to 2016. The Mortality Information System (SIM) and the Information System on Live Births (SINASC) and official documents were used as the data sources. Deaths were classified according to the Brazilian List of Avoidable Causes of Deaths Via Interventions by the Unified National Health System. Linear regression and joinpoint methods were used to analyze tendencies and identifying turning points in the neonatal mortality curves. There was a sharp drop in avoidable neonatal mortality in the state, especially in early neonatal mortality. Except for the I-Recife region, where there was a downturn in the mortality curves after implementation of the Stork Network, there was no association between the turning points in the curves and the periods with the programs' implementation in the regions. Other factors appear to have led to the improvement of these indicators, such as the expansion of the high-risk network. Strengthening this network can thus help reduce avoidable neonatal deaths, especially early deaths.
