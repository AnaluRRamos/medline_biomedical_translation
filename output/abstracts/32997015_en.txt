To compare living, work and health conditions, with a particular interest in the mental health of Brazilian and Spanish outsourced hospital cleaning workers. This is a cross-sectional, quantitative investigation carried out in two public general hospitals, one in the Brazilian Midwest region of SÃ£o Paulo and the other in the Southwest region of the Iberian Peninsula. In total, 78 Brazilian hospital workers and 39 Spanish hospital workers were interviewed using a script with data on the living conditions, including some validated questionnaires such as the Job Content Questionnaire (JCQ) and Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20). Spanish workers are older, white and with a higher household income, with lower SRQ scores in all realms. Also, they smoke more, have a higher level of visual impairment and allergies, have been working in the same activity longer, with a lower workload and do not hold two jobs. Besides, almost 40% of them consider that their work is autonomous. Brazilian workers are subject to more impoverished living, working and mental health conditions than Spanish workers. Only a few aspects of health conditions were worse among Spanish workers, which may probably be related to their advanced age.
