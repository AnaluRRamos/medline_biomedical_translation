The study aimed to analyze factors associated with uncontrolled asthma in schoolchildren exposed to pesticides in a medium-sized municipality in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil. This was a case-control study of children 6 to 7 and 13 to 14 years old in Primavera do Leste, in 2016. Cases were defined as schoolchildren that met the criteria for uncontrolled asthma based on International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questions, and controls were selected from the same schools as the cases, after randomization, at a 1:1 ratio. Data collection used the questionnaires from Phases I and II of ISAAC and an additional questionnaire on pesticide exposure. Descriptive, bivariate, and logistic da e regression analyses were performed with the individual and environmental sociodemographic, and economic variables. 319 cases and 319 controls were selected, totaling 638 participants in the study. In the final da logistic model, the variables family income greater than 4 minimum wages (OR = 14.36; 95%CI: 8.89-23.20), maternal schooling up to incomplete secondary (OR = 16.32; 95%CI: 8.96-29.75), prematurity (OR = 13.25; 95%CI: 4.83-36.41), and low birthweight (OR = 17.08; 95%CI: 5.52-52.90) remained associated with uncontrolled asthma. Of the pesticide exposure variables, presence of household member working in agriculture (OR = 5.91; 95%CI: 2.11-16.53), living near farming activities (OR = 3.98; 95%CI: 1.47-11.76), and spraying areas near the household (OR = 4.20; 95%CI: 1.49-11.87) were related to the outcome. In this study, pesticides and sociodemographic, neonatal, and childhood conditions proved related to uncontrolled asthma in schoolchildren.
