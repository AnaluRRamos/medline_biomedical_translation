The creation of consensus and agreement among managers of the Unified Health System (SUS) was analyzed in Regional Interagency Commissions of two metropolitan scenarios, by means of a multiple case study for comparative analysis between the Metropolitan Region of Fortaleza-Cear√° and the Metropolitan Region of Salvador-Bahia. The theoretical reference used was based on Mario Testa's work and on Habermas' Theory of Communicative Action. The data production merged documental analysis, interviews with managers of state, municipal and federal levels with direct observation of meetings of the Regional Interagency Commission, the State Health Council, the Bipartite Interagency Commission, meetings between central and regional levels, in addition to extended meetings of the Health Municipal Offices Council, in both states. The problems related to Agreed and Integrated Programming and to the underfunding of SUS were common points in the scenarios studied. Such problems are interlinked and interfere in an important way in the interinstitutional relations between the municipalities, highlighting the dispute for resources as an obstacle for the creation of consensus and agreement, based on the dialogue and understanding between actors.
