Renal artery aneurysms (RAAs) are rare and usually asymptomatic; âˆ¼ 90% of them are unilateral. Once diagnosed during pregnancy, they may rupture, presenting a high maternal-fetal risk. The present study reports the case of a 32-year-old pregnant woman with a 30-week gestational age and a ruptured unilateral RAA.
