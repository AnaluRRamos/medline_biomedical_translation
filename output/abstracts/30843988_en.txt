To analyze the correlation between living will and bioethical aspects, professional performance and patient autonomy. Theoretical reflection after a search conducted in the Virtual Health Library, PubMed and SciELO databases, using the words 'living will', 'right of the patient', 'bioethics', 'personal autonomy' and 'health professional', as well as the corresponding terms in Portuguese. Based on the reading, abstracts that met the proposed objective were selected and full texts were subsequently consulted and read critically to support this reflection. Analyzes led to reflect on bioethics applied to health professional knowledge on the rights of terminally ill patients, as well as their autonomy regarding their living will. 'Living will' is still a poorly understood term that needs greater dissemination and knowledge among health professionals and the population, as it addresses the legitimacy of patient's rights at a crucial moment of human life.
