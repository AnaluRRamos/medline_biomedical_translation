Oral health resolvability in primary care of municipalities in the State of Paraíba, Brazil, was analyzed, and a cross-sectional study was conducted, using an inductive approach, comparative procedure and indirect documentation. The Resolvability Indicator (RI) consisted of the ratio between the number of Completed Treatments and First Programmatic Dental Consultations in municipalities in Paraíba (n = 223), between 2011 and 2014, by using data collected from the DATASUS/TABNET platform. The following explanatory variables were considered: Coverage of First Programmatic Dental Consultation (CFPDC), Coverage of Primary Care Teams (CPCT), Coverage of Oral Health Teams (COHT), Coverage of Family Health Teams (CFHT), Percentage of Tooth Extraction (PTE), Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Municipal Human Development Index (MHDI) and Gini Coefficient (GC). Descriptive statistics and negative binomial multiple regression were performed (α = 0.05). The median RI in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 was, respectively, 20.4, 17.5, 15.2 and 15.7. There was a positive association between RI and CFPDC (PR = 1.14, CI = 1.02-1.28), CPCT (PR = 1.02, CI = 1.01-1.03), in addition to a negative association. between RI and year (PR = 0.83; IC = 0.74-0.94). The resolvability of oral health in primary care is influenced by coverage-related factors.
