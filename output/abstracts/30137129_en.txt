A cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate and compare dietary intake, type of assistance (Basic Health Units - UBS and Family Health Strategies - ESF) and participation in the 'Bolsa Fam√≠lia' Program (PBF) among users of the Brazilian Unified Health System, (SUS). The sample was composed of individuals of both sexes between 18 and 78 years of age in Porto Alegre, state of Rio Grande do Sul. Socioeconomic, clinical and food consumption data were collected via a questionnaire adapted from the SISVAN and VIGITEL national surveys. The analyses were conducted using R3.1 software. Of the 187 patients, 91 were affiliated to the ESF, 96 to UBS and 40 were registered with the PBF. A healthy eating pattern was identified in only 41% of SUS users. It was observed that 55% did not consume raw salad (37% p = 0.04) and vegetable consumption was lower among the PBF users (67.5% versus 75.9%; p = 0.02). There was no significant difference in food consumption considering the kind of assistance (ESF or UBS). A healthy consumption pattern was not associated with demographic and socioeconomic variables. The majority of beneficiaries of the PBF did not admit to healthy eating patterns. Therefore, effective health promotion and prevention is needed for this population, mainly among the beneficiaries of the PBF.
