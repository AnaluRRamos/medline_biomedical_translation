To analyze the registry of the Transfer Note (NT) and the emission of the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) performed by the nurse in adult patients transferred from the Emergency Service as an effective communication strategy for patient safety. A cross-sectional retrospective study developed at a teaching hospital in the South of Brazil that evaluated 8028 electronic medical records in the year 2017. A descriptive analysis was performed. NT reached the institutional target of 95% in January and February, falling below the target in other months. The MEWS measurement was performed in 85.6% (n = 6,870) of the medical records. Of these patients, 96.8% (n = 6,652) had unchanged MEWS. NT and MEWS are inserted in the work of the nurse, however, actions are needed to qualify patient safety, improving effective communication and therefore reducing the possibility of occurrence of adverse events.
