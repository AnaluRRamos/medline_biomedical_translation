Analyze the probability of specific survival and factors associated with the risk of death of patients with prostate cancer who received outpatient cancer treatment in the Brazilian Unified Health System, Brazil. Retrospective cohort study using the National Database of Oncology, developed through the deterministic-probabilistic pairing of health information systems: outpatient (SIA), hospital (SIH) and mortality (SIM). The probability of overall and specific survival was estimated by the time elapsed between the date of the first ambulatory treatment, from 2002 to 2003, until the patient's death or the end of the study. Fine and Gray's model of competing-risks regression was adjusted according to the variables: age of diagnostic, region of residence, tumor clinical staging, type of outpatient cancer treatment and hospitalization in the assessment of factors associated with risk of patient death. Of 16,280 patients studied, the average age was 70 years, approximately 25% died due to prostate cancer and 20% for other causes. The probability of overall survival was 0.50 (95%CI 0.49-0.52) and the specific was 0.70 (95%CI 0.69-0.71). The factors associated with the risk of patient death were: stage III (HR = 1.66; 95%CI 1.39-1.99) and stage IV (HR = 3.49; 95%CI 2.91-4.18), chemotherapy (HR = 2.34; 95%CI 1.76-3.11) and hospitalization (HR = 1.6; 95%CI 1.55-1.79). The late diagnosis of the tumor, palliative treatments, and worse medical condition were factors related to the worst survival and increased risk of death from prostate cancer patients in Brazil.
