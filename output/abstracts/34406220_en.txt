To analyze the effect of sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of new leprosy cases as determinants in the performance of the evaluation of their contacts. This was a cross-sectional study, with a temporal approach to the evaluation indicator of 100% of contacts examined of each new case (NC) registered in the state of Cear√°, Brazil, on the Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN), in 2008-2019. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). The temporal trends were analyzed using joinpoint regression. 23,675 NCs, 65.4% with contacts examined were analyzed. It was less likely to evaluate 100% of the registered contacts when the new cases were multibacillary (OR=1.19 - 95%CI 1.11;1.28) and with examination of contacts as an entry mode (OR=1.71 - 95%CI 1.35;2.18). There was an increasing temporal trend of the indicator (Annual Percentage Change: 2.1 - 95%CI 1.2;3.0). Distinct dimensions of individual and social vulnerability among new leprosy cases influenced the persistent unsatisfactory performance of the evaluation of contacts.
