to estimate the prevalence of use of psychotropic medicines and associated factors in adults and elderly, and to identify the main classes used. cross-sectional population-based study, conducted in Campinas-SP, Brazil (January/2008-April/2009); chi-square Rao-Scott test and Poisson multiple regression were applied. the study included 2,472 individuals and the prevalence of use of at least one psychotropic medication in the three previous days was 6.8% (95%CI 5.5;8.1); in the adjusted analyses, there were positive associations between use and female sex (PR=1.48; 95%CI 1.01;2.18), worse health perception (PR=2.10; 95%CI 1.13;3.89), common mental disorder (PR=1.66; 95%CI 1.09;2.51) and emotional problems (PR=8.04; 95%CI 4.87;13.02); black/brown-skinned individuals presented significantly lower use (PR=0.58; 95%CI 0.39;0.88); antidepressants (52.6%), anxiolytics (28.1%) and antipsychotics (17.0%) were the most used. inequalities regarding sex and ethnicity/skin color were observed; the findings contribute to the evaluation of the rational use of these drugs.
