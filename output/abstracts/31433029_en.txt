This study aimed to describe the characteristics, distribution, and mortality rates from suicide in indigenous children in Brazil compared to non-indigenous children. This descriptive study covered the years from 2010 to 2014, using national databases. The study collected deaths in individuals 10 to 14 years of age whose underlying cause was 'inentional self-inflicted injury'. Hanging was the most frequently used means in both indigenous and non-indigenous children, although it was more frequent in the former. Among indigenous children, suicides in hospitals or other healthcare establishments were less common than in non-indigenous. Approximately three-fourths of suicides in indigenous children occurred in just 17 municipalities. The mortality rate from suicide among indigenous children was 11.0/100,000 (8.4-14.3), or 18.5 times higher (10.9-31.6) than in non-indigenous, which was 0.6/100,000 (0.5-0.6), with no differences between boys and girls. This study showed for the first time on a national scale the specific characteristics of suicide in indigenous children, with high rates, and also identified priority areas for interventions.
