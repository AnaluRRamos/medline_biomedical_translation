It is well-known that insulin resistance and hyperglycemia are important pathological causes for the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). However, its precise molecular mechanisms in the pathogenesis of DCM remain unclear. Recent studies reveal that microRNAs (miRNA) play essential roles in the pathogenesis of DCM. This project aimed to determine the roles of miR-34a and miR-125b in hyperglycemia-induced cardiomyocyte cell death. Rat primary cardiomyocytes were isolated and exposed to normal and high concentrations of glucose. Cell viability was measured using MTT assay. Expressions of miR-34a and miR-125b were detected by qRT-PCR. Potential targets of miR-34a and miR-125b were predicted from www.Targetscan.org and validated from human heart tissues. A statistical significance of p<0.05 was considered. The present study shows that miR-34a and miR-125b are downregulated in a human diabetic heart. Moreover, in vitro data from rat primary cardiomyocytes showed that short-term high glucose treatment stimulates miR-34a and miR-125b expressions. Under high glucose, it was found that rat cardiomyocytes displayed increased intracellular glucose metabolism, and glucose uptake and lactate production were significantly increased. It was also found that the key glucose metabolic enzymes, Hexokinase 2 (HK2) and Lactate dehydrogenase-A (LDHA), were direct targets of miR-125b and miR-34a, respectively. Overexpression of miR-125b and miR-34a could prevent hyperglycemia-induced cardiomyocyte cell death. Finally, the restoration of HK2 and LDHA in miR-125b and miR-34a overexpressed cardiomyocytes recovered the cardiomyocytesâ€™ sensitivity to hyperglycemia. Our results proposed a molecular mechanism for the microRNA-mediated diabetic cardiovascular protection and will contribute to developing treatment strategies for diabetes-associated cardiovascular dysfunction.
