to evaluate the influence of the site of trauma occurrence on the trauma scores of patients submitted to emergency laparotomy. this is a retrospective, observational, analytical study. We included 212 patients who underwent exploratory laparotomies in the period of January 2015 and December 2017. We obtained information about the accident site and vital data of the patients based on data collection through electronic and physical records. We analyzed the trauma indices of patients from Curitiba and its Metropolitan Region and the place where the patient was rescued (physical establishment or public road). among the 212 patients studied, 184 (86.7%) were brought by the Prehospital Care Service from the city of Curitiba, and 28 (13.3%), from the Metropolitan Region of Curitiba. Twenty-five patients (17.6%) were rescued in physical establishments, while 117 (82.4%) were rescued on public roads. We observed higher values ​​of Injurity Severity Scores (ISS) in patients coming from the Metropolitan Region than in those coming from Curitiba (29.78 vs 22.46, P=0.009), but higher values ​​of Trauma and Injury Severity Scores (TRISS) in patients from Curitiba than the ones from the Metropolitan Region (90.62 vs 81.30, P=0.015). Patients rescued in public roads presented lower Revised Trauma Scores (RTS) (6.96 vs 7.65, P=0.024) and TRISS (86.42 vs 97.21; P=0.012). trauma victims from sites more distant from the referral center and rescued on public roads presented worse prognosis.
