To describe health-related quality of life (HRQoL), pain, fatigue, and other health variables in young adults with cerebral palsy (CP), and to explore associations with the Gross Motor Function Classification System - Expanded and Revised (GMFCS-ER) and physical activity. This was a cross-sectional study of 61 young adults at a mean age of 21 years 2 months (standard deviation 8mo, range 20-22y) with CP, from a geographically defined area. Data collection included: Short Form 36 version 2 for HRQoL, Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form, Fatigue Severity Scale, level of physical activity, medical history, and physical examination. Overall HRQoL equalled that of population norms; however self-reported physical health was lower in GMFCS-ER levels III to V compared to GMFCS-ER levels I to II. Self-reported mental health was, inversely, lower in GMFCS-ER levels I to II compared to GMFCS-ER levels III to V. Pain prevalence was 49%, and pain was present across all GMFCS-ER levels. Fatigue, as well as sleep problems, had 41% prevalence, with fatigue severity decreasing with increasing level of physical activity. General HRQoL in young adults with CP was comparable to population norms. Pain and fatigue are important to address in high motor-functioning individuals also. Physical activity could be a possible protective factor against fatigue. Health-related quality of life in young adults with cerebral palsy (CP) was comparable to population norms. Pain, fatigue, and sleep problems occurred at all Gross Motor Function Classification System levels. There is a possible protective effect of physical activity on fatigue.
