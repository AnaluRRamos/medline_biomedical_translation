The implementation of educational actions, including sexual violence prevention, aimed to promoting the sexual rights of young individuals with intellectual disabilities, can be characterized as a huge challenge in the services that assist this population. This article aims to validate, with expert judges, educational technology aimed at sexual abuse prevention among young individuals with ID. This is a content and display validation study, performed with 25 judges. The information was collected through a questionnaire, considering the domains: objective, relevance, structure and presentation. The quantitative data were analyzed using the Content Validation Index (CVI) and a cutoff point of 0,80 was adopted, while qualitative data were submitted to thematic content analysis. An educational technology 'Abuse no more: learning to protect yourself', was subsidized by Vigotsky's theoretical framework and consists of a set of materials, including a storybook and support resources (dolls, booklet and explanatory video). This technology was validated by the judges, with a total CVI of 0,99, obtaining a CVI >0,95 in all items and domains. The judges highlighted the relevant and innovative nature of the technology, offering suggestions for its improvement.
