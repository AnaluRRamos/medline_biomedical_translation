Since two decades we witnessed the publication of several studies devoted to the study of the influence of the presence of hydrosalpinx on the results of embryo transfer techniques. The aim of this study is to present the results of treatment and pregnancy outcomes in women with a history of infertility associated with unilateral hydrosalpinx, visible on vaginal ultrasound, which were subjected to unilateral occlusion with Essure速 and subsequent treatment with in vitro fertilization. We performed a prospective analysis of a sample of 6 women, with a history of infertility and unilateral hydrosalpinx, between April 2010 to May 2013. In all cases we proceeded to unilateral hysteroscopic placement of the Essure速 microinsert, prior to performing a cycle for in vitro fertilization. Of the 6 patients undergoing in vitro fertilization, 4 became pregnant (66.7%). Of these, two were uneventful pregnancies until delivery and 2 are still under surveillance, without complications. Of the patients who did not become pregnant after in vitro fertilization (n = 2, 33.3%), 1 conceived spontaneously during the subsequent monitoring. The advancement of hysteroscopy in the treatment of hydrosalpinx using the Essure速 microinsert placement is a valid alternative to the laparoscopic approach. This study suggests the effectiveness of unilateral tubal occlusion caused by Essure速 microinsert in improving outcomes of in vitro fertilization treatment in cases of infertility associated with unilateral hydrosalpinx, visible in the vaginal ultrasound.
