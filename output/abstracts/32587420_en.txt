To assess trends and predictors of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) after renal mass cryoablation in patients with and without history of renal impairment. This was a retrospective study of 39 patients who underwent computed tomography-guided percutaneous cryoablation of a renal mass, divided into two groups: those with prior renal impairment (PRI+); and those without prior renal impairment (PRI-). The GFR trend and the chronic kidney disease stage were evaluated at baseline, as well as at 1, 6, and 12 months after cryoablation. Predictors of GFR at 1 and 6 months were modeled with linear regression. In both groups, the mean GFR at 1 month and 6 months was significantly lower than at baseline (<i>p</i> < 0.001 and <i>p</i> = 0.01, respectively). Although the GFR was lower across all time points in the PRI+ group (-26.1; <i>p</i> < 0.001), the overall trend was not statistically different from that observed in the PRI- group (<i>p</i> = 0.89). Univariate analysis showed that the decline in GFR at 1 and 6 months correlated with the baseline GFR (0.77 and 0.63; <i>p</i> < 0.001 and <i>p</i> = 0.03, respectively) and with the size of the ablation zone (-7.6 and -12.84, respectively; <i>p</i> = 0.03 for both). However, in the multivariate model, baseline GFR was predictive only of GFR at 1 month (<i>p</i> < 0.001). The trend in GFR decline after cryoablation is similar for patients with and without a history of renal impairment. Baseline GFR predicts the mean GFR in the early post-cryoablation period.
