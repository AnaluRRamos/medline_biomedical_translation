Verify the correlation between two scar assessment scales and the presence of orofacial myofunctional disorders (OMD) in patients with head and neck (H&N) burns. Participants of this study were 16 adult individuals with H&N full-thickness burns. Data were collected through assessment of mandibular range of movement and application of the following instruments: Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS), Vancouver Scar Scale, and Orofacial Myofunctional Evaluation with Scores (OMES). Results showed moderate negative correlation between the variables deglutition, breathing, total score of the functions, total score on the OMES and scores on the scar assessment scales, indicating that the higher (more severe) the scores on these scales, the lower the scores on the items of the OMES (indicative of greater OMD severity). No correlations were observed between the items of the OMES and the POSAS Patient scale. Results suggest that there is correlation between scar severity in burn patients, measured through clinical scales, and presence of OMD. Patients who present scores indicative of H&N pathological scars should be immediately referred to orofacial myofunctional assessment.
