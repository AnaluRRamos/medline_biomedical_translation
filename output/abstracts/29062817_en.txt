To measure the prevalence of primary drug prevention of fractures due to osteoporosis in patients admitted to a tertiary teaching hospital, in a medium-sized city, admitted with osteoporotic fractures. Moreover, to identify the incidence of prescribing secondary prophylaxis after the first fracture event. At the same time, the prevalence of risk factors for such fractures as described in the literature was measured. This longitudinal prospective study was based on a cohort of patients admitted in a tertiary teaching hospital from October 2015 to January 2016. Patients with low energy or fragility fractures were included in the study regardless of gender or race, over the age of 50 years. All patients who did not have these characteristics were excluded. The follow-up lasted four months. Serial questionnaires were applied at admission and in the follow-up consultations at four to eight weeks and at 16 weeks. Only one patient reported receiving treatment with specific drugs for the disease before hospital admission, resulting in a prevalence of primary chemoprophylaxis of only 2.27%. No patient was prescribed medication for the treatment of osteoporosis after the fracture. The prevalence of risk factors was similar to those found in the literature review. In the present study, the frequency of primary and secondary osteoporosis chemoprophylaxis in patients who were admitted with fragility fractures was low, as well as the early indication of drug treatment after the first fracture. The prevalence of fragility fracture risk factors is similar to those reported in the literature.
