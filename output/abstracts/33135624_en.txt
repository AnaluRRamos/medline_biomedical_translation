Percutaneous coronary intervention is a coronary revascularization procedure that may rarely result in thromboembolic events. Although infrequent, ophthalmological complications of percutaneous interventions include a wide range of clinical presentations, with differing severity and outcomes. In this case report, an 83-year-old woman, with multiple cardiovascular risk factors, presents with horizontal diplopia after a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. After ophthalmological evaluation and a head computed tomography scan, the diagnosis of isolated ischemic internuclear ophthalmoplegia was established. After six months of follow-up, the patient showed complete recovery of her symptoms and ocular movements. We discuss the post-percutaneous intervention ophthalmic complications that, although uncommon, must be recognized by health care providers.
