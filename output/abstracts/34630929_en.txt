Zolpidem is one of the most widely prescribed hypnotic (non-benzodiazepine) agents for sleep disorder. Recently, an increase in the demand for this drug has been observed, mainly in the elderly population. This study aims to analyze the acute effect of zolpidem on cognitive and balance dysfunctions in the elderly population. A study was conducted by two independent researchers in four virtual scientific information bases and included randomized controlled trials. The studies evaluated elderly patients using zolpidem. Cognitive and balance dysfunctions were analyzed. Six articles were included. The mean age of the participants in the studies was 69 years. The following zolpidem dosages were evaluated: 5, 6.25, 10, and 12.5 mg. Comparing zolpidem and placebo, relating to the cognitive dysfunctions, there is no statistically significant difference between the groups. However, in relation to balance dysfunctions, there is a statistically significant difference between the intervention and the comparison, favoring placebo. Zolpidem, even in usual doses (5 mg and 10 mg), has shown to increase the risk for balance dysfunctions. However, this does not occur in relation to cognitive changes.
