To evaluate the conduct of Brazilian orthopedists regarding preventive treatment after fragility fracture surgery. A questionnaire was applied to Brazilian orthopedists. Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS 16.0 program. 257 participants were analyzed. Most participants, 90.7% (n = 233), reported that they cared for patients with fractures and 62.3% (n = 160) treated them. The most indicated treatments were vitamin D (22.6%; n = 134) and calcium supplementation (21.4%; n = 127). According to the experience of the physicians - experienced (n = 184) and residents (n = 73) - fragility fractures were more common in the routine of residents (98.6%; n = 72) than experienced physicians (87.5%; n = 161), p = 0.0115. While treatment conduction was more reported by experienced physicians (63.6%; n = 117) than residents (58.9%; n = 43), p = 0.004. More experienced orthopedists (21.4%; n = 97) indicated treatment with bisphosphates than residents (14.2%; n = 20), p = 0.0266. Although most professionals prescribe treatment after fragility fracture surgery, about 40% of professionals still do not treat it, with differences in relation to experience. In this sense, we reinforce the importance of secondary prevention in the management of fragility fractures. <b>Level of Evidence II, Prospective comparative study.</b>
