This review evaluated the outcomes used in clinical studies involving rotator cuff tear published in the last decade in the two leading Brazilian orthopedic journals. A literature review was performed using the journals Revista Brasileira de Ortopedia and Acta Ortop√©dica Brasileira. It included all original clinical articles describing at least one outcome measured before or after any clinical or surgical intervention related to rotator cuff tear, published between 2006 and 2015. The authors evaluated range of motion, muscle strength, patient satisfaction, and tendon integrity and functional outcomes scores. There were 25 clinical studies published about rotator cuff in the two principal Brazilian orthopedic journals in the last decade, 20 case series (80%), one case-control (4%), and four cohorts (16%). Objective measures such as muscle strength, patient satisfaction, and evaluation of tendon integrity were little used. Range of motion measurements were performed in 52% of the articles. Evaluations of muscle strength and patient satisfaction were reported by 28% and 16% of the studies, respectively. Only 28% of the articles evaluated tendon integrity after surgery. Of these, 16% did so by magnetic resonance imaging and 12% by ultrasonography. The most used scale was the UCLA, present in 92% of the articles, while the Constant-Murley appeared in 20%. Scales deemed reliable, with high internal consistency and good responsiveness, were rarely used.
