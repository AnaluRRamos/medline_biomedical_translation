The ductus arteriosus is a fetal structure that spontaneously closes in 90% of newborns. Patency 3 months after birth is considered a congenital heart disease that, if untreated, can progress to serious cardiovascular complications. This report aims to review an alternative treatment with an aortic endoprosthesis in a 49-year-old man who presented with dyspnea on moderate exertion associated with a heart murmur. He was diagnosed with persistent ductus arteriosus (PDA) with cardiac complications. Clinical management was unsuccessful and surgical treatment was indicated. Endovascular treatment with a thoracic endoprosthesis was indicated and performed successfully. Percutaneous closure is the preferred method in adult patients. Endovascular intervention using an endoprosthesis is a safe and effective option, in addition to being applicable regardless of the anatomy of the PDA. This case demonstrates the natural history of the pathology and presents a safe and effective alternative for its management.
