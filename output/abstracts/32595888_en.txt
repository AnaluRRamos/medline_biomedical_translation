Given the aging of the world population, it is essential to investigate which methods are most effective for treating the diseases that manifest with age. This study addresses Parkinson's disease (PD), for which Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) has been increasingly used to treat the disease. To investigate Executive Functions (EF) in patients with and without DBS. A systematic review of the literature was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyzes (PRISMA) criteria. Scientific papers published on the Scopus, Web of Science and PsycInfo databases were selected. 13 articles were selected. Results showed no standardization of instruments used to evaluate EF and that, in most studies, lack of a control group may have affected results. Decline in EF was observed in terms of verbal fluency and processing speed in patients with DBS.
