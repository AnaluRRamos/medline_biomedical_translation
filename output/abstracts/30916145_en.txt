Regular physical activity (PA) generates several health benefits. This study aimed to analyze the predictors of moderate PA (MPA) and vigorous PA (VPA) separately, as well as some health outcomes related to each intensity. A population-based, cross-sectional study, with adults and the elderly in the urban area of the city of Rio Grande, RS, Brazil. PA was collected through the leisure section of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). The cutoff points used for MPA and VPA were, respectively, 150min/wk and 75min/wk. The health conditions analyzed were: obesity, stress, hypertension, diabetes, depression and self-perception of health. A total of 1,290 individuals participated in the study, with a mean age of 46.0 years (SD = 17.3); 14.3% (95%CI 11.7 - 16.8) were classified as active for MPA, and 14.6% (95%CI 12.1 - 17.1) for VPA. Male gender, higher schooling, more favorable perception of the neighborhood and more hours of sleep were associated with higher prevalence of MPA. Males, aged 20 to 39 years, white skin color, absence of smoking, higher schooling and higher index of assets were associated with higher prevalence of VPA. Regarding health outcomes, MPA conferred protection for stress, while VPA was a protective factor for obesity, hypertension, and diabetes. It was observed that both the predictors and the health outcomes differed according to the intensity of the PA.
