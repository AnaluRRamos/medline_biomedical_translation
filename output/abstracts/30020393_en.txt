This study aimed to evaluate the performance of the Family Health Strategy after implementation of the More Physicians Program (MPBP) in the territory of Marajó-Pa-Brazil through an historical series of four primary care indicators during 2011-2015: population coverage, proportion of live births to mothers with/without prenatal consultations, hospitalization rates due to primary care sensitive condition (taxas de internações por condições sensíveis à atenção primária - ICSAP) and infant mortality rate. A trend of improvement was evident after implementation of the MPBP in 2013, achieving 42.8% of coverage in December 2015. In April 2014, all 16 municipalities had established teams with physicians. The proportion of live births to mothers with/without prenatal consultations showed increasing trends in most municipalities, increasing by 97% on average, predominantly with seven consultations or more and reducing the proportion of live births to mothers without prenatal visits. The infant mortality rate achieved a downward trend starting in 2014. The results indicate improvements in primary care based on the selected indicators, boosting the Family Health Strategy (FHS) in the studied region.
