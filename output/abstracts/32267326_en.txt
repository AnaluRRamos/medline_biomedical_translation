The prevalence of obesity has systematically been increased in the population, including children and adolescents, around the world. To describe reference percentile curves for waist circumference (WC) in Brazilian children and provide cut-off values of WC to identify children at risk for obesity. A multicenter, prospective, cross-sectional study was performed with children aged from 6 to 10 years old, enrolled in public and private elementary schools from 13 cities of the SÃ£o Paulo State. Height, weight, and WC were measured in duplicate in 22,000 children (11,199 boys). To establish the WC best cut-off value for obesity diagnosis, ROC curves with children classified as normal weight and obese were calculated, according to BMI curves, stratified by gender and age, and the Youden Index was utilized as the maximum potential effectiveness of this biomarker. A p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. WC values increased with age in both boys and girls. The prevalence of obesity in each age group varied from 17% (6 years old) to 21.6% (9 years old) among boys, and from 14.1% (7 years old) to 17.3 % (9 years old) among girls. ROC analyses have shown the 75<sup>th</sup> percentile as a cut-off for obesity risk, and the diagnosis of obesity is classified on the 85<sup>th</sup> percentile or more. Age and gender specific reference curves of WC for Brazilian children and cut-off values for obesity risk may be used for national screening and interventional studies to reduce the obesity burden in Brazil.
