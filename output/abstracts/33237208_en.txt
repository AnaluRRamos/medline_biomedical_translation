This study aimed to analyze the association between quality of primary healthcare (PHC) in Brazilian municipalities (counties) and the number of hospitalizations due to primary healthcare-sensitive conditions. This was an ecological study with analysis of nationwide secondary data. The quality of the number of hospitalizations due to primary healthcare-sensitive conditions was based on assessment of the National Program for Improvement of Access and Quality of Basic Care (PMAQ-AB). The analysis used a hierarchical explanatory model, with the number of the number of hospitalizations due to primary healthcare-sensitive conditions hospitalizations in the year 2014 as the dependent variable and sociodemographic and health system data as the independent variables. The measure of association between the number of hospitalizations and quality of PHC was calculated with negative binomial regression with robust variance and the total population as offset, with significance set at 20% in the univariate analysis and 5% in the multivariate analysis. The mean number of hospitalizations due to primary healthcare-sensitive conditions admissions during the target period was 359.97 hospitalizations per municipality. The quality of PHC showed a negative association with the number of hospitalizations due to primary healthcare-sensitive conditions admissions. Municipalities with lower quality of PHC (quartile 1) showed 21.2% more number of hospitalizations due to primary healthcare-sensitive conditions admissions than municipalities with higher quality (95%CI: 1.09-1.34). The results showed that quality of PHC in Brazil reduced hospitalizations due to primary healthcare-sensitive conditions, even in contexts of social vulnerability.
