To characterize the scientific production on adolescent health policies and programs in Brazil and Portugal in the period 2010-2017. This is a literature review based on the Scoping Review method. The research guidingquestion was: 'How is the scientific production on adolescent health policies and programs in Brazil and Portugal characterized?'Search was carried out in October 2017 on the BVS, EBSCO and Google Scholar platforms. Twenty-two studies were selected, namely, 17 Brazilian and 5 Portuguese. Seven cross-cutting thematic categories were identified, as follows: policy and program evaluation; health promotion and education; mental health; sexual and reproductive health; violence; oral health and nutritional health. We canconclude that, albeit in different social contexts, the themes reflect traditional areas of intervention of policies and programs, except for those arising from the phenomenon of structural violence, markedly present in the Brazilian reality. Also, the lack of emerging issues such as gender identities, migratory flows, and morbimortality from external causes reveal a possible care gap in policies and programs and a necessary field to be explored.
