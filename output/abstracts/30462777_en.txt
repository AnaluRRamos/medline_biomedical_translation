To analyze the context of drug use in children aged zero to five years old. Cross-sectional study based on interviews conducted at home with caregivers (parents, uncles or grandparents) of the children enrolled in ten Family Health Strategy units across different geographical points of the city of Tubar√£o, Santa Catarina, Brazil. A total of 350 caregivers were interviewed, whose children's mean age was 2.6 years. Of these, 56.9% had used at least one drug in the 15 days prior to the interview, 31.1% had been exposed to self-medication and 35.7% had used at least one medication obtained by current prescription. The use of medication was associated with the age range up to 24 months, periodic consultation with pediatricians and diagnosis of chronic and acute diseases. Among medicated children, 19.1% inappropriately had been exposed to at least one medication (considering dose, dose interval or period of treatment). Regarding medication storage, 55.2% of interviewees stored them in unsafe places that could be accessed by children and 32.0% in inappropriate places, with exposure to light, heat or humidity. Moreover, 45.2% of the interviewees stored drugs out of their packages, 38.9% without secondary packaging, and 1.6% of drugs had expired date. Drug use is high among children in this age range, and actions aimed at the safe and rational use of these substances in this population should be encouraged.
