The forestry sector employs a large number of workers worldwide. To establish the prevalence of dyslipidemia among forestry workers in a pulp and paper company. Cross-sectional and descriptive study with quantitative approach conducted with a sample of 155 forestry machine operations who underwent periodic health examinations in 2013. 45.1% of the participants exhibited sedentary behavior, 18.7% obesity, 52.2% overweight and 36.7% waist circumference within the high-risk range. About 46.5% exhibited HDL <40 mg/dL; 6.5% LDL >160 mg/dL (hypercholesterolemia alone); 38.7% triglycerides >150 mg/dL (hypertriglyceridemia alone); and 3.2% mixed hyperlipidemia. Based on the results we suggest a strategic action plan to revert the status of dyslipidemia and continuously improve the quality of life of this population of workers. Health promotion strategies are needed to improve the quality of life of workers, including orientation on healthy lifestyles and incentives to balanced nutrition and physical activity.
