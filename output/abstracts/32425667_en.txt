To quantify pelvic retroversion during clinical evaluation of hip flexion with accelerometers and to verify the reliability of these sensors to measure hip flexion. An accelerometer was positioned laterally in the pelvis to measure pelvic retroversion. Another accelerometer was positioned anteriorly on the thigh to evaluate hip flexion amplitude. The evaluations were performed with volunteers in supine position by three raters. For evaluation of pelvic retroversion, the mean ± SD (minimum-maximum) was calculated. Reliability of the accelerometer between raters was determined by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). The linear correlation coefficient between hip flexion was determined by using goniometer and accelerometer. The mean pelvic retroversion was 7.3° ± 0.93° (6°-11°) in the clinical limit of the hip range of motion, which was 106.25° ± 10.46° (93°-130°). The ICC between two raters were 0.60, 0.71 and 0.74 (goniometer) and 0.46, 0.71 and 0.83 (accelerometer). The linear correlation between hip flexion measurements with goniometer and accelerometer was 0.87. During clinical evaluation of the final range of hip flexion, there was an associated pelvic movement of approximately 7.3º. Accelerometers have proven to be reliable for measurement of hip flexion. <i>Level of Evidence III, Study of nonconsecutive patients with no gold reference standard applied uniformly.</i>
