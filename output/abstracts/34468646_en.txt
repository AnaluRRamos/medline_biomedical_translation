This study analyzed the delay in the primary surgical treatment of patients with cleft lip and palate in Brazil performed under the Unified Health System (SUS), and the effect of the sociodemographic context and municipal socioeconomic indicators on access to this treatment (2009-2013). Data from the Decentralized Hospital Information System relating to all hospital authorization forms paid for primary cleft lip and/or palate surgeries and socioeconomic data (2010) was used. The ages recommended by the American Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Association (12 months for lip surgeries and 18 months for palate surgeries) were used as parameters. The prevalence of delay observed in primary lip surgeries was 66.4% and in palate surgeries was 71.2%. The North and Northeast regions had the worst percentages of delay. Non-whites had a greater prevalence of delay in cleft lip surgeries with PR = 1.40 (1.30-1.50) and cleft palate surgeries with PR = 1.27 (1.21-1.33). The multilevel analysis identified the influence of self-reported skin color and Human Development Index (HDI) on the delay of primary lip surgery, and of HDI on the delay of palate surgery. The importance of social determination on the access to primary cleft lip and palate surgeries was evident.
