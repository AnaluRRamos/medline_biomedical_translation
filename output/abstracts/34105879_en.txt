To develop a nursing outcome, consistent with the standardized format of outcomes within the nursing Outcomes Classification (NOC). This outcome will include an outcome label, an outcome definition, and clinical indicators. The proposed use for this outcome is to evaluate the access site of a percutaneous procedure. Concept analysis with a scoping review. Initially, content experts were recruited to validate the indicators of the proposed outcome in order to complete a consensus validation. After consensus validation, a review of the proposed outcome and its indicators was completed by two of the editors of the NOC team to confirm that the outcome label, definition, and indicators were consistent with the NOC taxonomy. During this review, edits were made on the label name and definition. After a series of reviews, the initial outcome of Vascular Status: Percutaneous Procedure Access was changed to Tissue Injury Severity: Percutaneous Procedure. In addition, the original definition of the condition of an access site for percutaneous procedure by venous or arterial puncture and health of surrounding tissues was edited to: Severity of complications from a needle-puncture access through the skin and into deeper tissues. The outcome has 11 indicators to be used to formulate a target rating for use in the clinical setting. The indicators were not edited over the course of the reviews. The proposed outcome will assist nurses in evaluating the access site of percutaneous procedures and in identifying possible complications. This research contributes to the refinement of the NOC taxonomy by having a new outcome that meets clinical practice needs.
