To evaluate the tomographic distance between the sternoclavicular joints and the nearest hilar structures. Computed tomography images (axial and sagittal slices) in 120 healthy individuals (60 men and 60 women) between 18 and 60 years old were prospectively analyzed. The distances from both sternoclavicular joints to the respective brachiocephalic veins, trachea, esophagus, and lung apexes were measured and related to age, sex, and body mass index. Statistically significant differences were found in the distance from the right and left sternoclavicular joint distances and the corresponding brachiocephalic vein, esophagus, and lung apexes. In women, both sides were closer to the noble structures. In patients with body mass index <25, the distances were significantly less than in heavier patients. The left sternoclavicular joint is closer to the hilar structures than the contralateral side. In women, both sternoclavicular joints are closer to the brachiocephalic veins, esophagus, and lung apexes than in men. Patients with body mass index <25 have shorter distances between these joints and the brachiocephalic veins and esophagus. <i><b>Level of Evidence II; Prognostic studies - Investigating the effect of a patient characteristic on the outcome of disease.</b></i>
