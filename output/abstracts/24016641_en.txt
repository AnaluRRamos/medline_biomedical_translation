To evaluate the correlation between scores on the MAST and AUDIT in patients hospitalized for detoxification from alcohol dependence and consider if the intensity of those scores reflect the severity of dependence and problems related to alcohol use. Correlational study. Patients admitted for the first time for alcohol dependence treatment. In addition to a structured interview, the MAST and the AUDIT, SADD was used to assess the degree of alcohol dependence and the APQ to assess the problems related to alcohol consumption. The internal consistency (Cronbach's Î±) of the MAST was 0.77 and the AUDIT was 0.73. The correlation between the two instruments was moderate (R = 0.497, p < 0.001). Both presented moderate and significant correlation (p < 0.001) with the APQ and SADD. The set of items from AUDIT directed towards dependence led to a higher correlation with SADD than with APQ, the reverse being true with the set of items belonging to the dimension problems / adverse consequences. The two instruments have low correlation with the volume of alcohol consumption measured in g/d. Both the MAST and the AUDIT have a total score that reflects the severity of dependence and alcohol-induced disorders. In clinical populations, these instruments can be used as a continuous variable to record quantitatively the magnitude of the problems. The AUDIT, relatively to the MAST, has the advantage of representing a smaller number of items, making it easier to answer and quote. The AUDIT also has the advantage of presenting sets of items belonging to three dimensions (quantity / frequency, dependency, problems / adverse effects) that can be analyzed separately, allowing for the characterization and further specification of the situations under study.
