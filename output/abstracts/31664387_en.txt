This study aimed to estimate the strength of association among smokers with variables regarding mental health, family functionality, and use of other psychoactive substances. This is a case-control observational study developed from March to November 2016. The study was conducted in a Brazilian Midwest municipality with 646 subjects, of which 323 were cases. In the model, the case group comprised subjects with a certain degree of tobacco dependence. The control group included subjects that were not exposed to tobacco. Concerning tobacco use time, the mean exposure of the case group was 25.65 years. In the multiple logistic regression analysis model the following were positively associated: non-white skin color (p = 0.002); years of study ≤ 8 (p < 0.001); having children (p < 0.001); informal work (p = 0.024); not having a health plan (p < 0.001); high family dysfunction (p = 0.007); AUDIT ≥ 8 (p < 0.001); depression (p < 0.001); having illicit drug in lifetime (p < 0.001); living with other people (p = 0.003) and no religion (p = 0.001). This study reinforces the vulnerability of smokers, associating variables correlated to the field of mental health, and innovates by discussing the influence of family relationships on nicotinic dependence.
