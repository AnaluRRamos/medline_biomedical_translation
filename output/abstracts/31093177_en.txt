This article summarizes the current challenges of family medicine in Latin America and proposes possible lines of action to consolidate its development. In the last 40 years, the health systems of the Region of the Americas have faced reforms whose results were negative in terms of equity, and primary health care, far from being a strategy designed to reduce it, was restricted to a selective and focal policy. In this context, the technical proposals for expansion of training positions in family medicine and their insertion in medical careers have lacked consistency and a clear political direction, and thus their lack of effectiveness can be considered a symptom of these incomplete reforms. In this regard, the Ibero-American Confederation of Family Medicine made recommendations on the political commitment of governments to ensure the necessary structure and funding, consolidate the model of family medicine as a mechanism for the implementation of primary health care, the hierarchy of programs of training, the working conditions of family doctors and professional certification, among others. These technical recommendations, without a consistent and timely political action, will not be more successful than previous attempts.
