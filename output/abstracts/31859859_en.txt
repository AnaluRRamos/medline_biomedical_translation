The present article analyzes the job market of nursing professionals, based on data obtained through the survey 'Nursing Profile in Brazil' (Cofen - Fiocruz), showing that a significant portion of these workers, mostly nursing aides and technicians, live in increasingly precarious conditions of survival, with low wages, multi-employment and insecurity in the work environment, which prevents them from performing their work activities with dignity. It also analyzes the Nursing regulation process, having as reference the sociology of professions, from the creation of the Federal Nursing Council/Regional Nursing Councils System, in the 1970s, when the category started to have self-regulation autonomy, and currently, the profession shows a robust and highly regulatory legal milestone, considering the number of resolutions issued by Cofen, which have an impact on professional practice. The article points out that it is essential for the government to develop and improve job management and regulation policies, in order to contribute to overcome the problems faced by nursing professionals.
