to evaluate the data obtained from patients with transtrochanteric fractures who were attended at a tertiary-level trauma referral hospital, between admission and discharge, gathered prospectively by means of the SINPE(©) software. 109 consecutive patients who were admitted between April 2011 and January 2012 were evaluated using an electronic storage and analysis database in SINPE(©). The data were gathered prospectively, including evaluations on personal information about the patients, history-taking, fracture classification (Evans-Jensen, AO/OTA and Tronzo), treatment and discharge. the sample was composed of 43 men and 66 women. Their ages ranged from 20 to 105 years, with a mean of 69 years. Falling was the trauma mechanism for 92 patients and traffic accidents for 17. The most prevalent chronic diseases were systemic arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus. According to the AO/OTA classification, the commonest fracture type was 31 A1. According to the Tronzo classification, type III was commonest. The fracture was fixed by means of a cephalomedullary nail in 64 cases and a sliding screw-plate in 44 cases. One fracture was fixed with a 95° screw-plate. Seven patients presented some form of clinical complication and three died during the hospital stay. All the patients who were discharged were instructed to only partially bear weight on the repair. through SINPE(©), it was possible to evaluate the personal information, history-taking, classification, treatment and discharge of patients with transtrochanteric fractures, from hospital admission to discharge.
