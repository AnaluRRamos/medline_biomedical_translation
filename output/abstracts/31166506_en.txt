Given the financial impact of the adoption of new health technologies in health systems, choosing what technology should be introduced and when poses a major challenge for health managers. The health technology assessment (HTA) process should therefore be underpinned by transparent and objective criteria. The objective of this study was to analyze HTA processes in Brazil, overseen by the National Commission for the Incorporation of Health Technology (CONITEC), and to compare these processes with those in countries considered to be at the forefront of this field: Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The following categories were used for the comparative analysis: program structure, definition and selection of topics, evidence review, use of HTA in decision making, program products and dissemination, and transparency. The findings show that there are more similarities than differences between these countries' processes and the CONITEC processes. The main differences identified were: composition of committees, entitlement to appeal, program evaluation, and timeframes for the implementation of recommendations/decisions. Despite making major strides in recent years, Brazil should continue to promote continuous improvement of its HTA process.
