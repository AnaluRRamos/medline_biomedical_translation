The scope of this research was to characterize and quantify the perforating waste produced domestically by people with diabetes mellitus (DM), as well as to analyze the discard and disposal practices for these materials. The data collection was performed through a questionnaire applied to primary care patients. The sample consisted of 149 people, the majority of whom were elderly and with a low level of schooling. Regarding the generation of waste, 88.64% of the deponents declared the use of one syringe per day, performing 1 to 4 applications. The reuse of the material was reported by 66.67% of the declarants. After being used, the waste was stored - with higher prevalence - in plastic bags (20.8%), plastic bottles, clothes softener and mayonnaise containers, etc. (46.98%). Ordinary household waste was the main disposal site for the perforating waste. Furthermore, it was revealed that those people who did not receive instructions regarding appropriate waste disposal discarded their waste incorrectly. Based on the results, the conclusion drawn is that the diabetics who participated in this study fail to discard and dispose of the perforating waste appropriately due to the lack of adequate guidelines and public programs.
