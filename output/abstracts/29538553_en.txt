The scope of this study was to characterize malocclusion in 12-year-old Brazilian children and identify associated socio-demographic aspects. It is a cross-sectional and analytical study based on an Oral Health Survey (SB Brasil 2010). A sample of 5,539 was included, among which 41% had some degree of malocclusion according to the Dental Aesthetic Index (DAI). Descriptive, bivariate and multiple multinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted. Defined malocclusion was greater among those who rated their oral health as neither satisfied/nor dissatisfied (OR 1.24; CI95%1.03-1.50) and dissatisfied (OR 1.76; CI95%1.50-2.08). Severe malocclusion was greater among children in the Southeast (OR 1.44; CI95%1.06-1.96) and South (OR 1.52; CI95%1.05-2.19), male (OR 1.24; CI95%1.03-1.48), black/brown (OR 1.39; CI95%1.14-1.69) who rated their oral health as neither satisfied/nor dissatisfied (OR 1.79; CI95%1.41-2.26) and dissatisfied (OR 2.20; CI95%1.77-2.72). Very severe malocclusion was higher among residents of capitals (OR 1.36; CI95%1.07-1.71) who evaluated their oral health as neither satisfied/nor dissatisfied (OR 1.58; CI95%1.22-2.05) and dissatisfied (OR 2.44; CI95%1.96-3.03). The prevalence of malocclusion is high among Brazilian children, the severity being associated with socio-demographic aspects.
