The developing brain in utero and during the first years of life is highly vulnerable to environmental influences. Experiences occurring during this period permanently modify brain structure and function through epigenetic modifications (alterations of the DNA structure and chromatin function) and consequently affect the susceptibility to mental disorders. In this review, we describe evidence linking adverse environmental variation during early life (from the fetal period to childhood) and long-term changes in brain volume, microstructure, and connectivity, especially in amygdala and hippocampal regions. We also describe genetic variations that moderate the impact of adverse environmental conditions on child neurodevelopment, such as polymorphisms in brain-derived neurotrophic factor and catechol-O-methyltransferase genes, as well as genetic pathways related to glutamate and monoaminergic signaling. Lastly, we have depicted positive early life experiences that could benefit childhood neurodevelopment and reverse some detrimental effects of adversity in the offspring. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Prenatal, peripartum, and postnatal adversities influence child behavior and neurodevelopment. Exposure to environmental enrichment and positive influences may revert these effects. Putative mechanisms involve alterations in neurotrophic factors and neurotransmitter systems. New tools/big data improved the understanding on how early adversity alters neurodevelopment. This permits better translation/application of the findings from animal models to humans.
