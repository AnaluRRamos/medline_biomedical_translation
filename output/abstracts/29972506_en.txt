This article is an objective examination of aspects of gender and sexual rights, and their implications in the field of health field, using the methodology of an essay. The first part discusses femicide, highlighting that there are deaths of women due to the fact of being women, which constitute what could be described as the crimes of lèse-humanité or 'femi-genocide'. The second part discusses sexual and gender diversity, with an emphasis on the fragility of the 'right to have rights' expressed in the deterioration in health conditions of the population that is LGBTI (Lesbians, Gays, Bisexuals, Transvestites, Transsexuals and Intersex). Finally, the essay discusses recognition of gender plurality, and the limitations imposed on the rights of non-usual normativebodies bodies; criticism is directed at reiteration of the binary and cisgender normative ethos, which can exacerbate the health vulnerability of people with trans and other non-normative bodies and identities. It is concluded that, in the 30 years' existence of Brazil's Unified Health System (SUS), there have been advances in the political sphere, many of them created by or as a result of social movements, and initiatives that seek to confront femicide and the inadequate assistance available to LGBTI people. In the context of these challenges, it is reiterated that there is a necessary relationship between promotion of health and protection of human rights related to gender and sexuality.
