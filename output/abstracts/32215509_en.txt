This study aims to analyze survival rates in acute lymphocytic leukemia in the city of S達o Paulo, Brazil, from 1997 to 2013, according to sex, age bracket, and administrative region. This was a longitudinal study to calculate survival rates. Data on new cases of leukemia in the age bracket 0 to 14 years of age were collected from the database in the Population-Based Cancer Registry of the city of S達o Paulo. Population and mortality data were obtained from the Brazilian Health Informatics Department. The sample included children 0 to 14 years of age diagnosed with leukemia from 1997 to 2013, living in the city of S達o Paulo. The variables were sex, age bracket, and Regional Health Divisions. The survival analysis calculated the Kaplan-Meier product limit estimator and compared the survival curves through the log-rank test, and the Cox proportional risks model was adjusted. The estimated majority of new cases were males, 0 to 4 years of age, diagnosed from 2000 to 2004, and living in the southeast regional division of the city of S達o Paulo. The estimated overall incidence rate was 34.7 new cases per million, and the mortality rate was 9.0 deaths per million. The overall five-year survival of children from acute lymphocytic leukemia was 68%. There was a statistically significant difference according to decade of diagnosis (p = 0.026), and specifically the survival rates decreased over the years, with the worst prognosis in the years 2005-2009.
