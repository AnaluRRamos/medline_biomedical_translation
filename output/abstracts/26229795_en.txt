to determine whether 3D reconstruction images from computed tomography (CT) increase the inter and intraobserver agreement of the Neer and Arbeitsgemeinschaft f√ºr Osteosynthesefragen (AO) classification systems. radiographic images and tomographic images with 3D reconstruction were obtained in three shoulder positions and were analyzed on two occasions by four independent observers. the radiographic evaluation demonstrated that using CT improved the inter and intraobserver agreement of the Neer classification. This was not seen with the AO classification, in which CT was only shown to increase the interobserver agreement. use of 3D CT allows better evaluation of fractures with regard to their component parts and their displacements, but nevertheless the intraobserver agreement presented is less than ideal.
