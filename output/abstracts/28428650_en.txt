The aim of this study was to evaluate breast arterial calcification (BAC) detected on routine mammography, analyzing its association with chronic degenerative disease. This was a cross-sectional study involving women treated at a specialized outpatient clinic for high-risk hypertension, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease, as well as volunteers who participated in a study to validate a method of screening for occult renal disease. A total of 312 patients between 40 and 69 years of age, with no history of breast cancer, all of whom had undergone routine mammography in the last two years, were included. The mammograms were analyzed by researchers who were unaware of the risk factors for BAC in each case. The mean age was 55.9 ± 7.4 years, and 64.3% of the patients were white. The mean glomerular filtration rate was 41.87 ± 6.23 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. Seventy-one patients (22.8%) had BAC. We found that BAC was associated with advanced age, hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and low glomerular filtration rate. In the multivariate analysis, advanced age and diabetes continued to be associated with BAC. The odds ratio for BAC was higher for all chronic diseases. The association of BAC with advanced age, hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and low glomerular filtration rate should call the attention of radiologists. Therefore, the presence of BAC should be reported, and patients with BAC should be screened for those diseases.
