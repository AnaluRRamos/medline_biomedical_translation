This paper aims to discuss Brazilian undergraduate students'learning in the public health. This is a descriptive, reflexive study, characterized as an experience report. Theoretical references of the Canadian and Brazilian health systems were used in order to analyze the public health and the impact of international educational exchange in professional qualification. There are theoretical and conceptual similarities in health systems, in the understanding of social determinants. However, the application of the social determinants of health yielded more results in the Canadian system. Public health learning in a Canadian university highlighted a great focus on determinants, allowing the students to think about Brazilian health care models. With this experience, discussions can be held in educational spaces, reflecting the social implication of Science without Borders Program in professional education.
