In this paper, we describe a case series of four patients who were admitted with emergencies related to aortic aneurysms over a 3-day period and were treated with endovascular repair. The first patient was an 81-year-old female with a history of abdominal pain and a ruptured aortic aneurysm diagnosed by AngioCT-scan. The second patient was a 63-year-old male with a history of oral digestive bleeding and an AngioCT-scan showing an aortoenteric fistula. The third patient was a 77-year-old female with sudden-onset abdominal pain and ruptured right common iliac aneurysm. The fourth patient presented with abdominal pain and an AngioCT-scan showed aortic rupture. All four patients were discharged with no major complications or surgical mortality. These case series show that despite the Covid-19 pandemic situation, since elective surgeries decreased, vascular emergencies have increased.
