A prevalence study was conducted to compare quality of life and food insecurity in men and women living with HIV/AIDS. The sample comprised 481 HIV-infected individuals undergoing antiretroviral therapy at a referral hospital in the State of Para√≠ba, Brazil. Food insecurity and quality of life were assessed using the Brazilian Household Food Insecurity Scale and WHOQOL-HIV Bref, respectively. The results were presented as absolute and relative frequencies and gender differences were tested using the chi-squared test adopting a significance level of 0.05. The findings showed that 40.1% of the sample were women. A higher percentage of women than men had a low income and low education level (65.8% and 72.5%, respectively). Prevalence of food security was lower in women than in men (29.0% compared to 42.7%), and a higher percentage of women than men reported below average quality of life (54.9% compared to 44.4%). The findings reveal that, besides the usual difficulties faced by HIV-infected patients, this group showed a significant level of gender inequality. The management of HIV patient care should consider these important findings, promoting access to care and support services and gender equality so that women can live fairer and more equal lives.
