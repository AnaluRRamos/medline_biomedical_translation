Descriptive epidemiological studies are of relevance, given that there are inconsistencies in the literature with regard to their nomenclature and classification. We reviewed 19 international and six national academic textbooks on epidemiology, where the main criterion was to have them available in order to undertake an in-depth review of chapters on descriptive epidemiology and study types. In 11 books, the authors prioritize analytical studies. Twelve foreign texts and two from Brazil include descriptive studies, although the majority did not specifically refer to a category with this name. We propose a classification based on the answers to research questions, including the following types of study: case report, case series, clinical cohort, prevalence study, incidence study (cohort) and descriptive ecological study. We discuss potential uses, implementation of novel data analysis methods and their relevance in health surveillance.
