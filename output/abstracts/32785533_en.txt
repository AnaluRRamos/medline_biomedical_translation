The scope of this research was to identify and characterize spatial units of epidemiological relevance in the state of Rio de Janeiro, through the highest concentrations of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) from 1980 to 2012, considering the geographical aspects. SUCAM, FUNASA and SINAN databases were consulted. A method of adjustment of spatially referenced data for demarcation of the regions with the highest concentrations of cases called circuits and poles was applied. These were superimposed on the socioenvironmental indicator maps. Of the total cases registered in the period, 87% occurred in the municipalities located in the resulting circuits and poles. The variations in the occurrence of cases in the different circuits and poles were not related to the socioenvironmental indicators. The identification of the circuits and poles can subsidize the state CL program of the prioritization of strategies of prevention and control actions and the optimization of the resources of the program. These regions, which are more stable than the localities, allow surveillance and control operations in locations with many cases and in other locations in the identified risk area, because they have the same characteristics as those already affected.
