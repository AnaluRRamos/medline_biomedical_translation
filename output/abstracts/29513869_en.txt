The purpose of this study was to apply the Test of Pragmatic Skills in Brazilian children with normal development. Participants of this study were 60 children 3:00 to 8:11 years old, equally divided between genders. The examiners had prior contact with the group of children and applied the TOPS - a traditional test that proposes four sets of simple activities, with the common material, applicable in a short period of time - according to the procedure proposed by the author. The results showed a large variability in performance, illustrating that the linguistic and pragmatic skills develop according to the age. It was also observed that the subjects performed all the categories of communicative intentions required by Shulman, indicating that it is not the presence or absence of a specific intent that influences the score in this test, but the quality of the answers provided, which evolves with age. Thus, we can conclude that the TOPS proved to be an important instrument that allows answers in informal conversation contexts, verifying that the test is effective in assessing the pragmatic skills of typically developing children and can be an important tool to be used in the assessment of communicative intentions in Brazilian children.
