The prognostic significance of <i>delirium</i> in hospitalized elderly has not yet been fully clarified. The present study was designed to evaluate the relationship between prevalent <i>delirium</i> (PrD), incident <i>delirium</i> (InD) and final outcome. A historical cohort of 261 patients was selected. <i>delirium</i> was diagnosed using the Confusion Assessment Method. The total frequency of delirium detected was 42.5%-31.4% PrD and 16.2% InD. Among patients with InD, the average length of hospital stay was 9.1 days longer than for patients without <i>delirium</i> (p=0.002), and the hospital mortality associated with InD was 48% versus 2.7% for those without <i>delirium</i> (p< 0.001). However, no difference was observed between patients with PrD and those without delirium. These results suggest that, when investigating <i>delirium</i> and prognosis amongst hospitalized elderly, it is fundamental to differentiate in terms of time of onset. Furthermore, the absence of delirium seems to be an important protective factor.
