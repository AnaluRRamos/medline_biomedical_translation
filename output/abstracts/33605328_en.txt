Nursing information systems, where quality indicators are integrated, focus on the standardization of health records and the consequent visibility of the provided care. Despite the acknowledged importance of the contributions of information systems, their implementation has been characterized by several challenges, so we propose to reflect on them. To identify the evidence available in the literature on these same challenges, a narrative review of the literature was developed, with the analysis of relevant articles and reports on this issue. It is clear in the literature the importance of information systems for obtaining quality indicators that are sensitive to nursing care, with a positive impact on the quality of care, allowing for measurable quality in interventions, as well as facilitating inter and intra-institutional comparability, in real-time or in a retrospective analysis. The challenges encountered and which urgently needs to be resolved in clinical practice are related to the difficulty for professionals to perceive the impact of computer records, the visibility of nursing indicators and the time that is allocated in the context of providing care to carry out these records.
