The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of the introduction of the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10) on the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and on community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in hospitalized children under 5 years of age in the southern area of Santiago, Chile. An ecological study was conducted on the incidence of IPD and CAP in children under age 5 in the southern area of Santiago (Chile) from 2009 to 2015. The information used was from bacteriology laboratories in four hospitals, the Chilean Institute of Health Public (ISP), and hospital discharge records. A total of 6,461 cases of CAP and 173 cases of IPD were confirmed by the ISP; 169 of these cases were diagnosed in the bacteriology laboratories of the hospitals included in the study. When the incidence of cases in 2010 was compared to 2011-2015, the incidence ratio (IR) of IPD declined 10% annually (p=0.026) and CAP declined by 8% in the same period (p<0.001). Days of hospitalization due to IPD were reduced by 39% (p<0.001). Between 2009 and 2012, seven children died, but since then there have been no deaths due to these diseases. The introduction of the PCV-10 vaccine into the National Immunization Program has had a positive effect, with a significant reduction in IPD and CAP and in days of hospitalization due to IPD, while preventing cases and deaths.
