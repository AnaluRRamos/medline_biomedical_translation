to assess the efficacy of weight loss, the evolution of comorbidities, the quality of life and the BAROS protocol (Bariatric Analysis and Reporting Outcome System) in the postoperative period of patients undergoing bariatric surgery. we conducted a cross-sectional, quantitative study with 95% true strength (P=0.05), with 103 patients submitted to SLEEVE Vertical Gastrectomy (40) and Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (63), from four months after surgery. We carried out the research at the Ambulatory of General Surgery of the Clinics Hospital of the Federal University of Pernambuco, using the BAROS protocol. the majority of the patients were female (89.3%). The mean age was 44.23 years. The mean percentage loss of excess weight was 69.35%. The mean postoperative follow-up time was 41.87 months (Â±37.35). The comorbidities with the highest percentage of resolution were sleep apnea (90.2%), diabetes (80.7%) and hypertension (70.8%). The most frequent complications were hair loss (79.6%), nutritional deficiency (37.9%) and anemia (35%). The BAROS protocol demonstrated that patients positively evaluated quality of life in 93.2% of the cases. The Moorehead-Ardelt questionnaire showed that quality of life 'improved' or 'improved greatly' for 94.1% of patients. bariatric surgery has been shown to be an effective procedure in the treatment of morbid obesity and in the control of comorbidities. Quality of life analysis was evaluated positively through the BAROS protocol.
