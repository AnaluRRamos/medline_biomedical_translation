The practice of homeopathy developed significantly in Brazil at the turn of the twentieth century. Especially in Rio Grande do Sul, the southernmost state in Brazil, homeopaths were able to introduce their practices by linking them to a scientific perspective that organized a plan for advanced training as well as to a religious movement which disseminated the use of homeopathy through prescriptions received by mediums. These two movements had supporters who worked on several fronts, offering homeopathic medicines for free or spreading their ideas in magazines and other vehicles. The article analyzes these contexts in which homeopaths and Spiritist practices interacted during the first half of the twentieth century in an attempt to understand how these perspectives approached each other and permitted continuity.
