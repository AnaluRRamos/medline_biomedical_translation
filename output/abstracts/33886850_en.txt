To present guidelines on sensory motor stimulation for newborns and infants in the intensive care unit. We employed a mixed methods design with a systematic review of the literature and recommendations based on scientific evidence and the opinions of physiotherapists with neonatal expertise. The research included studies published between 2010 and 2018 in the MEDLINEÂ® and Cochrane databases that included newborns (preterm and term) and infants (between 28 days and 6 months of age) hospitalized in the intensive care unit and submitted to sensory motor stimulation methods. The studies found were classified according to the GRADE score by five physiotherapists in different regions of Brazil and presented at eight Scientific Congresses held to discuss the clinical practice guidelines. We included 89 articles to construct the clinical practice guidelines. Auditory, gustatory and skin-to-skin stimulation stand out for enhancing vital signs, and tactile-kinesthetic massage and multisensory stimulation stand out for improving weight or sucking. Although all modalities have good ratings for pain or stress control, it is recommended that sensory motor stimulation procedures be tailored to the infant's specific needs and that interventions and be carried out by expert professionals.
