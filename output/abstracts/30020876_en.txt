Systemic sclerosis is a complex disorder that requires systematic screening. Our objective is to report the European Scleroderma Trials and Research group centre affiliation and its impact in our clinical practice. The European Scleroderma Trials and Research group affiliation process, database update and current patient evaluation, with respect to demographic and clinical features. Cumulative mortality was analysed. We identified 19 female patients (which met all the American College of Rheumatology/ European League Against Rheumatism 2013 criteria for systemic sclerosis) under current follow-up, divided according to the LeRoy classification into diffuse cutaneous (n = 5), limited cutaneous (n = 11) and limited (n = 3) types, followed for a median period of 5, 12 and 6 years, respectively. Raynaud´s phenomenon and abnormal nailfold capillaries were universally present. Interstitial lung disease was absent in the limited cutaneous form but present in 100% of the diffuse subtype. Pitting scars were more common in the diffuse form. Active disease was also more frequent in the diffuse form, and most patients with active disease were treated with anti-endothelin receptor antagonists. Over 21 years (from 1994 to 2015) the mortality rate was 55% (n = 23/42). Age at time of death was significantly lower in the diffuse subtype. Our single centre cohort shares many features with larger and international reports and more specifically is in accordance with patient characteristics described in the European Scleroderma Trials and Research group registries. The European Scleroderma Trials and Research group registration motivated our systematic patient characterization and may be used as a tool for homogenous disease registries.
