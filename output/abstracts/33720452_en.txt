Dogs with cutaneous diseases often receive supplementation with omega-3 (n-3) and omega-6 (n-6) essential fatty acids (FA), either through their diet or the use of an oral supplement. Labelling on these products is not always clear, especially regarding the total and relative amounts of FA. To provide clinicians with a breakdown of the FA content of selected veterinary diets, supplements and fish oil capsules so that the daily dose of supplementation can be calculated more easily. Repeated measurements of FA content over time demonstrate whether FA content changes temporally. Eight veterinary diets, four veterinary oral FA supplements and four fish oil supplements were analysed for FA content by gas chromatography at days 0, 28 and 56. The n-6:n-3 ratio varied among the supplement types with the food samples having higher ratios than the liquid supplements and fish oil capsules. The composition of n-3 FA differed between products with some having higher concentrations of the less active n-3 FA alpha-linolenic acid than eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. No decreases in FA content over time were detected. The results of this study provide the reader with a means to calculate the FA concentrations that their patient is receiving for each product tested, as well as allowing them to compare products for their differences in n-6:n-3 ratios and relative amounts of individual FA molecules. The FA concentrations did not change significantly over 56Â days.
