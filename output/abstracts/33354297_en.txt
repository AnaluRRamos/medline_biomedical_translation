Major neurocognitive disorder due to multiple etiologies, or dementia due to multiple etiologies (DME), is a term coined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders to refer to complex cases when multiple pathologies, such as Alzheimer's disease, Lewy Bodies, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), vascular-related brain damage or frontotemporal lobar degeneration, are identified as contributing to neurocognitive impairment and/or behavioral alterations, based on patient's neuroimaging tests, laboratorial exams, associated symptomatology and medical history. In this study, we report the case of a 63-year-old male patient who presented with parkinsonism symptoms, aphasia and cognitive impairment on multiple domains after cerebral toxoplasmosis related to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, vascular damage and a history of alcohol abuse. We discuss the neurocognitive and neurobehavioral variables that characterized this diagnosis, as well as the importance of the differential diagnosis of DME on the field of neuropsychology of aging and, especially, for individuals living with HIV infection.
