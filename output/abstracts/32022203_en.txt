The objective of this study was to analyze the space-time distribution of mortality by suicide in the State of Rio Grande do Norte (RN) between 2000 and 2015. This is a mixed ecological study that evaluated the deaths due to suicide registered in RN. Spatial analysis was performed using crude and standardized rates. Univariate analysis was conducted using the Moran Global and Local Index, and spatial bivariate analysis was assessed using the cross-referencing of sociodemographic variables and mortality rates. By applying Joinpoint Regression, it was possible to verify the suicide mortality trend. There were 2,266 suicide deaths from 2000 to 2015, and spatial analysis showed poor spatial autocorrelation (I <0.3) for the Standardized Mortality Rates for both sexes, with formation of spatial clusters in the Seridó Region. The bivariate analysis showed the formation of clusters in the Seridó Region with HDI and Aging variables. In addition, there was a trend of increased male mortality up to 2003 (APC = 15.3%, CI = 9.2-21.8), followed by a period of stability.
