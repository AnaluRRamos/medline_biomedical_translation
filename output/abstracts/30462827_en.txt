to compare clinical, laboratory and densitometric data from patients with osteoarthrosis and femoral neck fractures. we conducted a cross-sectional study of patients with femoral neck fracture and hip osteoarthrosis submitted to hip arthroplasty. We collected clinical, laboratory and densitometric data. we included 53 patients, 22 with femoral neck fractures and 31 with osteoarthrosis. Patients with femoral neck fractures were older than patients with osteoarthrosis, with lower BMI values, bone mineral density and palmar grip strength (sarcopenic patients), being more neurologically impaired and presenting a worse ASA score. Among the various biochemical parameters analyzed, we found statistically significant differences in total serum calcium, ionized calcium, vitamin D, free thyroxine, erythrocytes, hemoglobin, hematocrit, total white blood cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes and creatinine between the two groups. Other hormones analyzed and biochemical parameters did not differ significantly, although they showed trends between the two groups. patients with femoral neck fractures are older than patients with osteoarthrosis, have a lower weight and BMI, are more debilitated, many with anemia and reduced bone mass, and have a significant decrease in total calcium, ionized calcium, vitamin D and creatinine and a significant increase in free thyroxine.
