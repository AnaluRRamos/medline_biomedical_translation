Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is an important cardiovascular risk factor, regardless of arterial hypertension. Despite the evolution of imaging tests, the electrocardiogram (ECG) is still the most used in the initial evaluation, however, with low sensitivity. To evaluate the performance of the main electrocardiographic criteria for LVH in elderly and very elderly hypertensive individuals. In a cohort of hypertensive patients, ECGs and doppler echocardiographies (ECHO) were performed and separated into three age groups: <60 years, Group I; 60-79 years Group II; and ≥80 years, Group III. The most used electrocardiographic criteria were applied for the diagnosis of LVH: Perugia; Pegaro-Lo Presti; Gubner-Ungerleider; Narita; (Rm+Sm) x duration; Cornell voltage; Cornell voltage duration; Sokolow-Lyon voltage; R of aVL ≥11 mm; RaVL duration. In evaluating the performance of these criteria, in addition to sensitivity (Sen) and specificity (Esp), the “Diagnostic Odds Ratios” (DOR) were analyzed. We considered p-value <0.05 for the analyses, with two-tailed tests. In 2,458 patients, LVH was present by ECHO in 781 (31.7%). In Groups I and II, the best performances were for the criteria of Narita, Perugia, (Rm+Sm) x duration, with no statistical differences between them. In Group III (very elderly) the Perugia criteria and (Rm+Sm) x duration had the best performances: Perugia [44,7/89.3; (Sen/Esp)] and (Rm+Sm) duration [39.4%/91.3%; (Sen/Esp), p<0.05)], with the best PAIN results:6.8. This suggests that in this very elderly population, these criteria have greater discriminatory power to separate patients with LVH. In very elderly hypertensive patients, the Perugia electrocardiographic criteria and (Rm+Sm) x duration showed the best diagnostic performance for LVH.
