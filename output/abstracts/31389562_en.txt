The scope of this study is to analyze the prevalence and factors associated with Chronic Noncommunicable Diseases (CNCD) in adults living in an impoverished urban area located in Recife in the Brazilian northeast. It is a cross-sectional study with a sample of 631 adults of 20 to 59 years of age. The possible associations of CNCD with demographic, socioeconomic, behavioral and health-related factors were analyzed using Poisson Regression, considering a p value of < 0.05 as being statistically significant. The prevalence of CNCD was 56.7%; highest among males (60.8%); adults aged 50-59 years (80.5%); lower economic class (57.7%); and lower level of schooling (62%). The problem was also associated with individuals with BMI â‰¥ 25 kg/m2 (34.2%) as well as individuals who reported poor health status (76.4%). In the multivariate hierarchical model, the statistically significant variables were: schooling, BMI, health perception, gender and age bracket. A high prevalence of at least one CNCD was observed, as well as a statistically significant association between CNCD and the following variables: schooling, BMI, health perception, gender and age bracket. These results suggest the need to intensify health promotion actions in poor communities, aiming at enhanced control of health in general.
