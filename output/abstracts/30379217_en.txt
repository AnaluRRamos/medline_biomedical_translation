The acquisition of psychomotor skills in surgery is the central component of medical residency programs in General Surgery and Specialties. Making learning more effective is a cornerstone of educational processes. This article portrays aspects of educational taxonomies and learning theories that may be involved in the training of surgery. Among the many taxonomies and educational theories applicable to learning in surgery, the following stand out: 1) Dave's taxonomy- Hierarchy to actions that facilitate the acquisition of psychomotor skills; 2) Miller's theory- Step-by-step definition that facilitates acquisition; 3) Ericsson's theory- Competence after repetition of the practice followed by systematic reinforcement; 4) Vigotsky's theory- Definition of the role of the specialist in learning; and 5) Theory of Boud, Schon and Ende- Importance of feedback for students and teachers. Knowledge of these tools by teachers and preceptors can facilitate learning in surgery, especially in more complex activities.
