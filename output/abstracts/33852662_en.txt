The study presents an assessment of the health and social impacts from the implementation of water supply systems in riverine communities in the Middle Solim√µes region, Amazonas State, Brazil. Data were collected in 21 rural communities, 19 of which received the water access technology experimentally in the last 14 years. For comparison, three rural communities that had not received the technology participated in the study. A quantitative/qualitative methodology was used with the following techniques: focus groups, semi-structured interviews, questionnaires, parasitological tests, and water quality analysis. Even without a reduction in the prevalence of parasite infections, the systems showed impacts on comfort, privacy, and reduction in the time spent on household chores such as fetching water or having to wash clothes and pots and pans outdoors and far from home. The impacts point to an improvement in living conditions from the perspective of wellbeing.
