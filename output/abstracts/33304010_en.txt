Such variations are easily overlooked on conventional radiography and computed tomography if they are not actively investigated, mainly because most indications for a chest X-ray studies aim to evaluate the lung parenchyma and mediastinal structures. The objective of this pictorial essay was to use multislice computed tomography images to illustrate the imaging aspects of the main anatomical variations and congenital anomalies of the ribs.
