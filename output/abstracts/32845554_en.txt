Dermatophytosis is a common problem in cattle. The aetiological factors associated with this disease are filamentous fungi with the ability to digest and grow on keratinized substrates. In cattle, and less frequently in other domestic animals and people, the dermatophyte Trichophyton verrucosum is most commonly isolated from skin lesions. The dermatophyte Trichophyton benhamiae is an important zoonotic pathogen, and the main sources of transmission are guinea pigs and other small rodents. In this report, we show multispecies infection in calves (Bos taurus) after long-term transport and vaccination against trichophytosis. Sixty animals were imported of which 32 were observed to be affected with superficial infection nine to 12 days after vaccination for dermatophytosis. Diagnosis was made correlating the clinical signs with a micro- and macroscopic examination of cultured fungi. Molecular differentiation was used to confirm the species affiliation. Eight of the calves were infected with T. verrucosum alone, and 24 calves with both T. verrucosum and T. benhamiae. We suggest that the cause of this large outbreak was immunosuppression of the animals resulting from the stress of transport and administration of vaccine. Both T. verrucosum and T. benhamiae can be seen concurrently in cattle.
