Deep-sea trenches, depths 6000-11,000 m, are characterized by high pressures, low temperatures, and absence of sunlight. These features make up the majority of the deepest marine habitat-the hadal zone-home to distinct communities from those in the surrounding abyssal plains. The snailfishes, family Liparidae (Scorpaeniformes), have found notable success in the hadal zone from ∼6000 to 8200 m, comprising the dominant ichthyofauna in at least six trenches worldwide. The hadal fish community is distinct from the abyssal community where elongate, scavenging fishes such as rattails (Macrouridae), cutthroat eels (Synaphobranchidae), tripodfishes (Ipnopidae), eelpouts (Zoarcidae), and cusk eels (Ophidiidae) are most common. Until recently, little was known about the biology of these deepest-living fishes, or the factors that drive their success at hadal depths. Here, I review recent investigations spanning the abyssal-hadal boundary and discuss the factors structuring these communities, including the roles of pressure adaptation, feeding ecology, and life history. Hadal fishes show specialized adaptation to hydrostatic pressure both in accumulation of the pressure-counteractant trimethylamine <i>n</i>-oxide and in intrinsic changes to enzymes. Stomach content and amino acid isotope analyses, and jaw morphology suggest that suction-feeding predatory fishes like hadal liparids may find an advantage to descending into the trench where amphipods are increasingly abundant. Analysis of otolith growth zones suggest that snailfishes may be adapted to a seismically active, high-disturbance hadal environment by having relatively short life-spans. This review synthesizes the known literature on the planet's deepest-living fishes and informs new understanding of adaptations to life in the trenches.
