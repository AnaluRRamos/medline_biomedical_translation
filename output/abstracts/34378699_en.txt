This paper discusses the low power of traditional care offers for so-called complex users in the health sector. It aims to show, from the narratives of two guiding-users, that professionals, services, and policies disregard the multiple singularities involved in the care and attempt to overlap their knowledge in asymmetrical relationships. They are often put at stake in their ability to generate interesting and more life-producing offers. In this sense, this work built on two qualitative, cartographic studies that aimed to reflect, based on two guiding-users, promoting considerations on how contact with the field/territory and the meeting with these two women (guiding-users) deterritorialized concepts and affected researchers and research. The results indicate that cartography allows the production of the common, understood as a way of operating health work. Here, one seeks to consider each subject's unique individual power as a fundamental issue for the production of care. The disease leaves the scenario as a guide, vulnerability as fragility or impotence, to make way for the 'defense of a life worth living' as a guide. Possible lives that users generate, whether or not they are in the streets and a vulnerable condition.
