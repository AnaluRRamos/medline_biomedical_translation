Reflection study on the nutritional guidelines given to the population, which, in most parts of the world, emphasize on the consumption of fruits, vegetables and legumes over industrialized foods, which contain more sugar, sodium and calories, and increase body weight. However, when one reads about the ways of cultivating fresh food and about the quality of meat and fish products destined for consumption, the question arises as to whether there is coherence between said guidance and consumption, given that there are reports of contamination of these foods by pesticide residues, as well as soil and water contamination, a topic scarcely addressed by state entities. What should be done to face this reality? A viable perspective is to raise awareness in the population, which should demand better quality foods, in addition to returning to healthier practices such as the cultivation of home-grown organic gardens and acquiring as few industrialized foods as possible. Far from causing controversy, this reflection aims to encourage a critical view in health professionals on their role in disease prevention and the demand for healthier foods for human consumption.
