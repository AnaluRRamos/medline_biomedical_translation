The scope of this study was to assess the prevalence and factors associated with frailty among the elderly in Primary Health Care. It is a cross-sectional study carried out with 1750 elderly people in the Southeast of Brazil. The Brazilian Older American Resources and Services Multidimensional Functional Assessment Questionnaire (BOMFAQ) and the Clinical-Functional Vulnerability Index (CFVI) were used for data collection. Descriptive and bivariate analyzes were performed, followed by Poisson regression analysis, with robust variance, to obtain adjusted prevalence ratios (PR). The CFVI identified 357 frail elderly people (20.1%). The variables that remained statistically associated with frailty after multiple analysis were: single/widowed (PR = 1.05; 95%CI = 1.02-1.07); four years of schooling (PR = 1.05; 95%CI = 1.03-1.08); polypathology (PR = 1.05; 95%CI = 1.01-1.09); polypharmacy (PR = 1.21; 95%CI = 1.17-1.26); mental disorder (PR = 1.16; 95%CI = 1.12-1.21); cognitive impairment (PR = 1.71; 95%CI = 1.57-1.86); Daily Living Activity impairment (PR = 1.12; 95%CI = 1.09-1.14); falls (PR = 1.06; 95%CI = 1.03-1.10); hospitalization (PR = 1.39; 95%CI = 1.27-1.52); urinary incontinence and self-perception of health. The conclusion that a significant prevalence of frailty in the study reaffirms the need for a multidimensional approach to the elderly.
