Vertical HIV transmission is still an important global public health problem. This study aimed to verify vertical HIV transmission in Rio Branco, Acre, Brazil, and to assess the possibility of its elimination. A cross-sectional study was conducted of HIV in pregnant women and a longitudinal study on the incidence of vertical HIV transmission in pregnant women living in the municipality (county) of Rio Branco in 2007-2015. The cohorts of pregnant women consisted of women who had liveborn children, stillbirths, or abortions. The data were obtained from the Brazilian Information System for Notificable Diseases (SINAN), Brazilian Information System on Live Births (SINASC), Brazilian Mortality Information System (SIM), and Brazilian Hospital Information Systems (SIH). Databases. Probabilistic database linkage was performed with the OpenRecLink software. The authors calculated the HIV prevalence rate in pregnant women, the vertical transmission rate, and the principal associated factors. HIV prevalence in pregnant women showed an upward trend, and the mean prevalence was 0.18%. Variables statistically associated with the occurrence of HIV in pregnant women were maternal age â‰¥ 20 years (p = 0.007), lower schooling (p = 0.054), and unmarried conjugal status/without partner (p = 0.001). Vertical HIV transmission was 6.9%. Use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) during prenatal care, even among pregnant women that already knew they were HIV-positive, was less than 90%. The elective cesarean rate was less than 60%, and the use of ART during delivery and by the newborn in the first 24 hours showed variations, depending on the period in which the maternal diagnosis was made. Although the strategies for the elimination of vertical HIV transmission are well established, this study's results point to important flaws in the cascade of care for HIV-infected pregnant women in Rio Branco.
