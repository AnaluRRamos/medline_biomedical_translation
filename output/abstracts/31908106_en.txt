Genetic skin diseases in cattle are rare. A 7-week-old female Holstein calf was presented with epidermal lesions and alopecia in the caudal region of the ears and on the neck, as well as deep bilateral ulcerative lesions on the palmar aspect of the metacarpi and dorsal aspect of the right metacarpus. Clinical, pathological and histopathological examination of the calf was suggestive of a subepidermal vesicular dermatosis. Genetic analysis identified a de novo non-sense variant affecting the aspartate dehydrogenase domain containing (ASPDH) gene, which might be associated with the formation of subepidermal vesicles in this case. The observed phenotype in the calf may represent a novel form of a vesicular skin disorder. Haploinsufficiency of the ASPDH gene might be considered as a possible cause.
