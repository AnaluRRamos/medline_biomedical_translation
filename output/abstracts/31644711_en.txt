There was an association of the fear of speaking with the vocal self-perception, with the ability to capture and keep the listener's attention and to influence another with their communication. Individuals who have the ability to capture and maintain the attention of the interlocutor are more likely to be afraid of public speaking than the undergraduate students who perceive themselves as having the ability to influence the listener with their communication. The more communicative skills and more persuasive the individual perceives his or her self, the less likely he or she is to be affected by the fear of speaking.
