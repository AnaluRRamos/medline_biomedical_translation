Persistent embryological connections between the anterior and posterior circulations are rare entities. Persistent hypoglossal artery is the second most common persistent carotid-basilar anastomosis. As it is often associated with hypoplasia of vertebral arteries, it poses a challenge during endovascular interventions. We present a case of a 32-year-old woman who presented with occipital headache of four weeks' duration. Magnetic Resonance Angiography showed hypoplastic vertebral arteries with a persistent hypoglossal artery arising from the cervical segment of the left internal carotid artery and supplying the entire posterior circulation, associated with a dissecting aneurysm of the right posterior cerebral artery. Endovascular parent vessel occlusion was performed for the dissecting posterior cerebral artery aneurysm by navigating the guide catheter, microwire, and microcatheter through the persistent hypoglossal artery because the vertebral arteries were hypoplastic. Post-intervention, the patient did not develop any neurological deficit and was discharged in a stable condition.
