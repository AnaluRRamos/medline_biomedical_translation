Cognitive impairment and dementia commonly occur in individuals with chronic kidney disease, especially in advanced stages, but are still poorly diagnosed. To evaluate the cognitive ability of patients with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis and its relationship with sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. A cross-sectional study was carried out in a Renal Replacement Therapy Unit in the interior of the State of São Paulo involving 99 patients. The data were collected through an individual interview, using the Sociodemographic and Clinical Characterization questionnaires and the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination - Revised (ACE-R) questionnaire. Participants were predominantly male, with a mean age of 54.68 years. The mean ACE-R score was 64.26 points, and 76.76% of patients had lower-than-expected scores, suggesting the presence of cognitive impairment. A moderate, negative correlation was found between total score on the ACE-R and age (r= -0.38, p≤0.001), a moderate positive correlation with years of education (r=0.52, p≤0.001), and a weak positive correlation of total score with hemodialysis time (r=0.26, p≤0.001). A relationship was found between cognitive ability and age, years of education and hemodialysis time, suggesting that individuals who were older, had less education and longer hemodialysis time presented greater cognitive impairment.
