There is growing concern about the economic impact of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in Brazil and worldwide. To estimate the economic impact of CVD in Brazil in the last five years. The information to estimate CVD costs was taken from national databases, adding the direct costs with hospitalizations, outpatient visits and benefits granted by social security. Indirect costs were added to the calculation, such as loss of income caused by CVD morbidity or mortality. CVD mortality accounts for 28% of all deaths in Brazil in the last five years and for 38% of deaths in the productive age range (18 to 65 years). The estimated costs of CVD were R$ 37.1 billion in 2015, a 17% increase in the period from 2010 to 2015. The estimated costs of premature death due to CVD represent 61% of the total cost of CVD, Direct costs with hospitalizations and consultations were 22%, and costs related to the loss of productivity related to the disease were 15% of the total. Health expenditures in Brazil are estimated at 9.5% of GDP and the average cost of CVD was estimated at 0.7% of GDP. CVD costs have increased significantly in the last five years. It is estimated that CVD costs increase as the Brazilian population ages and the prevalence of CVD increases.
