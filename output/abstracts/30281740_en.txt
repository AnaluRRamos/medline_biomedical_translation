The objective of this research was to analyze the factors associated with the Food and Nutrition Surveillance System (Sisvan Web) coverage for children under five years of age in the municipalities of the Regional Health Inspectorate of Belo Horizonte (HRS-BH). Sisvan Web coverage data were collected from September to October 2012. Simultaneously, a 'semi-structured questionnaire about the Sisvan operation' was sent to identify the technical references of municipalities studied. The coverage was calculated by dividing the number of under five-year-old children covered by Sisvan by the total number of similarly under five-year-old children obtained from the 2010 IBGE census. The Median Sisvan Web coverage of children in the HRS-BH municipalities was 5.59%, with coverage values ranging from 0.55% to 35.8%. Among the variables studied, the only one that revealed significant statistical association (p < 0.05) with Sisvan Web coverage was the lack of professionals to collect data. The results revealed the need for greater awareness of health managers and public health professionals about the importance of the nutritional diagnosis situation of the population through Sisvan Web.
