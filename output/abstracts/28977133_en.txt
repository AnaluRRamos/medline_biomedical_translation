To analyze the association between perceived stress in adolescence, body weight and romantic relationships. Participants were 2,571 adolescents (56.1% female), with mean age of 16.6Â±1.2 years, who were students of public schools in Amazonas. The adolescents answered a questionnaire with sociodemographic questions (sex, age group, school year, study shift, maternal schooling and family income) and related to body weight dissatisfaction, romantic relationships (identified by the relationship status - with or without a partner) and perceived stress (dependent variable). Binary Logistic Regression was used to test the association between perceived stress, body weight dissatisfaction and romantic relationships. The analysis was adjusted by sex and age group. The prevalence of perceived stress was 19.0% (95% confidence interval - 95%CI 17.5-20.3), and was higher among girls (23.2%; 95%CI 21.5-24.5) than boys (13.6%; 95%CI 12.2-14.7). Adolescents with partners (OR 1.76; 95%CI 1.14-2.71) and those who wanted to lose body weight (OR 1.53; 95%IC 1.18-1.98) were more likely to perceive themselves as stressed. There was an association between perceived stress, relationship status and body weight dissatisfaction. Regardless of sex and age group, the adolescents with a partner and those who wanted to lose weight were more likely to perceive themselves as stressed. Girls should receive special attention, as well as adolescents with partners and those who want to lose body weight.
