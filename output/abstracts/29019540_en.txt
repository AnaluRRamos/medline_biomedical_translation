to evaluate the efficacy of three immunohistochemical markers involved in the wound healing process. experimental study of 40 Wistar rats of the markers metalloproteinases and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), beta transforming growth factor (TGF-β) and myofibroblasts and smooth muscle actin alpha (α-MLA) markers, studied from fragments of surgical scar of abdominal incision involving skin, aponeurosis and peritoneum. The animals were divided into four subgroups of ten according to the day of death, scheduled in three, seven, 14 and 21 days. MMP-9 expression showed a progressive increase of its concentration, more evident from 7th to 14th days, varying the tissue immunoexpression between 2.65% and 11.50% . TGF- β showed expression at high level on the 3rd day, fell in the 7th, rising again in the 14th, with a small decrease in the 21st day, varying the tissue immunoexpression between 0.03% and 2.92%. The α-AML presented levels with little variation and a slight increase, varying the tissue immunoexpression between 0.88% and 3.23%. MMP-9 presented as the best marker, followed by TGF-β. However, α-AML was not a good indicator of the evolution of tissue repair.
