To compare muscle thickness and subcutaneous fat in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and healthy controls using ultrasonography (US), and to correlate US findings with nutritional, clinical and functional variables. Patients aged 6 to 18 years old with a diagnosis of CF and healthy controls were included. Participants underwent anthropometric measurements, an ultrasonographic evaluation of muscle thickness and subcutaneous fat in the triceps, quadriceps, and gastrocnemius regions, and skinfold thickness measurements. Body fat percentage was estimated using skinfold measurement. Subjects with CF also underwent a pulmonary function assessment using spirometry. We studied 39 CF patients and 45 controls. Alower body mass index was observed in CF patients (p=0.011). Body composition and muscle thickness were similar between the groups. Only calf (p=0.023) circumference and femur diameter (p<0.001) were lower in CF patients. Although there were no significant between-group differences in the comparison of US measurements of subcutaneous fat, CF patients exhibited decreased skinfold thickness in the triceps (p=0.031) and quadriceps (p=0.019). Moreover, there were weak and moderate correlations of US quadricep thickness with forced vital capacity (FVC) and lean mass, respectively. Moderate correlations of the triceps, quadriceps and gastrocnemius between US subcutaneous fat and skinfold measurements were found. Patients with CF presented a reduction in subcutaneous fat content. Muscle thickness correlated with FVC and nutritional parameters. In addition, US findings correlated positively with skinfold measurements.
