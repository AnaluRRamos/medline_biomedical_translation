to evaluate the radiographic results from patients with bilateral developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) who underwent surgical treatment by means of open reduction and Salter osteotomy, with or without associated femoral shortening as described by Ombrédanne. this was a retrospective descriptive study in which 21 patients with bilateral DDH (42 hips) were analyzed. They were treated at Hospital Infantil Joana de Gusmão (HIJG), with operations between August 1997 and October 2009. To evaluate the radiographic results, the acetabular index and the Wiberg center-edge angle were measured, and the Severin and Kalamchi-MacEwen classifications were used. Descriptive and parametric statistical analyses were used to evaluate the data. we did not observe any statistically significant difference in analyzing the radiographic parameters, making comparisons regarding the side affected, the order of the procedures and whether femoral shortening was performed, although there was a significant difference between them from before to after the operation. open reduction in association with iliac osteotomy as described by Salter presented significant improvements in the radiographic parameters analyzed, comparing the pre- and postoperative values. This improvement occurred independently of whether Ombrédanne femoral shortening was performed. The most prevalent complication in the study group was avascular necrosis of the femoral head.
