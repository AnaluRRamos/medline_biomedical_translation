to identify the factors associated with mortality in mitral valve reoperation, to create a predictive model of mortality and to evaluate the EuroSCORE. a total of 65 patients were evaluated from January 2008 to December 2017. It was verified the association of variables with death and a multiple logistic regression model was used to stratify patients. hospital mortality was 13.8% and in the Death Group: EuroSCORE was 12.33±8.87 (p=0.017), the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 45.33±5.10 (p=0.000), the creatinine was 1.56±0.29 (p=0.002), the prothrombin time (TAP) was 1.64 (p=0.001), pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PSAP): 66.1±13.6 (p=0.002), female: 88% (p=0.000), malnutrition: 77.7% (p=0.007), associated tricuspid disease: 44,4% (p=0.048), presence of ventricular arrhythmia: 77.7% (p=0.005), implantation of a biological prosthesis: 55.5% (p=0.034), bronchopneumonia and sepsis: 33,3% (p=0.048), systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS): 55.5% (p=0.001), low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS): 88.8% (p=0.000). the factors associated with mortality were: EuroSCORE, LVEF, creatinine, TAP, PSAP, female, malnutrition, tricuspid disease, ventricular arrhythmia, implantation of biological prosthesis, SIRS, SBDC, bronchopneumonia and sepsis. The explanatory variables of death of the model were: EuroSCORE, creatinine, TAP, LVEF, length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU), interval between surgeries and presence of ventricular arrhythmia. The high EuroSCORE is related to higher mortality.
