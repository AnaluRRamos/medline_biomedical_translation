Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) is a rare immune-mediated dermatitis. To the best of the authors' knowledge it has not been described in donkeys. A 5-year-old male neutered donkey, living in south-east France, was diagnosed with CLE. Clinical signs included generalized symmetrical areas of alopecia, erythema, crusting and scales. Diagnostic tests included examination of skin biopsy samples by histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis which demonstrated an interface dermatitis with CD8+ T cells. The skin condition was successfully treated initially with glucocorticoids and methotrexate; successful long-term maintenance was associated with administration of methotrexate.
