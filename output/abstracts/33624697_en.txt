The study aims to understand the influence of communicational relations among healthcare professionals in the coordination of care between levels. This is a qualitative study with data from the international multicenter study Equity-LA II, with dialectic hermeneutics as the theoretical reference. The authors listened to the audios from 15 interviews with professionals (7 physicians from primary care and 5 from specialized care, and 3 institutional supporters from primary care) in a municipal network in the Agreste region of the state of Pernambuco, Brazil, in 2016. The mixed categories were submitted to content analysis. The analysis revealed a lack of recognition, by nearly all of the professionals, of primary care as the organizational backbone for care, and the perception of coordination revealed obstacles related to disconnects in establishing dialogical relations. Knowledge of the physician's role in primary care is incomplete, and its praxis is viewed with distrust by specialists, while the reciprocal is not true. There was a visibly non-dialogical interpersonal relationship, based on asymmetric relations reflected in the specialist's authoritarian stance and that of inferiority of primary care physicians. The basis for the communicative action relates to pretensions of validity rather than of power, which is external to language, and impedes the discussion of reasons and arguments. There was little disposition for dialogue and reciprocal recognition between the parties involved, with interdiction of a communicative situation in which there is symmetry of participation. The results revealed communicational weaknesses, thus requiring strategies that allow achieving communicative understanding among the professionals and promoting satisfactory patient follow-up between levels of care.
