The objective of this work was to present the theory, propose the practice and evaluate the difficulties of the new food classification system that was presented in the second edition of the Dietary Guidelines for the Brazilian Population. The questionnaire used included a list of 30 foods divided into four groups: in natura or minimally processed foods (I), culinary ingredients (C), processed foods (P) and ultra-processed foods (U). The participants categorized the foods before and after a mini-course. The correct classification score in the Global Assessment (C, I, U, P) was significantly higher after the mini-course (Median = 23) than before the mini-course (Median = 13) (Wilcoxon Signal Test; z = -7.33; p = 0.000; Cliff's Delta Î´ = 0.96). The low percentage of correct answers before the mini-course justifies the wide dissemination of the theme and the need for more similar courses for students, professionals and the general population.
