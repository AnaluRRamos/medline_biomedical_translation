To verify the association between negative self-perception of health and school violence in adolescent students of the Municipality of Olinda (PE), Brazil. This is a cross-sectional, analytical and school-based study with a sample consisting of 2,614 adolescents selected through a strategy of random sampling in conglomerates. The information was obtained through the questionnaire 'Youth Risk Behavior Survey' from which the issues of violence and self-perceived health were retrieved. Data were tabulated by Epi-data version 3.1 program and transcribed for SPSS version 22. The Chi-square test and the stepwise binary logistic regression model were used for data analysis. We observed that 26.7% of adolescents had a negative self-perception of health, and this was greater among girls. Concerning school violence, negative self-perception was associated with feelings of sadness, suicidal thoughts, bullying at school, robbery at school and safety at school. Gender and age were also associated (p < 0.05). We reinforce the need for culture and peace actions in adolescence, involving the school environment to reflect on poor health assessed by adolescents and reduce the rate of violence.
