Sixty years after Erving Goffman's book The Presentation of Self In Everyday Life was published (1959), this article reconstructs its biography by adapting the perspective of Robert Darnton (the original, as well as the revisited one on the history of books). Original texts by Goffman in Brazilian translations are used, along with bibliographical studies, critical articles, reviews, collections, and interviews and information that are part of the Erving Goffman Archives. The goal is to follow this author's trajectory, emphasizing the importance and impact of his text, with quantitative and qualitative data that extend beyond academia in terms of importance.
