Broad-encompassing approaches to the evaluation, documentation and discussion of workplace health assets are needed to implement effective interventions and promote health and well-being among workers through effective efforts in programs and initiatives to maintain and improve workplace health and safety. To perform the cross-cultural adaptation of the Indicators of Integration (II) scorecard to the Brazilian Portuguese language to enable its use in Brazil and thus provide organizations a means to evaluate the integration of workers' health and well-being programs, policies and practices. We followed scientific recommendations described in previous studies and carried out the process of adaptation along six steps: translation, reconciliation of translations, back translation into the original language, revision of the Portuguese version by an internal expert committee, pretest with an expert panel, and final review. The methods applied resulted in an adequate instrument for self-evaluation of the integration of workers' health and well-being programs and practices in organizations; the adapted version conserves the properties of the original. The Brazilian version of the II scorecard - entitled <i>Indicadores Integrados de Práticas de Saúde na Organização</i> (IIPSO) - obtained in the present study is appropriate to be administered and to measure the implementation and integration of health, safety and well-being actions.
