The scope of this article is to evaluate the Worker Food Program from the viewpoint of managers, nutritionists and the food offered in industries of the Metropolitan Region of Recife. It consisted of a cross-sectional study. A structured questionnaire was filled out by 40 managers and 40 nutritionists regarding their knowledge about the program and compliance with the tasks required by it. The nutritional quality of the menus was also evaluated. Among the managers and nutritionists, 22.5% and 72.5%, respectively, did not know about the enrolment in the program and the nutritional requirements involved. Most nutritionists and managers related the program to a labor law requirement. None of the respondents knew about the mandatory food and nutritional education actions, even though 55% of the services involved educational actions and 25% performed nutritional assessment of the workers. It was found that, despite the daily supply of natural beverages, fruit and leafy vegetables, there is also a daily supply of various ultra-processed products, especially sweet foods and artificial beverages. The study revealed the lack of knowledge of managers and nutritionists about the objectives of the program as well as its incipient execution.
