To evaluate functional outcomes, radiographic findings and complications of proximal humeral fractures treated with locking plates and to determine prognostic factors for successful clinical outcomes. Forty patients undergoing internal fixation of fractures of the proximal humerus with the Philos<sup>®</sup> plate were included in the study. The surgeries were performed between 2004 and 2011 and the patients underwent radiographic and clinical evaluation, by Constant-Murley and Dash score. Outcomes were analyzed by use of multivariate regression with several different variables. Patients were on average of 61.8 ± 16.28 years, and most were female (70%). The Constant-Murley score was 72.03 ± 14.01 and Dash score was 24.96 ± 19.99. The postoperative radiographs showed a head-shaft angle of 135.43° ± 11.82. Regression analysis showed that the patient's age and the Hertel classification influenced the Constant-Murley scale (<i>p</i> = 0.0049 and 0.012, respectively). Other prognostic criteria such as Neer and AO classification, head-shaft angle, the presence of metaphyseal comminution and extension of the humeral metaphyseal fragment showed no effect on prognosis. Complications occurred in four patients (10%). The fixation with the Philos<sup>®</sup> plate provided good clinical and radiographic results in fractures of the proximal humerus, with a low complication rate. Patient's age and Hertel classification were defined as prognostic factors that led to worse functional outcomes.
