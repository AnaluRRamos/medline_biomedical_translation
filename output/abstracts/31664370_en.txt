This research had the objective of reporting a clinical case in which the rehabilitation of tongue strength with biofeedback strategy was performed. This case report addresses a 20-year-old patient whose orofacial myofunctional evaluation revealed a severe decrease in the force of the anterior third of the tongue and changes in lingual mobility and coordination. The measurement of tongue pressure was performed using the Iowa Oral Performance Instrument (IOPI) during elevation, protrusion and lateralization, and it was verified a reduction in the values ​​obtained in all measured directions, compared with normality patterns. We performed 11 sessions of therapy, with weekly frequency, using a biofeedback strategy that consisted of computer games controlled by the tongue. An instrument embedded in the oral cavity functioned as a joystick as the input method for specific digital games. The patient performed at home the isometric exercises of pressing the tip of the tongue against a spatula, exaggerated retraction of tongue, tongue tapering, and isotonic exercise of touching the commissures and lips alternately, daily. After eight sessions, in relation to the elevation pressure, there was an improvement of 28.6% for the apex and 7.1% for the dorsum. As for protrusion, there was an improvement of 123.5%. In the measurements of left and right lateralization, the values ​​increased 53.8% and 7.4%, respectively. After twelve sessions, it was observed an improvement of 35.7%, 7.4%, 164%, 76.9% and 40.7% in relation to the initial evaluation, for apex elevation, dorsum elevation, protrusion, and lateralization to left and right, respectively. Despite the increase, values ​​recommended in the literature as normal for sex and age were not reached after 12 therapy sessions.
