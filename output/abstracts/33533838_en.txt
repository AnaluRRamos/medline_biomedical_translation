This paper aims to identify sociodemographic and care characteristics of dependent older adults, formal and family caregivers in municipalities from different Brazilian regions. A cross-sectional study was carried out with a sample of 175 people, of whom 64 were older adults, 27 formal caregivers, and 84 family caregivers. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with specific questions for each group on the theme of care and dependence. Most older adults were female, aged 80 years or older, with low education and have been dependent for four years or more. Older adults reported feelings of loneliness, pointed out difficulties in medical care, and 29% had only access to Primary Health Care actions. Inequalities, burden, illnesses, and social problems were found among family caregivers. Black females with no formal employment, little or no training for the function, and low remuneration predominated among formal caregivers, and care was associated with domestic chores. We can conclude that gender and race inequalities persist in the care of dependent older adults, and we observed that the rigid social roles assigned to men and women in Brazil persist in the family and work dynamics in caring for the dependent older adults.
