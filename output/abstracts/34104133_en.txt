Genetic factors can be responsible for part of the populational and interindividual differences observed in warfarin users. To identify occurrence of polymorphisms of the CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genes in patients taking warfarin and relate these profiles to their medication dosages and the Time in Therapeutic Range (TTR). Monthly interviews were conducted for data collection. Data were collected on demographic characteristics and medications in use, especially warfarin, including reason for prescription and weekly dose. TTR was calculated as the percentage of days with international normalized ratio (INR) between 2 and 3. The CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genes were analyzed at a Human Genetics Laboratory. 49 patients (74.2%) had polymorphisms of the CYP2C9 and/or VKORC1 genes; the remaining 17 (25.8%) did not have these polymorphisms. The average weekly dose of warfarin was lower among those who had a polymorphism for any of the genes compared to those who did not, with a significant difference (p = 0.035). The mean TTR was also lower among patients with polymorphism. However, the difference between the two groups was not significant for this variable (p = 0.438). An association was observed between the polymorphisms and the warfarin doses taken by the patients. However, there was no association with adverse events or the time spent within the therapeutic range in this sample.
