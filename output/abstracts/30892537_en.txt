The scope of this article is to analyze the temporal trend of the consumption of fatty meats and factors associated with the consumption thereof between 2007 and 2014. A time series of fatty meat consumption (red meat and chicken) was conducted by the 'Surveillance of Risk and Protection Factors for Chronic Diseases (Vigitel) telephone survey.' The consumption trend was analyzed by joinpoint regression and expressed in annual percentage variation (VPA [95% CI]), while sociodemographic and behavioral factors were associated in 2007 and 2014 by the generalized linear (log-binomial) model. Between 2007 and 2014, white meat consumption â‰¥ 5x/ week increased (VPA 6.9% [5.7, 8.1]), while red meat consumption remained stable. Fatty meat consumption showed a significant reduction as of 2011 (VPA -4% [-7.5; -0.2]), probably due to the reduction in the consumption of fatty red meats. It was found that males, of younger age groups living in the center-west/south-east/south regions, with low education level and alcohol and tobacco abuse were associated with fatty meat consumption; while watching television>3hours/day was only associated in 2014. The consumption of fatty meats showed a reduction trend in the Brazilian population, and its consumption was associated with sociodemographic and behavioral variables.
