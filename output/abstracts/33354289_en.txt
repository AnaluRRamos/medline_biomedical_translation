Intentionality to remember is associated with better performances in episodic memory retrieval. The practice effect has better performance in memory retrieval. However, little is known about the effect of intentionality on memory over days and the influence of age, gender, and level of education on it as well as on practice effect. To verify the effect of intentionality and practice effect on memory performance over days, using an ecological approach. One hundred and twenty subjects from 18 to 81 years of age and free of psychiatric and neurological disorders were evaluated. They were randomized into a 'testing effect group' and a 'intentionality group' and then were asked to read a text on the FIFA World Cup. The 'intentionality group' was instructed to pay careful attention to the text because they would answer a questionnaire with 10 factual items from the text after 2 and 7 days. The 'testing effect group' had the same procedure at the same time as the first group but were not instructed about the intentionality, and answered the questionnaire immediately after reading the text. Memory performance was better 2 days after the exposure session than 7 days later in the 'intentionality group'. On the other hand, there was no difference in memory performance from the 'testing effect group' 2 and 7 days later. Intention to recall may enhance memory over a short period of days, while retaining similar amount of information over days to what was acquired immediately after text exposure.
