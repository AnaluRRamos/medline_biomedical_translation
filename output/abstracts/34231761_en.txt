The exchange of information between appliers of mental health interventions is essential to guarantee effective program implementation. The study aimed to examine how individual and group factors influence the exchange of information among the implementers of a psychosocial intervention program targeted to victims of the war in Colombia. A cross-sectional exploratory design was developed. Interviews were held with 18 psychologists, 22 social workers, 10 community promoters, and a nurse. The study used the E-i index and the visualization of interclass and intraclass links. There is no homophilic tendency in the exchange of information among the three professional categories. Empowerment predicts the nominations received in the request for information network (β = 0.296, p < 0.006). To be central in the preference network is the principal predictor of receiving requests for information (β = 0.562, p < 0.0001). Empowered professionals and those who exchange information on the implementation process are considered key informants that can improve the program's effectiveness.
