The pathogenesis of feline allergic dermatitis (FAD) is unclear, with several differences from allergic dermatitis in dogs and humans. To survey cytokine expression levels in healthy cats and cats affected with allergic dermatitis or asthma. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded skin biopsies from 22 cats with allergic dermatitis and 21 cats without allergic dermatitis were used for cutaneous assays. Serum was obtained from 17 healthy cats, 18 cats with allergic dermatitis, and 18 cats with a presumptive diagnosis of asthma. Cutaneous mRNA expression was evaluated with quantitative PCR [interleukin (IL)-31 and IL-31 Receptor A] and RNA in situ hybridisation (ISH) [IL-5, IL-31, IL-31RA, IL-33 and Oncostatin M receptor (OSMR)-β]. IL-31 protein concentrations were evaluated in serum with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Serum levels of 19 additional cytokines were evaluated using a Luminex panel. IL-31, IL-31RA, IL-5 and IL-33 mRNA expression were either expressed in low quantities or undetectable in most samples. By contrast, OSMR-β expression was significantly higher in the skin of allergic versus healthy cats (P < 0.0001). Although serum IL-31 was detected in a larger number of cats with allergic dermatitis than healthy cats, and concentrations appeared to be higher in cats with allergies, this difference was not statistically significant. Cats affected by asthma also exhibited insignificantly higher concentrations of IL-31 in the serum. Our results suggest that feline allergic diseases may exhibit different pathomechanisms from allergic diseases affecting other species. These findings are useful in guiding further therapeutic development toward targets that may have a role in the pathogenesis of feline allergic skin disease.
