Dermatophytosis is a superficial fungal skin disease of animals. A key part of treatment is cleaning and disinfection of the environment to prevent false-positive results due to fomite carriage. Furthermore, there is a perception in the lay literature that decontamination of homes is difficult or impossible. Data from a 10 year period identified 70 foster family homes where Microsporum canis infected cats had lived for varying periods of time. Mechanical debris was removed from the rooms housing the cats, the areas cleaned with over-the-counter household detergents, rinsed and hard surfaces disinfected with 1:100 concentration household bleach or accelerated hydrogen peroxide. Thirty-eight homes were completely decontaminated after one cleaning post removal or cure of the cat. Of the remaining homes, decontaminated was achieved after one (n=28), two (n=2) or three (n=1) additional cleanings. Complete decontamination was not possible in one home; the foster family was admittedly noncompliant. There was no evidence of disease transmission to other animals or people. Environmental decontamination is not difficult in homes exposed to M. canis and can be accomplished with established procedures.
