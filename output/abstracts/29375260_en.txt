To evaluate the age in which the secondary ossification centers of the elbow appear and fuse in the Brazilian population. Nearly thirty radiographs were randomly selected for each age group from 0 to 18 years, with a total of 544 radiographs from 439 patients, between 2010 and 2015, without abnormalities secondary to trauma, metabolic or bone tumor diseases. Radiographs were retrospectively evaluated by two blind and independent observers, according to the presence or not of the ossification centers, and the fusion between them. The age interval of appearance and fusion were, respectively: capitulum (0 to 1 year; 10 to 15 years), radius head (2 to 6 year; 12 to 16 years), medial epicondyle (2 to 8 years; 13 to 17 years), trochlea (5 to 11 years; 10 to 18 years), olecranon (6 to 11 years; 13 to 16 years), e lateral epicondyle (8 to 13 years; 12 to 16 years). Appearance and fusion were earlier in girls compared to boys (exception to capitulum and radius head). The chronological order was similar to the literature. For girls, the radius head and medial epicondyle appeared simultaneously. There was a tendency of the olecranon center to appear before the trochlea for both sexes. <b>Level of Evidence III, Diagnostic Study.</b>
