This study aims the treatment results of broad pectus excavatum after a long-term follow-up and skeletal maturity. Eighty-four children and adolescents with broad-type pectus excavatum were selected for evaluation after treatment with a dynamic orthosis that applies compression to the lower rib projections and prescription of exercises. The broad pectus excavatum was defined as a deformity that the depressed area was greater and covered the area above and below the nipple line. All patients were evaluated for more than 1 year after the end of treatment and skeletal maturity. Post-treatment results were categorized as mild, moderate and severe. Statistic correlations between results and deformity flexibility, deformity severity, and adherence to treatment were assessed. The mean age at the beginning of treatment was 13.3 years, and the follow-up duration was 25.7 months after suspension of orthosis use. Forty-eight percent of patients showed good results. With regular use of orthoses and performance of exercises, this rate increased to 70% (p < 0,001). Mild cases showed more success than severe cases (p = 0,007). Initial flexibility didn't influence the results (p = 0,63). Treatment of broad pectus excavatum with orthoses and exercises led to good definitive results in most resilient patients, especially in those with mild deformities. <b><i>Level of Evidence V, Expert Opinion</i>.</b>
