This paper highlights the advance of science in interpreting pandemics, in contrast to the failure of governments that politicized the approach to the global public health emergency resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. This study reflects on cognitive dissonance caused by the infodemic. It addresses the need to apply infodemiology to mitigate the deleterious effects of fake news intentionally fabricated to confuse, mislead, manipulate, and deny the reality without losing sight of the fact that the roots of the problem are historical, circumstantial, profound, and challenging. This work reveals the impacts of this situation for health professionals and exposes the fine line between freedom of expression and the fundamental right to life, leading to the conclusion that wrong choices in public health can cause preventable deaths.
