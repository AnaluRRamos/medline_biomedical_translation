The objective of this study was to assess the provision of information on the amount of sugar and identify the position of sugar in the list of ingredients of processed foods. A cross-sectional study was conducted to analyze all processed traditional and diet/light/zero food products sold in a hypermarket containing the word sugar or sucrose in the list of ingredients. The food labels were read and the position of sugar on the list of ingredients and presence, or absence, of information on the amount of sugar in the nutrition facts table were recorded. Information on the amount of sugar was also requested from the manufacturers by e-mail or telephone. A total of 2,200 food products were assessed, 2,164 (98.4%) of which were traditional foods and 36 (1.6%) diet/light/zero foods. The amount of sugar was declared in only 14.4% and 13.9% of these products, respectively (p=0.84). Only 7.7% (n=12) of the 156 companies contacted provided the requested information. Sugar was present in the first three positions of the list of ingredients in 75.8% of the traditional foods and 77.8% of the diet/light/zero foods (p=0.93). The data show that sugar was the main ingredient in the majority of the food products analyzed and that the level of provision of information on the amount of sugar is low.
