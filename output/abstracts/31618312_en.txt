To apply the standard time parameters of nursing activities proposed by COFEN Resolution No. 543/2017 to determine the number of nursing technicians in the material and sterilization center of a university hospital and compare the projected framework with the existing one in the sector. An exploratory and descriptive study with data collection performed on the sterilization control sheets and direct observation of the work process stages in the different sector areas. Only one of the 15 described activities was not conducted in the sector; those most performed which presented more workload and required more personnel were the receiving of contaminated materials and the organization and distribution of sterilized materials; the areas that required the highest number of employees were for materials preparation and cleaning/disinfection. No difference was observed between the number of staff required in the different work shifts, and the calculated staff quantity was similar to that existing in the result of the staff sizing performed using the functional sites. The proposals analyzed in this study can be used to calculate staff size in the studied sector and in other institutions.
