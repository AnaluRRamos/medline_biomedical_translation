To determine a relationship between smoking, alcohol abuse and anabolic steroids and meniscoligamentous injuries. A total of 239 patients underwent surgical treatment of isolated anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) lesion, ACL associated with meniscal injury and isolated meniscal injury, and were inquired by a single team of surgeons about their habits: smoking, alcoholism and use of artificial anabolic agents. In addition, quality of life was assessed using the SF-36 questionnaire. It was not possible to establish a direct relationship between habits and meniscal and ligamentous injuries, despite the finding that patients with ACL-associated lesions were more frequently smokers, and that patients with isolated meniscal injuries used more artificial anabolic agents. Regarding quality of life, there were no statistical differences in the habits between the groups; however, except for smokers with isolated meniscal injury, all patients who did not have the habits analyzed presented a better score in the SF-36 questionnaire. There were no significant findings correlating smoking, alcohol abuse and artificial anabolic agents with the presence of injuries. In addition, six months after the surgical treatment, there was no difference in the quality of life between the groups evaluated. <b><i>Level of Evidence III, Prospective case series.</i></b>
