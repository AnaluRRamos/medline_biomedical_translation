to evaluate the use of a bacterial cellulose biopolymer film and gel dressing in the treatment of patients with ischemic wounds submitted to lower limb revascularization. we conducted a randomized clinical trial in the Angiology and Vascular Surgery outpatient clinic of the Clinics Hospital of the Federal University of Pernambuco, between January 2017 and December 2018. We followed 24 patients after lower limb revascularization, divided into two groups: Experimental, treated with bacterial cellulose biopolymer film and gel, and Control, treated with essential fatty acids. Patients attended weekly appointments to change dressings and had their wound healing processes evaluated over a period of 90 days. the reduction of the ischemic wounds' areas after 30 days was 4.3cm2 (55%) on average for the experimental group, and the 5.5cm2 (48.5%) for the control group (p>0.05). The complete healing rate at 90 days was 34.8%, 50% in the experimental group and 18.2% in the control group (p=0.053). the bacterial cellulose biopolymer film associated with gel can be used as a dressing in the treatment of ischemic wounds of patients undergoing revascularization of the lower limbs.
