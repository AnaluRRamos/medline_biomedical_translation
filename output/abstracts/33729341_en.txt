Based on the Rede Cegonha guidelines that propose the strengthening of women's sexual and reproductive rights, we sought to present a brief overview of issues related to reproductive planning and to analyze obstetric practices in childbirth care for adolescents and women of advanced age in maternity hospitals linked to Rede Cegonha. Data were extracted from an assessment conducted in 2017, based on information from the interview with puerperal women and from the hospital record. For age extremes, the high proportion of unplanned pregnancies and low use of contraception means problems in accessing family planning programs. Adolescents are more exposed to the presence of a companion and less to the use of analgesia in labor. Advanced maternal age were more likely to use analgesia in labor and to give birth in the lithotomy position, being less exposed to amniotomy. Although Rede Cegonha is an excellent strategy for improving assistance to childbirth, attention is still needed to the use of potentially unnecessary or not recommended interventions, with greater incentive to good obstetric practices.
