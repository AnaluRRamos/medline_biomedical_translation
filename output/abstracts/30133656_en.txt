Obesity is associated with psychosocial problems like stigma, discrimination, and bias. Studies have found that nutritionists and nutrition students display negative attitudes and biases toward obese individuals. This study examined the existence of nutrition students' bias toward obese individuals. The students answered questionnaires by completing on-line forms with demographic data and self-reported weight and height and were assigned to one of four randomly selected hypothetical cases of patients referred to a nutritionist after receiving a diagnosis of lactose intolerance (normal weight man; normal weight woman; obese man; and obese woman). Except for weight, body mass index (BMI), and daily energy intake, all information on diet, habits, and health conditions were identical for profiles of the same sex. The questionnaire included questions on the indication of procedures and approaches during the consultation, consultation time, counseling strategies, dietary and health evaluation, and students' affective and behavioral reactions. Three hundred and thirty-five students participated, mostly women, with mean BMI of 23kg/mÂ². Patient's weight influenced consultation time and students' perceptions and treatment approaches and strategies. The study revealed biases and negative attitudes mainly involving the students' perceptions and reactions to obese patients, and obese women generally received the worse evaluations.
