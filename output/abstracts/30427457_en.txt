The aim of the study was to verify the prevalence of stress and associated factors in technical-administrative employees of a federal university of the south of Brazil. The sample was comprised of 371 civil servants. Sociodemographic, behavioral and occupational variables were collected. The occupational stress was measured by the Job Stress Scale (JSS). Data analysis was performed using descriptive and inferential statistics, through bivariate and multivariate analysis. Most subjects were female (57.4%) and the average age and education of the sample were, respectively, 45.1 years and 18 years of study. The workplace infrastructure was classified as inadequate by 42% of subjects. Of the civil servants, 22.7% were classified as being in high stress positions and 28% in passive work routines. In the adjusted analysis, occupational stress was associated with a lower level of education, poor workplace infrastructure and less social support. Individuals with adequate structure had odds of 2.79 and 2.30, respectively, of being in low stress and passive job positions. These aspects should be the focus of interventions by university managers to reduce the level of stress and risk of illness.
