This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of categories of adverse childhood experiences (ACE) among high school students in Rio de Janeiro, investigate the ACE co-occurrence profile, and examine the distribution of exposure to ACE according to individual, family, socioeconomic, and school characteristics. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 681 individuals selected using a complex random sampling design. Exposure to ACE categories was identified using a cross-culturally adapted version of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) and direct questions. We calculated prevalence and correlation between ACE pairs and determined the co-occurrence profile of childhood adversities. The findings reveal that the most common adversities were emotional abuse and neglect and biparental family dissolution. Seventy percent of the sample reported having been exposed to at least one ACE and 9% had been exposed to four or more. Around 20% of respondents reported exposure to abuse and neglect and 9% to the co-occurrence of abuse, neglect, and absence of at least one parent during childhood. The most vulnerable subgroups were girls and respondents who were born to teenage mothers, not living with both parents, studying at public schools, and from low-income families. The high prevalence and co-occurrence profile of ACE reveals the need for wide-ranging intersectoral policies designed to prevent adverse childhood experiences and provide victim support.
