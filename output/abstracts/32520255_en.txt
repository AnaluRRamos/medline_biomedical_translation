This study aimed to verify the prevalence of the use of Potentially Inappropriate Medications (PIM) for elderly living in Long-Term Care Institutions for the Elderly (LTCIE), as well as the types of medications and their associated factors. This is a cross-sectional study carried out in 10 LTCIEs in the city of Natal in the period October-December 2013. Potentially inappropriate medications were classified according to the 2015 American Geriatric Society Beers Criteria for Potentially Inappropriate Medication Use in Older Adults - 2015. Sociodemographic, LTCIE-related and health-related variables were considered. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed between the primary variable (PIM use) and the independent variables using Poisson regression. The sample consisted of 321 older people, of whom 304 used medications. The prevalence of PIM use was 54.6% (95% CI: 48.9-60.2) and was associated with polypharmacy and dementia in the final model. The most common PIMs were antipsychotics and benzodiazepines. The study revealed a high prevalence of PIM use among the elderly of the LTCIEs, evidencing the need to adopt indicators on the use of these drugs and the implementation of strategies that make drug therapy safer and more adequate for older adults.
