During a pandemic, economic, technological, and health systems' vulnerability become even more evident. A key challenge in Brazil is to control the trade deficit and difficulty in access to medicines and health products, even their development. Brazil's heavy external dependency on health inputs and products is one of the negative factors in confronting the global health emergency caused by SARS-CoV-2. The article aimed to discuss the vulnerabilities of the domestic chemical and biotechnological subsystem in the face of the current pandemic, with a focus on the pharmaceutical and biotech industry and the linkage between the fields of health and political economics. A qualitative study was performed with a literature review and analysis of secondary data as the methodological procedures. The results revealed low investment in public health, low innovation capacity, the pharmaceutical industry's profile, external dependency, currency exchange policy, patents, and other factors, demonstrating the major vulnerability in innovation and technology in the domestic pharmaceutical and biotech industry and the essential nature of linkage between various fields, especially health and the economy, for the incorporation of a systemic vision that creates the conditions to reduce vulnerabilities in the response to the pandemic and promote a development project for the country.
