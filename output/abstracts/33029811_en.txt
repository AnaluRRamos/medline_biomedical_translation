Straelensia cynotis, a trombidioid larval mite, was identified as a cause of nodular dermatitis in dogs in Southern Europe. It has been suggested that red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is a natural host for S. cynotis. However, no case has been reported in this species. To describe three suspected cases of straelensiosis in red foxes. Three juvenile wild red foxes from Portugal. Erythematous papules and nodules were found in the head, neck and limbs of these foxes with no associated pruritus. In skin biopsies, well-preserved larval mites were found within dilated hair follicles. These follicular lesions were multifocal and consisted of a degenerative and necrotic area nearby the parasite's mouthparts with marked pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia and perifollicular mucinosis. These features are considered pathognomonic in S. cynotis infestations in dogs. Treatment and outcome are outlined. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the present case series documents the first known occurrence of nodular dermatitis by Straelensia spp. in red foxes. This new evidence may corroborate participation of the red fox in the life cycle of S. cynotis.
