At the end of December 2019, SARS-COV-2 virus was identified as responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. The rapid spread of transmission exposed structural failures of modern societies and of the health systems in preventing and containing a health threat.

This is necessary to develop preventive strategies appropriate to population circumstances, especially with the most vulnerable population, in favor of health equity.
