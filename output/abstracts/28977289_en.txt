To investigate the prevalence of difficulties in adopting initial breastfeeding techniques and their association with breast disorders in postpartum women. The cross-sectional study was carried out with 276 randomly selected mother-baby pairs in rooming-in in 3 hospitals in a city of Minas Gerais State (southeast Brazil). An assessment protocol was established to evaluate the breastfeeding technique used. The association between the variables studied and breast disorders was determined by the chi-square test followed by logistic regression, with significance level set at 0.05. The main factors indicating difficulties to initiate the breastfeeding techniques were inadequate attachment of the baby to the breast (25%), baby response to the contact with the breast (26.1%) and breast disorders (28.3%). Variables associated with postparturm breast disorders were: adolescent mothers (OR 3.35; 95%CI 1.51-7.44; p=0.003); maternal schooling â‰¤8 years (OR 2.07; 95%CI 1.01-4.23; p=0.048); and supplement provision to the newborn at the hospital (OR 2.36; 95%CI 1.40-4.92; p=0.003). Mothers working outside the household (OR 0.31; 95%CI 0.16-0.61; p=0.001) served as as protective factor on the multivariate model. The main difficulties in initial breastfeeding were associated with breast disorders, and the factors associated with this problem included demographic and social, variables, as well as others related to the care routine adopted by maternity hospitals.
