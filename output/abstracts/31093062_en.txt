The distinctive features of the training system of health professionals and technicians in Cuba are characterized, and the adaptations of the educational models to meet the needs of health services and their adaptation to the socio-economic and scientific-technical environment are described. Education for health is universal, free and is closely linked to the National Health System. The curricula focus on the interrelation between academic training and clinical practice and community activity, whose fundamental form of teaching-learning is based on education at work. The fundamental principle of medical education is the integration of teaching, health care, and research within the health system, which ensures that students are embedded into the teaching-care scenarios through the interaction of the university with society. The curricular plans are based on the main health problems of the population and the environment, with emphasis on primary health care. Since 1959, nearly 350 000 professionals have graduated, including 41 000 foreign students. In addition, more than 30 000 students are trained in 12 countries with the Cuban international medical brigades. Currently, high enrollments increase the teaching-care burden of faculty staff and faculty is subject to frequent changes, representing a challenge to maintaining high-quality training. The scarcity of basic science teachers also affects training. The recruitment of teachers and young tutors needs to be encouraged.
